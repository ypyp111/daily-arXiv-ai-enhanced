Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection.

However, profound visual understanding and\ncomplex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local\ndetails than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though\noccupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information\nfor robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel\nframework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,\noften occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these\nclues with world knowledge for complex reasoning.

Our\nmethod uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse\naction features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining\nthe rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also\ncollected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression\nof both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our\nmethod achieves 48.41\\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,\nsignificantly outperforming human experts (21.33\\%) and the widely used method\nB-SOiD (30.52\\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only\nthree categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then\nour method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\\%, which is notably higher than that of\nhuman experts (48\\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\\%). Finally, our method revealed\ndifferences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot\nGabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug\nefficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application\nof our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related\ndrug development."}

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study.

Cross-Domain\nFew-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance\ndegradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation\nmodels on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,\ndriven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize\ndata transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS\napproaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS\nmethod that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target\ndomain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we\nfirst append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of\na pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the\nshared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the\nTSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and\na Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes\nglobal-local visual features to align image features across different views,\nwhile the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal\nfeatures (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the\noutputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent\nfusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.\nUnder both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average\nsegmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\\% and 4.11\\%, respectively, across\nfour cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS\nmethods.

This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as\nwell as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution\nto the core challenges in image fusion.

While recent works have explored MoE compression to\naddress this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy\ndrops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper\nintroduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model\ncompression while incurring minimal accuracy drops.

Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about\ntheir gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods\nfor determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most\nwell-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,\npalmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features\naccount for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris\nis a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,\nremains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris\nis externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for\npractical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for\nsegmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate\nselecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study\ndiscusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of\nliterature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of\nmethodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides\nresearchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification\napproaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this\nspecific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and\nfinally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement."}

In this paper, we\npropose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that\nmitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS\noperates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection\ntriggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby\npreventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our\napproach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural\nmodifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive\ngeneration pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks\n(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it\nreduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.\nIt also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across\nmodel architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3\nfamily) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value\nfor efficient reasoning."}

While standard Monte Carlo (MC)\nmethods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural\nnetwork architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating\nquadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature\nweights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of\nthe model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer\nencodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as\nwell as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers\nincorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the\nQuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is\npermutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall\ndomain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases,\nincluding integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the\nsolution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests,\nQuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard\nQuasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in\ncritical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This\nenhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the\noptimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based\nvariational solvers."}

Through rigorous evaluation across\nmultiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of\nproducing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more\nresistant to our attacks.

Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy.
