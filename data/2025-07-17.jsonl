However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%."}

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics."}

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive\ntraining of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial\ncomputational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward\nmodels or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and\nefficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image\ngeneration and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive\nexperiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO\ncompared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the\ntrained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent\nimages. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a\npaired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations\nand comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of\ngenerative models.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our\nfindings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more\nrobust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a\nnew perspective to study AI safety"}

In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment.

To address this, we propose HyperEvent, a framework\nreframing dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition. Central to\nHyperEvent is the dynamic construction of an association sequence using event\ncorrelation vectors. These vectors quantify pairwise dependencies between the\nquery event and relevant historical events, thereby characterizing the\nstructural cohesion of a potential hyper-event. The framework predicts the\noccurrence of the query event by evaluating whether it collectively forms a\nvalid hyper-event with these historical events.

While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local\nforecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in\nhandling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.\nThese methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally\nexpensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In\ncontrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance\nprediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through\nglobalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load\nforecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of\ndifferent modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore\nfeature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how\nglobalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In\naddition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its\npotential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the\nbalance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series\nclustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming\nmodels and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.\nThrough extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity\nload, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently\noutperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global\nfeatures and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming\nmodels face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring\nTSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively."}

To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner.

Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our\nmethod effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details\nafter demodulation.

While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's\ndistribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,\ncost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to\napproximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the\nempirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As\nwe will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.\n  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using\nfeedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback\ngranularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of\nregularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more\nsophisticated than regularized averaging.\n  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this\npattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the\nnumber of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance.

Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we\napply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in single-scale settings.

However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail\nto incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades\ndirectly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training\ndata for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through\ntwo main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse\nlongitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different\nurban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building\noutlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles\nthroughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are\naligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade\npatterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to\nlearn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of\nedge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and\nincorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of\nshade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,\ntime of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in\ngenerating shade images.

DVFL-Net\nutilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to\nsignificantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.\nWe employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal\nfocal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the\nVideo-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate\nDVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it\nagainst recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).\nAdditionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of\nforward KL divergence.
