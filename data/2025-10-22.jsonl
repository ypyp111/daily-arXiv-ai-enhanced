However,\npiezoelectric materials (e.g. Polyvinylidene Fluoride) can be anisotropic,\nwhich makes them challenging to model in three dimensions. This paper considers\nthe simpler problem of water wave scattering by an anisotropic elastic plate,\ni.e., the piezoelectric effect is ignored. The problem is obtained as an\nexpansion over the elastic plate modes. In turn, the component diffraction and\nradiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and\nsolving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to\nhighlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing\nscenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can\nbe forbidden due to symmetry. Although not considered in this paper, the method\nwe present is applicable to piezoelectric plates, and thereby facilitates the\nextension of piezoelectric wave energy converter models to the three\ndimensional water wave setting."}

The study is restricted to two-dimensional\nhorizontal perturbations. It is therefore independent of the vertical\n(traditional) Coriolis parameter. However, the flow has three velocity\ncomponents due to the horizontal (non-traditional) Coriolis parameter. Three\ndifferent scenarios of non-linear evolution of the shear instability are\nidentified, depending on the non-dimensional Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency $N$\nand the non-dimensional non-traditional Coriolis parameter $\\tilde{f}$\n(non-dimensionalized by the maximum shear), in the range $\\tilde{f}<N$ for\nfixed Reynolds and Schmidt numbers $Re=2000$, $Sc=1$. When the stratification\nis strong $N\\gg 1$, the shear instability generates stable Kelvin-Helmholtz\nbillows like in the traditional limit $\\tilde{f}=0$. Furthermore, when $N\\gg1$,\nthe governing equations for any $\\tilde{f}$ can be transformed into those for\n$\\tilde{f}=0$. This enables us to directly predict the characteristics of the\nflow depending on $\\tilde{f}$ and $N$. When $N$ is around unity and $\\tilde{f}$\nis above a threshold, the primary Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex is destabilised by\nsecondary instabilities but it remains coherent. For weaker stratification,\n$N\\leqslant0.5$ and $\\tilde{f}$ large enough, secondary instabilities develop\nvigorously and destroy the primary vortex into small-scales turbulence.\nConcomitantly, the enstrophy rises to high values by stretching/tilting as in\nfully three-dimensional flows. A local analysis of the flow prior to the onset\nof secondary instabilities reveals that the Fjortoft necessary condition for\ninstability is satisfied, suggesting that they correspond to shear\ninstabilities."}

This work answers the question of when and\nwhy TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian\ndistribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for\nfinite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis\nto Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the\nsampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.\nThe approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component\nmeans increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well\nseparated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update\nconverges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In\nsummary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has\nwell-separated modes and non-negligible variances.

The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a\nsparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features.

Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features).

Because\nculture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,\ncultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI.

Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was\napplied to these three features to create compact and informative feature\nvectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in\ndistinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an\naccuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the\nentropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and\nrobust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy\nunderscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of\nAlzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical\nresearch applications."}

In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented\nparadigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels\nfor single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by\nconstructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using\ntraining images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\nretrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It\nis important to recognize that using only training images without annotations\nexerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries.

Decoupling the vast majority of node updates\nfrom the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments\nshow that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while\nmaintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,\nprivacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,\nmanufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry."}

Key principles: (1) event as\nan act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models\n(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -\nthe order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)\nmaking the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring\ndeterminism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what\nfalls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the\ndeclarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of\nfixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms\n(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of\nhistory (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special\nattention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via\nschemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)\nwithout global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea\nsystem - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical\nconstructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language).

We operationalize belief depth as the extent\nto which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi\nestimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and\ndirect challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as\nmeasured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and\nmechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast,\nSynthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated\ndocuments consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that\nbehave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal,\nas implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and\nrepresentationally distinct from genuine knowledge.

Crop simulation models,\nwhich align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often\nperform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are\npowerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack\nadherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this\ngap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield\nis inherently defined by the water availability.

In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for\nmitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns\nof two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which\nstems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact\nwhen learning the target task.

In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead.

We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic\nframework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)\nreward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable\nintermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability\nmechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy\nupdates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before\ninfluencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme\nthat extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model\ndiversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on\nStable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human\npreference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally\nefficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without\ncompromising generative quality, diversity, or stability."}

Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning.

Beyond distillation, our method\ncan be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that\ninherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This\ncapability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation\nmethod (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion\nmodels, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost."}

Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of\ncounting rules.

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model.

When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness.

While\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the\nnuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward\nhacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust\nreinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable\npersonalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a\nPersonalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional\nscores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a\nCritique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs\nbased on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a\nrigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms\nstandard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an\naverage 11\\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses\nthe performance of GPT-4.1.

However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different\nnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments\nacross both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR\nsignificantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world\nbenchmarks."}

To address these, we pioneer three interconnected\ninnovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy\nmasking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;\n(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget\nby dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and\n(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic\nbottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training.

Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce\nsubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models."}
