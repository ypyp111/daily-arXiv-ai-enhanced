The PDE model is a nonlinear, coupled system of two\nequations in two variables (attractiveness of residential sites and density of\ncriminals), similar to the Keller-Segel model for aggregation based on\nchemotaxis. Unlike previous works, which applied periodic boundary conditions,\nwe enforce boundary conditions that arise naturally from the variational\nformulation of the PDE problem, i.e., the starting point for the application of\na finite element method.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome.

However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow\nimages that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or\ndevice-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where\nthe objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity\nfield, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed\nnoisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two\nsubproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem\nleverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field\nfrom noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims\nto infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping\nthat deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an\nalternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field\nand the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality\nreconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through\nexperiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under\nvarying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic\ngeometry with signal-dependent noise.

The\nframework correlates the temporal evolution of the surface-averaged Nusselt\nnumber with the dynamic behavior of Lagrangian saddle points, formed at the\nintersection of repelling and attracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs)\nextracted via Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields.The study is carried\nout within a precisely constructed observational domain, a previously\nunreported influential region in the near-wake, where the trajectory analysis\nof the newly defined key saddle points (active saddle points) consistently\naligns with the trends in surface heat transfer. This domain enables predictive\nidentification of key transitional events in the Nusselt number profile,\nincluding local extrema and slope inflections, across all inclination angles.\nThe analysis reveals that oblique displacement of active saddle points enhances\nheat transfer by promoting the shedding of repelling LCSs, while parallel\ndisplacement leads to weakened heat transfer due to the delayed detachment of\nrepelling coherent structures. The proposed framework enables the construction\nof a temporal function that closely replicates the monotonicity and\ntransitional features of the Nusselt number evolution.

Recently, researchers have explored the\neffectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful\nactions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely\noverlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid\nplans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with\nproblem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into\nmultiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize\nLLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where\nLLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and\nLLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.\nWe empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple\ndomains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving\nlarge-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs\neffectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where\ninfusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds\nparticular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge\nwithin LLMs."}

Although\nsignificant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques,\ncertain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable,\ngranular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases\nin LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines\npolarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated\nbalanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of\nsemantic categories.\n  As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the\nRussia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3,\nMistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with\na general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework\nallowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic\ncategories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation\nto prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and\ncitizenship modification.\n  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained\nbias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios\nand topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies."}

We formally axiomatize what it means to\nlearn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a\ncontinuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way.\nUnder additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of\nconfidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions.

They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared\non a model platform, such as HuggingFace.

While public pretrained T2I\nmodels facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new\nchallenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?\nModel selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known\nin (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target\ndomain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,\nwhich enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model\nplatform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The\ncore of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available\nmodels and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs\ncapturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We\nthen build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,\ncritically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,\npredicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target\ndomain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets\nagainst three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the\nbest model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model\nfor the rest."}

We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations.

In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly.

A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object\nmotion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in\nsimple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with\ninaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between\nobjects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing\ngeometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant\nobjects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address\nthis, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable\nspatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency\nTracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified\nspatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative\ntrajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our\ncue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature\nrepresentations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a\ndynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for\nstable online tracking.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the\neffectiveness of NoOp."}

Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models.

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We\nextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling\ninference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in\nClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises\neffectively to multiple latent diffusion models."}

However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks."}

The\ncore of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available\nmodels and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs\ncapturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We\nthen build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,\ncritically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,\npredicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target\ndomain.

However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow\nimages that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or\ndevice-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where\nthe objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity\nfield, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed\nnoisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two\nsubproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem\nleverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field\nfrom noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims\nto infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping\nthat deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an\nalternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field\nand the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality\nreconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through\nexperiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under\nvarying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic\ngeometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness\nand robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to\nassess the influence of key hyperparameters."}

This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored\nchallenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency\nfor adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training\nframework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the\ntemporal transferability of adversarial perturbations.

Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in\nrobust-accuracy trade-off.
