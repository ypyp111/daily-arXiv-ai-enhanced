A systematic investigation is carried out to explore\nthe influence of polyacrylamide (PAM) concentration, surface tension, velocity\nratios, and contact angle on the gas slug length, volume, unit cell length, and\npressure drop. Three different concentrations of PAM solutions, which exhibit\nshear-thinning behaviour are considered as the continuous phase. Gas slug\nlength, volume, and unit cell length decreased with increasing the PAM\nconcentration. Velocity and non-homogeneous viscosity distributions in the\nliquid slug for three different PAM concentration solutions are reported. Gas\nslug length decreases with an increase of the contact angle and the bubble\nshape change from convex to concave.

The flow inside the wavy channel with a porous substrate is governed by\nthe Darcy-Brinkman equation. We used the perturbation approach to ascertain the\nsolution to the problem, assuming that the ratio between the channel width and\nthe wavelength is very small (i.e., $\\delta^2 \\ll 1$). We solved the problem up\nto $O(\\delta^2)$ by assuming $\\lambda^2 \\delta^2 \\ll 1$, where $\\lambda$ is the\nratio of anisotropic permeability. Our primary objective is to investigate how\nthe anisotropic permeability ratio influences flow reversal near the crest and\ntrough of a wavy wall under both steady flow conditions and when a pulsatile\ncomponent is superimposed on the steady flow. In the case of steady flow, flow\nseparation occurs near the crest region of the wavy wall, leading to the\nformation of recirculating zones where fluid becomes trapped. In contrast, for\npulsatile flow as well as combined effects of steady and pulsatile flow,\nvortices form transiently at certain phases of the pulsation cycle.\nSubsequently, these vortices bulge into the mainstream, resulting in a complete\nbackflow. We explored the approximate flow reversal zone using Darcy's\napproximation theory far from the wavy wall. The flow recirculation associated\nwith steady flow is critical for mass transport and enhances convective mixing.\nOn the other hand, flow reversal at different time instances can optimize\noxygen transfer in devices such as membrane oxygenators."}

In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights.

Plan Quality checks whether an\nagent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's\nactions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's\nfinal outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two\nbenchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for\na production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a\nsystematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent\nerrors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that\nexhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%\nerrors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted\nimprovement of agent performance."}

MLMC theory optimizes the total computational\ncost for estimating a functional to within a target accuracy. The proposed MLHT\nalgorithms are based on the quasidiffusion (Variable Eddington Factor) and\nsecond-moment methods. For these methods, the low-order equations for the\nangular moments of the high-order transport solution are discretized in space.\nMonte Carlo techniques compute the closures for the low-order equations; then,\nthe equations are solved, yielding a single realization of the global flux\nsolution. The ensemble average of the realizations yields the level solution.\nThe results for 1-D slab transport problems demonstrates weak convergence of\nthe functionals considered.

There are two main problems in the\ntask of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,\nexisting methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in\ncomplex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise\nrelationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in\nthe network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise\nrelationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy\nand data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification\nmethod for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to\naddress the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with\npairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the\nhigher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the\naccuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction\nmodule for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced\nto transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic\nevolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the\nphysical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure\nthat the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive\ndynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the\nprediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain\nnetwork datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper\nhas good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance."}

Yet, deep neural networks\n(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly\nwell, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To\nexplore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to\nidentify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.\nConsistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference\nin component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying\ncomponents selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral\nstream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral\nstream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building\non this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for\nmeasuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better\ncaptures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we\nfind that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either\ndorsal or lateral representations.

This limitation becomes particularly critical\nwhen generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often\noccupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct\nthese regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical\ndecision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training\nframework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating\nlesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it\nnot only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of\nlesion delineation.

To tighten this\ngap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that\nscales only with the size of the value-function class.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention.

However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or\nspurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective\nthat encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal\ncomputations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.\nIn this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process\nfactual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their\nreliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are\nassociated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process\nas for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable\nhidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject\nknowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them\ndetectable.

Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.\nNext, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt\nFine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a\nteacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the\n\"overthinking\" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively\ninjects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its\nreasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed\nstrategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Recent\nwork has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits\nwithout severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.\nHowever, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.\n  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses\nsupervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.\nIn Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability\nthreshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact\nsubsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation\nand implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an\noptimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based\nrescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on\nCommunication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on\ngeneral benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over\n40%.

Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we\ndemonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to\nexisting methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent\nreconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution\nfor learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a\nfoundation for more reliable model analysis."}

We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove\nthe main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent\nin the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral\ncomponents, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit\ncount. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning\nthe exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive\nphysical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous\ntheoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive\nparameter adjustment."}

This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,\nmulti-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its\nresponse as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We\nintroduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that\nenables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights\ndirectly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters\non-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each\ndiffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables\nthe model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying\nconditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through\nexperiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,\nparametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to\nspatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods.

PlatformX\nintegrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands\nconventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,\nenabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable\nkernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with\nminimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search\nalgorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and\n(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device\npower measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We\nevaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it\nsignificantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy\nfidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ\nper inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency.

Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any\nexplicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal\nAlignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that\nbaselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform\nparameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.\nWe hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in\nmulti-modal research."}

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential\nprivacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models\nprivate sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is\nrepresented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally\noptimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it\nconsistently outperforms global minimax samplers."}

Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance\nsafety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral\ncontrol from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with\nminimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of\nmodels show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially\nlowers false refusal rates.

To address this challenge, we propose MODE\n(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural\ngating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable\ncomponents, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and\naccurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because\nagents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is\nespecially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our\nmethod on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.\nFirst, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task\nusing synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample\nsettings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks\nwhich simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we\ndeploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it\ncan not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also\npredict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding\nchallenge in computational biology."}

LatentBreak substitutes words\nin the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial\nintent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or\nlong templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent\nspace between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless\nrequests.

This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient\ninference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning\nensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved\neven with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed\nmethodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of\nhybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural\nreasoning systems."}

We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and\nimage modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining\ntheir influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we\npropose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of\ntextual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant\ndimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in\ntest-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance\nthe reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios."}

This paper addresses the problem of producing a\nvirtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style\nand shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,\nthus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related\ndomains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning\ntechnique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core\nchallenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and\nthe few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a\nmulti-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual\ncharacters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization\nset and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our\napproach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned\nstyle. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it\nto relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation\nstudy. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse\ncharacters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference\ncharacters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and\nhighlighting the potential of our method."}

Yet, current coding benchmarks face\nlimitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient\ntest case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.\nTo address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfeaturing 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,\neach with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced\ndirectly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted\nbetween 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key\nfeatures: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask\nrubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite\ncontestant performance data to enable informative comparison against\ntop-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from\nnewly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system\nfacilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular\ngeneral-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable\n81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human\ncontestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among\nopen-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,\nunderscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.\nDetailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise\nproblem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should\nemphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration.

In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains."}
