### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO是首个基于视频一致性模型的零样本视频恢复求解器，通过利用VCMs的时序因果性，在保持测量一致性和时间平滑性的同时，显著提升了高分辨率视频重建的质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像LDM的方法在逐帧处理视频时会导致时间不一致性，而直接扩展视频LDM又面临计算复杂度的挑战。需要一种既能保持时间一致性又高效的视频恢复方法。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)作为先验，提出零样本求解器LVTINO，通过绕过自动微分的条件机制，仅需少量神经网络评估即可实现高质量视频重建。

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上的实验表明，LVTINO在重建保真度和计算效率方面均优于当前最先进的逐帧图像LDM方法，实现了显著的感知质量提升。

Conclusion: LVTINO通过VCMs有效解决了视频恢复中的时间一致性问题，为高分辨率视频逆问题建立了新的性能基准，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于风格提取的三阶段训练图像生成方法，通过风格编码器和投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐，实现细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中细粒度风格难以用自然语言精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的引导信息难以与文本条件直接对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用风格编码器和风格投影层从单一风格参考图像中提取细粒度风格表示，并将其注入到预训练生成模型中，不改变下游生成模型的结构框架。构建了包含图像、风格标签和文本描述三元组的Style30k-captions数据集进行训练。

Result: 实现了基于文本提示的细粒度风格引导生成，能够精确控制生成图像的风格特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够最大化预训练生成模型的生成能力，通过风格表示与文本表示的对齐，实现了细粒度可控的风格化图像生成。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于识别技能学习过程中挣扎行为的数据集EvoStruggle，包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频和5,385个标注的时间段，涵盖四种活动类型。研究将挣扎识别定义为时间动作定位任务，实验表明TAL模型能够成功检测挣扎线索，并在未见过的任务和活动中展现出一定的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操纵数据集未关注挣扎行为随时间的演变，而理解这种演变对于确定用户当前学习阶段和开发有效的辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 收集包含76名参与者的数据集，涵盖18个任务（分为打结、折纸、七巧板、洗牌四种活动），每个任务重复五次以捕捉技能演变。将挣扎识别定义为时间动作定位任务，使用TAL模型进行检测。

Result: Temporal Action Localization模型能够成功学习检测挣扎线索，在跨任务泛化时达到34.56%的平均mAP，在跨活动泛化时达到19.24%的平均mAP，表明挣扎是一个可跨任务转移的概念。

Conclusion: 挣扎检测是一个具有挑战性但可行的任务，模型在未见任务和活动中展现出一定的泛化能力，为优化人类学习和开发辅助系统提供了基础。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at
https://github.com/FELIXFENG2019/EvoStruggle.

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的偏微分方程求解基础模型，使用轻量级残差U-Net架构，通过自回归预训练策略学习物理规律，在多种下游PDE任务上实现最先进的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂Transformer架构，计算和参数开销大。SPUS旨在探索轻量级U-Net架构作为基础模型的潜力，提供参数效率更高的解决方案。

Method: 采用轻量级残差U-Net架构，使用自回归预训练策略模拟数值求解器行为，在多样化流体动力学PDE数据集上进行预训练。

Result: 在6个未见下游PDE任务上实现最先进的泛化性能，同时需要显著更少的参数和微调数据，展示了作为参数高效基础模型的潜力。

Conclusion: SPUS证明了轻量级U-Net架构作为PDE求解基础模型的有效性，为开发参数效率更高的统一神经算子提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过多样性约束直接优化多人生成中的身份多样性，解决了文本到图像模型在多人提示下重复面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型在真实性方面表现出色，但在多人提示下表现不佳，会出现重复面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题。

Method: DisCo通过Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)微调流匹配模型，使用组合奖励函数：(i)惩罚图像内面部相似性，(ii)阻止跨样本身份重复，(iii)确保准确的人数计数，(iv)通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。采用单阶段课程学习来稳定训练。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo实现了98.6%的独特面孔准确率和接近完美的全局身份分布，超越了开源和专有方法（如Gemini、GPT-Image），同时保持了竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo是一个可扩展、无需额外标注的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机问题，并为组合式多人生成设立了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐，并构建层次化的地理嵌入来表示世界，同时融合外观特征和语义分割图来形成鲁棒的视觉表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球视觉地理定位旨在仅使用图像视觉内容确定其在地球上的地理位置。尽管已有进展，但学习用于视觉地理定位的地理表示仍然是一个活跃的研究课题。

Method: 将地理定位问题表述为对齐查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示。提出新颖的地理表示方法，将世界建模为层次化的地理嵌入。同时引入一种有效的方法，融合查询图像的外观特征和语义分割图，形成鲁棒的视觉表示。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的25个指标中，有22个指标达到了新的最佳性能，超越了先前的最先进方法和近期的大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 消融研究支持这些性能提升主要归功于地理表示和视觉表示的结合。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了XMAS方法，通过聚类基于注意力矩阵轨迹的样本来高效选择LVLM指令调优数据，能在保留性能的同时大幅减少训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大型视觉语言模型的数据选择上表现不佳，无法超越随机选择，需要开发更有效的数据高效学习方法。

Method: 基于跨模态注意力矩阵相似性理论，通过聚类注意力矩阵的奇异值轨迹，从簇中平衡采样来消除数据冗余。

Result: XMAS能去除LLaVA-665k数据集的50%和Vision-Flan数据集的85%，完全保留LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准上的性能，训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: XMAS是首个有效的LVLM数据高效指令调优方法，显著优于现有基线，实现了更好的数据缩减效果。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

### [8] [Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478)
*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于矢量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，结合了连续传输动力学和显式分类监督，在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务中实现了更快的训练收敛和竞争力的FID分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的连续流匹配方法缺乏明确的分类监督，而离散流匹配方法则缺乏几何感知能力。Purrception旨在结合连续方法的几何感知和离散方法的分类监督优势。

Method: 通过将变分流匹配适配到矢量量化潜在空间，在连续嵌入空间中计算速度场的同时学习码本索引的分类后验分布。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务中，训练收敛速度比连续流匹配和离散流匹配基线更快，同时达到与最先进模型竞争的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配能够有效桥接连续传输和离散监督，提高图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的深度学习框架，通过条件扩散模型和多任务学习，从非对比CT扫描中生成合成对比增强CT图像，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，解决了传统多阶段方法的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强CT检查需要碘对比剂，存在肾毒性、过敏反应和环境危害等风险。现有的深度学习方法采用多阶段流程，导致误差累积且无法共享语义和解剖结构。

Method: 集成条件扩散模型与多任务学习的统一框架，共享编码器和解码器参数，采用半监督训练策略处理缺失分割标签的临床数据，实现端到端的图像合成和分割联合优化。

Result: 在264名患者队列中表现优异：图像合成PSNR达25.61 dB，优于单任务CDM的23.80 dB；分割方面，腔Dice分数提升至0.89，血栓Dice分数提升至0.53；临床测量更准确，腔直径MAE降至4.19 mm，血栓面积误差降至33.85%。

Conclusion: 该统一框架在减少对比剂使用的同时，通过联合优化图像合成和分割任务，显著提升了腹部主动脉瘤评估的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

### [10] [From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513)
*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多模态内容分析的高效原型框架，将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式，并进一步转化为可查询的知识图谱表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析通常计算成本高且工程复杂，现有预训练模型难以直接应用于复杂数据（如视频）的融合分析。

Method: 设计候选流水线，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时间半结构化数据，再转化为帧级索引知识图谱，支持查询和持续学习。

Result: 开发了一个支持动态融入新领域知识的交互式多模态分析框架。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效简化多模态内容分析流程，支持持续学习和知识扩展。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT框架通过逆向工程将网站功能转化为可重用的工具，让智能体调用高级操作而非执行低级UI交互，在浏览器自动化任务中实现了更高的成功率和更少的步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络智能体方法依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理，在动态布局和长任务中表现脆弱。相比之下，人类通过搜索、筛选、排序等高级操作利用网站功能。

Method: WALT逆向工程网站潜在功能，将其转化为可调用工具，涵盖发现（搜索、筛选、排序）、通信（发布、评论、点赞）和内容管理（创建、编辑、删除）等功能。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena上，WALT实现了更高的成功率、更少的步骤和更少的LLM依赖推理。

Conclusion: WALT建立了一个稳健且可推广的浏览器自动化范式，将计算负担从脆弱的逐步推理转移到可靠的工具调用。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于半监督分割的拓扑一致性框架，通过整合多个扰动预测来保持有意义的语义结构，特别适用于密集分布的病理图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从未标记数据中捕捉有意义的语义结构至关重要，这在对象密集分布的病理图像分析中尤其具有挑战性。

Method: 利用通过随机dropout和时间训练快照获得的多个扰动预测，强制这些不同输出之间的拓扑一致性，并引入结合空间重叠和全局结构对齐的新型匹配策略。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法有效减少了拓扑错误，产生了更鲁棒和准确的分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过拓扑一致性机制能够区分生物学有意义的结构与瞬态噪声伪影，为可靠的下游分析提供了基础。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Diffusion-LPO框架，通过列表偏好优化来改进文本到图像扩散模型的对齐效果，相比成对偏好方法能更好地利用人类反馈中的排序信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法主要依赖成对偏好，但人类对图像的偏好反馈通常包含隐式的排序信息，这些信息比成对比较更能准确反映人类偏好。

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce模型推导了DPO目标的列表扩展，给定一个标题，将用户反馈聚合成图像排名列表，通过鼓励每个样本优于其所有低排名替代品来确保整个排名的一致性。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO在视觉质量和偏好对齐方面始终优于成对DPO基线。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO是一个简单有效的框架，能够更好地利用列表偏好数据来优化扩散模型，提升与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合CNN和贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于小数据集的口腔癌分类，通过不确定性量化提高模型可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决口腔癌早期诊断中传统深度学习模型过度自信、泛化能力差的问题，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络与贝叶斯深度学习结合的混合模型，采用变分推理进行不确定性量化，在智能手机拍摄的彩色图像上进行训练。

Result: 在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，在真实世界照片数据上达到88%准确率（传统CNN为72.94%），且能正确识别高不确定性样本。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境下能有效提高口腔癌早期诊断的模型可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Method: 构建辅助域模块从中间聚合全局注意力获得多样化表示；基于辅助域和目标域，通过多重一致性策略获取不变特征表示；使用条件多核最大均值差异策略对齐困难样本到对应的简单样本。

Conclusion: CADTrans通过构建域一致性的不变特征表示，有效解决了无源域自适应中的困难样本和域偏差问题，在多个基准测试中取得了显著性能改进。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个系统，利用BLV用户的历史问题来指导多模态大语言模型生成更相关的图像描述，而不是默认的冗长描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM应用通常提供全面但冗长的描述，缺乏上下文相关性，导致BLV用户需要筛选大量无关信息才能获得所需内容。

Method: 系统从VizWiz-LF数据集中识别相似的视觉上下文，使用相关历史问题来指导MLLM生成更符合BLV用户需求的描述。

Result: 评估显示，76.1%的情境感知描述能够预判并回答用户问题，在54.4%的比较中被优先选择。

Conclusion: 利用BLV用户的历史视觉问题可以显著提高MLLM生成描述的上下文相关性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of
VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable
the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader
understanding of multimodal reasoning mechanisms. The dataset and evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法NPN，通过神经网络在感知矩阵零空间的低维投影中寻找解，而不是在图像域施加约束，提高了反问题的重建质量。


<details>

Motivation: 传统反问题求解方法通常忽略感知矩阵零空间的特定结构，而零空间包含了感知过程无法获取的信息。NPN旨在利用零空间的结构特性来改进重建效果。

Method: 使用神经网络学习感知矩阵零空间的低维投影，通过促进解位于该投影空间来实现正则化。该方法与现有重建框架兼容，可作为补充正则化器。

Result: 在压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨率、CT和MRI等多种成像反问题中，NPN先验能持续提升重建保真度，适用于plug-and-play方法、展开网络、深度图像先验和扩散模型。

Conclusion: NPN提供了一种可解释且灵活的正则化方法，通过关注零空间结构来改进成像反问题的重建质量，具有理论保证和广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该工作为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化建立了可靠基础，能够平衡准确性、校准和临床效用。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型缺乏显式的逐步推理，直接输出最终动作而不考虑可操作性约束或几何关系，后训练流程也很少强化推理质量。

Method: 提出RLVR后训练策略，包含区域对齐、轨迹一致性和输出格式的可验证奖励；开发VLA-CoT-13K高质量数据集，提供与可操作性和轨迹标注明确对齐的思维链监督。

Result: 在领域内、领域外、仿真和真实机器人平台上的广泛评估表明，VLA-R1相比先前VLA方法实现了更优的泛化和真实世界性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过系统优化推理和执行能力，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化能力和真实世界应用效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合去模糊和3D重建的方法，用于解决微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，通过可微分渲染自监督优化3D模型和模糊核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影具有高分辨率和大放大倍率的优势，但散焦模糊严重阻碍了清晰成像和高质量3D重建。传统方法需要大量图像和标注，且目前没有针对微距摄影的多视角3D重建方法。

Method: 从多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微分渲染方法来自监督优化3D模型和模糊核。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量多视角图像中，该方法不仅能实现高质量图像去模糊，还能恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，实现了联合去模糊和3D重建，为小细节物体的高质量3D建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Conclusion: FideDiff为预训练扩散模型在高保真图像恢复任务中的应用提供了新方向，为工业应用中的扩散模型建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青铜器铭文是早期中国文字的重要阶段，但自动识别面临严重视觉退化、多域变异（照片、拓片、摹本）和极长尾字符分布的挑战。

Method: 构建包含22454张全页图像和198598个标注字符的大规模数据集，开发两阶段检测-识别流程，使用LadderMoE增强CLIP编码器，实现动态专家专业化和更强鲁棒性。

Result: 在单字符和全页识别任务上大幅超越现有场景文本识别基线，在头部、中部和尾部类别以及所有采集模态上都实现了优越的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirDA是一种参数高效的领域自适应方法，通过视觉重编程层生成视觉提示来调整输入图像的纹理风格，无需微调主干网络参数，显著减少了可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的UDA方法需要为每个新的源-目标对微调主干网络参数，导致训练参数和存储内存线性增长，且无法重用训练好的主干参数。

Method: 在主干网络前添加领域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为纹理偏置，通过优化域内和域间分布差异来训练这些层，保持主干参数不变。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上达到92.8%的平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数，优于参数高效的PDA基线方法，且仅需全参数微调方法1.7%-2.8%的参数。

Conclusion: VirDA实现了参数高效的领域自适应，通过视觉重编程重用主干网络，在保持竞争力的性能同时大幅减少参数需求。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: 现有面部表情编码系统如FACS覆盖范围有限且标注成本高，需要一种更精确、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 使用3DMM提取身份不变的表情特征，通过RVQ-VAE编码为离散标记序列，每个标记捕获特定的可重用面部变形模式。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Motivation: 现有的非刚性结构恢复方法依赖严格假设（如局部平面表面或局部线性变形），无法恢复共形尺度，限制了重建精度。

Method: 使用基于图的框架优化2D图像扭曲，采用并行可分离迭代优化策略，并结合自监督学习框架生成带纹理的密集3D点云。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse是一个统一的鲁棒重建框架，通过将不一致的多视角图像转换为视频，使用视频扩散模型恢复一致性，然后重建3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从不一致多视角图像进行3D重建的挑战，现有方法依赖密集观测且优化复杂，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 将鲁棒重建分解为恢复和重建两个子任务：先将不一致图像转换为初始视频，使用专门设计的视频扩散模型恢复一致性，然后从恢复的图像重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有强大的泛化能力和优越的鲁棒重建性能，并能控制重建3D场景的风格。

Conclusion: UniVerse通过解耦恢复和重建任务，利用扩散模型学习的大规模场景先验，有效处理多样化的图像不一致问题，实现了优异的3D重建效果。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级端到端模板匹配框架，将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归问题，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立缩放比例，在复杂背景下实现高效的目标位置和几何状态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖角度和尺度的穷举枚举，效率低下；大多数深度学习方法只估计相似度得分而不显式建模几何姿态，不适合实际部署。需要克服这些限制，实现高效、精确的模板匹配。

Method: 使用Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM)动态注入模板特征，整合深度可分离卷积和像素洗牌实现高效匹配；采用旋转-剪切增强策略和结构感知伪标签实现无几何标注训练；通过轻量级细化模块进行局部优化提升精度。

Result: 3.07M参数的模型在复合变换下实现高精度和14ms推理时间，在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强鲁棒性，适合实时工业应用部署。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在模板匹配任务中实现了高效、精确的几何姿态估计，为实时工业应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is
available at:https://github.com/ZhouJ6610/PoseMatch-TDCM.

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个自适应像素推理框架，让视觉语言模型能根据查询难度动态决定是否需要像素级操作，在提升性能的同时显著减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理需要精细视觉元素理解的任务时表现不佳，主要因为图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。虽然引入像素级信息有帮助，但往往被过度使用，导致效率低下和无关视觉细节的干扰。

Method: 首先通过操作感知的监督微调建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计新颖的rollout引导的强化学习框架，依靠模型自身响应的反馈来动态决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型实现了优越性能同时显著减少不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上达到73.4%准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比之前方法在提升准确率的同时减少了66.5%的工具使用。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应像素推理框架有效解决了像素级信息过度使用的问题，实现了性能提升与效率优化的平衡，为视觉语言模型的精细推理能力提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了基于增强敏感性的风险评分框架ASRS，用于识别易出错的胸部X光片病例，通过测量图像旋转后的嵌入变化来评估模型稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片解读中性能良好，但在患者亚组间存在准确性不均的问题，现有错误检测方法难以处理分布内的细微错误。

Method: 应用临床合理的旋转（±15°/±30°），使用RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化，通过敏感性评分将样本分层到稳定性四分位数。

Result: 高敏感性病例的召回率显著降低（-0.2至-0.3），尽管AUROC和置信度较高，ASRS提供了无需标签的选择性预测方法。

Conclusion: ASRS框架为选择性预测和临床医生审查提供了无标签手段，提高了医学AI的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

TL;DR: FreeViS是一个无需训练的视频风格化框架，通过整合多个风格化参考到预训练的图转视频模型，实现高质量、时间一致性的视频风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频风格化方法存在时间一致性差、风格丰富度低的问题，而训练专用模型需要配对视频数据且计算成本高。

Method: 整合多个风格化参考到预训练I2V模型，使用高频补偿约束内容布局和运动，结合基于光流的运动线索保留低显著性区域的风格纹理。

Result: FreeViS在风格化保真度和时间一致性方面优于现有基线方法，获得强烈的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 该无需训练的流程为高质量、时间一致性的视频风格化提供了实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

TL;DR: 提出了MedQ-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在医学图像质量评估中的感知和推理能力，包含2600个感知查询和708个推理评估，涵盖5种成像模态和40多个质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量评分指标，无法反映专家评估中的人类推理过程，需要建立更符合人类推理的评估范式。

Method: 设计了MedQ-Perception（低层感知能力评估）和MedQ-Reasoning（无参考和比较推理任务）两个互补任务，采用多维判断协议评估模型输出，并与放射科医生进行人机对齐验证。

Result: 评估了14个最先进的MLLMs，发现模型表现出初步但不稳定的感知和推理能力，准确性不足以可靠临床使用。

Conclusion: MLLMs在医学图像质量评估方面需要针对性优化，MedQ-Bench将推动该领域的进一步探索和发展。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

TL;DR: InstaFormer是一个能够通过单次前向传播从RGB图像中预测完整遮挡和深度顺序的网络，无需昂贵的输入格式和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在受控环境中理解实例级几何关系对视觉模型具有挑战性，现有方法需要昂贵的输入格式（类别标签、二值分割掩码）和推理成本（二次方前向传播次数）。

Method: InstaFormer通过对象查询和潜在掩码描述符之间的交互实现整体顺序预测，这些描述符语义上表示相同对象但携带互补信息。

Result: 该方法在综合基准测试和消融实验中显示出有效性。

Conclusion: InstaFormer通过单次前向传播解决了实例级几何关系预测的问题，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PyramidStyler是一个基于Transformer的神经风格迁移框架，通过金字塔位置编码和强化学习优化，实现了高效的高分辨率图像风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在处理复杂风格和高分辨率输入时存在效率问题，需要更高效的风格迁移方法。

Method: 提出PyramidStyler框架，采用金字塔位置编码(PPE)来捕捉局部细节和全局上下文，并结合强化学习动态优化风格化过程。

Result: 在COCO和WikiArt数据集上训练4000轮后，内容损失降低62.6%至2.07，风格损失降低57.4%至0.86，推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后进一步改善至内容损失2.03，风格损失0.75，推理时间1.40秒。

Conclusion: PyramidStyler实现了实时高质量的艺术渲染，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoBE-GS是一个负载均衡的高效3D高斯泼溅框架，通过深度感知分区和优化策略解决了大规模场景重建中的负载不平衡问题，将预处理时间从小时级降至分钟级，训练速度比现有方法快2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分治方法在扩展到大型无边界场景时存在两个瓶颈：(i)分区负载严重不平衡，均匀或启发式分割无法反映实际计算需求；(ii)粗到细流水线未能有效利用粗阶段，经常重新加载整个模型并产生高开销。

Method: 引入深度感知分区方法减少预处理时间；采用基于优化的策略平衡可见高斯分布；使用可见性裁剪和选择性致密化两种轻量级技术进一步降低训练成本。

Result: 在大规模城市和户外数据集上的评估显示，LoBE-GS比最先进基线方法实现高达2倍的端到端训练加速，同时保持重建质量，并能扩展到传统3DGS无法处理的场景。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS通过重新设计大规模3DGS流水线，有效解决了负载不平衡和效率问题，为大规模无边界场景的实时高保真重建提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

TL;DR: 提出了MemoryPack和Direct Forcing两种方法来解决长视频生成中的长期依赖建模和错误累积问题，提升自回归视频模型的实际可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临双重挑战：需要捕捉长期依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中固有的错误累积。

Method: 1. MemoryPack：可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖；2. Direct Forcing：高效的单步近似策略，改善训练-推理对齐以减少推理时的错误传播。

Result: 实现了分钟级的时间一致性，计算复杂度保持线性，计算效率得到保持，显著提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing的组合显著增强了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性，推进了自回归视频模型的实际应用。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自主系统中，精确的物体检测和不确定性估计对于自感知和安全操作至关重要。需要关注所有类别的完整预测置信度分布的校准，而不仅仅是主导类别。

Method: 提出了两种辅助正则化损失项：一种是校准主导预测，另一种是校准完整预测向量。评估了多种后处理和训练时方法，包括等渗回归。

Result: 结合完整类别预测校准损失项和等渗回归的方法在CenterPoint和PillarNet上取得了最佳校准效果，但DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主导和次要预测。

Conclusion: 完整预测向量校准损失与等渗回归的组合对某些3D检测器有效，但不同检测器需要不同的校准策略。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Motivation: 现有人员搜索方法使用ImageNet预训练骨干网络可能无法有效捕捉复杂空间上下文和细粒度身份线索，且共享骨干网络特征会导致检测和重识别任务的优化目标冲突。

Method: 提出DiffPS框架，包含三个专门模块：扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)用于改进人员定位，多尺度频率精炼网络(MSFRN)减轻形状偏差，语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 扩散先验知识能有效解决人员搜索中检测和重识别任务的优化冲突问题，提出的DiffPS框架显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

TL;DR: 提出了FMU网络，首次将流匹配集成到HSI重建中，通过深度展开框架嵌入生成先验，引入平均速度损失增强流一致性，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像成本高且重建困难，压缩感知系统如CASSI存在严重退化问题，导致精细光谱细节丢失，需要更准确的重建方法。

Method: 结合流匹配和深度展开框架，嵌入生成先验，引入平均速度损失来增强流的全局一致性，融合基于优化的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，FMU在重建质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU成功地将流匹配集成到HSI重建中，通过混合设计实现了更鲁棒和准确的重建性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean

robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

*Wei-Lung Mao,Chun-Chi Wang,Po-Heng Chou,Yen-Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的双列直插封装(DIP)自动缺陷检测系统，使用ConSinGAN生成训练数据，YOLOv7模型在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件缺陷检测耗时耗力，给质检人员带来沉重负担且难以管理产品质量。

Method: 使用数字相机光学系统和深度学习模型，采用ConSinGAN生成合适大小的数据集，比较了YOLOv3、v4、v7、v9四种模型。

Result: YOLOv7结合ConSinGAN在准确率达到95.50%，检测时间为285毫秒，远优于基于阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动缺陷检测系统可轻松应用于多种缺陷类型或缺陷数据不足的情况，并开发了SCADA系统和相关传感器架构。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FoundAD方法，利用基础视觉编码器的大规模预训练能力，通过非线性投影算子检测图像中的异常区域，在少样本异常检测中实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本异常检测在工业安全检查中很重要，但有限样本使得正常和异常特征难以区分，特别是在类别无关条件下。基础视觉编码器的大规模预训练有助于学习正常图像的一般分布。

Method: 观察到图像中的异常量与学习嵌入的差异直接相关，设计非线性投影算子将图像投影到自然图像流形上，该算子作为异常检测的有效工具来表征和识别图像中的分布外区域。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法支持多类检测，在使用比先前方法少得多的参数的同时实现竞争性性能，并通过多个基础编码器（包括DINOv3）的评估验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法拓宽了基础特征的应用视角，推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

TL;DR: ClustViT通过可训练的聚类模块和再生器模块，在保持分割精度的同时显著降低了Vision Transformer的计算复杂度，实现了更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然精度高、泛化能力强，但其二次方注意力复杂度限制了在真实世界机器人系统中的应用。现有的token合并方法适用于分类任务，但不适合密集预测任务如语义分割。

Method: 在Vision Transformer骨干网络基础上，引入可训练的聚类模块根据分割掩码的伪聚类指导合并相似token，然后通过再生器模块恢复细节信息供下游头使用。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上实现了高达2.18倍的GFLOPs减少和1.64倍的推理加速，同时保持了可比较的分割精度。

Conclusion: ClustViT通过智能token合并和细节恢复机制，有效解决了ViT在密集预测任务中的计算效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT是一种统一的多模态大语言模型范式，通过视觉参考令牌直接生成文本和视觉输出，解决了现有方法依赖间接表示的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中依赖间接表示（如将坐标生成为文本），这限制了性能并阻碍了密集预测任务如分割。

Method: 提出Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT)范式，使用视觉参考令牌(VRTs)与文本令牌交织，通过轻量级解码器转换为检测、分割和定位预测。

Result: 在四个视觉感知和理解任务中，PaDT始终达到最先进的性能，甚至优于显著更大的MLLM模型。

Conclusion: PaDT提供了一种有效的统一范式，使MLLM能够直接生成多样化的视觉输出，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: 该研究针对生鲜电商中的信任赤字问题，提出了'信任金字塔'模型和'三角信任指数'，并设计了可解释AI框架TriAlignXA，通过多目标优化解决农产品分级中的'不可能三角'问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线水果蔬菜电商存在'信任赤字'，因为数字交易无法提供对产品质量的直接感官感知，这阻碍了电商平台的发展。

Method: 构建'信任金字塔'模型，提出'三角信任指数'量化分级权衡，设计可解释AI框架TriAlignXA，包含生物自适应引擎、时效优化引擎和经济优化引擎，并采用'预映射机制'将过程数据编码为二维码。

Result: 在分级任务实验中，相比基线模型获得显著更高的准确率，实证和理论分析验证了框架在解决'不可能三角'方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可信赖的在线农产品生态系统提供了从理论到实践的全面支持，建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: 4DGS-Craft是一个用于4D高斯溅射编辑的一致性和交互式框架，通过4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块和高斯选择机制解决视图、时间和非编辑区域一致性问题，并利用LLM模块理解用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯溅射编辑方法在视图一致性、时间一致性、非编辑区域保持以及处理复杂文本指令方面面临挑战，需要开发更一致和可控的编辑框架。

Method: 提出4D感知InstructPix2Pix模型，整合4D VGGT几何特征；使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入图像；设计高斯选择机制仅优化编辑区域的高斯；采用基于LLM的用户意图理解模块分解复杂指令。

Result: 相比相关工作，该方法实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，能够处理复杂的用户指令并保持编辑质量。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft框架有效解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的一致性和交互性问题，为复杂4D场景编辑提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法如CAMixer存在适应性差、掩码粒度粗和空间灵活性不足等问题，需要更精细的像素级计算优化。

Method: 使用Pure-Pass像素级掩码机制，基于固定颜色中心点将像素分类，识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，集成到ATD-light模型中。

Result: PP-ATD-light在重建质量和参数效率上优于CAMixer-ATD-light，在节省相似计算量的情况下实现更优性能。

Conclusion: Pure-Pass机制通过精细的像素级掩码实现了高效超分辨率重建，在保持自适应灵活性的同时显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4o多模态能力自动生成颌骨囊肿的影像学发现，通过自校正循环结构化输出框架提高准确性，在牙齿编号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收等项目上显著改善输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在自动生成颌骨囊肿影像学发现时存在准确性问题，需要开发更可靠的结构化输出框架来减少幻觉并提高一致性。

Method: 构建自校正循环结构化输出(SLSO)框架，包含10步处理流程：图像输入分析、结构化数据生成、牙齿编号提取和一致性检查、检测到不一致时的迭代再生、发现生成及后续重构和一致性验证。

Result: 与传统的思维链方法相比，SLSO框架在多个评估项目上提高了输出准确性，牙齿编号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收的改善率分别为66.9%、33.3%和28.6%。成功案例中经过最多5次再生后实现了结构一致的输出。

Conclusion: SLSO框架能够强制执行阴性发现描述、抑制幻觉并提高牙齿编号识别准确性，但识别跨越多个牙齿的广泛病变仍有限制，需要进一步改进以实现实用的发现生成系统。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Result: 模型在保持性能的同时提高了重建质量，成功重建了与原始交通环境无关的物体，展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LiLa-Net通过平衡跳跃连接和潜在编码的信息，实现了高效的点云重建，且具有良好的泛化性能，为3D点云处理提供了资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original

Conclusion: kabr-tools通过规模化自动行为监测，为生态系统研究、保护和生态监测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖点云或需要预定义同胚映射来处理无纹理数据，这些方法存在局限性。本文旨在克服这些限制，实现高质量的3D形状和纹理形变。

Method: 采用网格引导的3D高斯溅射(3DGS)进行高保真建模，核心是统一变形策略，将3D高斯锚定到重建的网格面片上，通过拓扑感知约束确保几何一致性和纹理保真度，同时利用网格拓扑作为几何先验建立无监督语义对应。

Result: 在提出的TexMorph基准测试中，GaussianMorphing显著优于先前的2D/3D方法，将颜色一致性误差(ΔE)降低了22.2%，EI降低了26.2%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了无需标注数据的语义感知3D形变，在保持局部细节和全局语义一致性的同时，显著提升了形变质量。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Motivation: 现有基于条件扩散模型的方法泛化性差，主要因为位置测量受用户体型影响大，难以跨用户适用。

Method: 将姿态估计建模为逆问题，使用预训练扩散模型仅以旋转测量为条件，通过位置测量的似然项引导生成过程。

Result: 提出的InPose方法能够零样本泛化到不同用户，生成符合稀疏体表测量的高可能性姿态序列。

Conclusion: 通过分离旋转和位置信息，结合扩散模型先验和测量似然，实现了跨用户的零样本姿态估计。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Motivation: 传统卷积架构如U-Net在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面能力有限，限制了在复杂肿瘤结构上的性能。扩散模型在生成高保真医学图像和细化分割边界方面显示出强大潜力

Method: 在扩散过程核心嵌入视觉Transformer，利用全局上下文推理和迭代去噪来增强体积精度和边界精度。Transformer骨干网络能够更有效地建模整个MRI体积的空间关系，而扩散细化则减轻体素级误差并恢复细粒度肿瘤细节

Conclusion: 这种混合设计为神经肿瘤学提供了改进鲁棒性和可扩展性的途径，超越了传统的U-Net基线，展示了Transformer引导的扩散模型在推进肿瘤分割技术前沿的潜力

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Method: 采用双通道U-Net方法处理历史地图的高辐射度和风格复杂性，第一通道生成初步地图识别混淆区域，第二通道使用精炼数据集和第一模型输出最小化辐射噪声。

Result: 处理了941个高分辨率图块，覆盖整个法国本土，最终镶嵌图总体准确率达到73%，有效捕捉了多样城市模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功克服了历史地图的常见伪影，公开发布了代码、训练数据集和全国城市栅格数据，支持长期城市化动态研究。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

TL;DR: 分析SAM2等视频对象分割模型在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中基于点跟踪的失败模式，发现点跟踪对于手术工具表现良好，但对于解剖目标表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点跟踪在手术视频中提供高效低成本的替代方案，但其在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败情况尚未充分了解。

Method: 系统分析腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点跟踪的失败模式，比较点跟踪与分割掩码初始化在胆囊、抓钳和L型电钩三个手术目标上的性能。

Result: 点跟踪在手术工具上表现有竞争力，但在解剖目标上持续表现不佳，组织相似性和模糊边界导致失败。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析揭示了影响跟踪结果的关键因素，并提供了选择与放置跟踪点的实用建议以改善手术视频分析性能。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

TL;DR: 提出FFREEDG新任务：在服务器预训练后，仅使用客户端未标注数据进行联邦学习，不重新访问源数据。提出FRIEREN框架，利用视觉基础模型和视觉-语言解码器解决语义分割的领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在语义分割任务中面临领域偏移挑战，特别是当客户端数据未标注时。现有方法要么不现实地假设有标注数据，要么未能充分利用现代视觉基础模型的能力。

Method: 使用视觉-语言解码器，结合CLIP文本嵌入改善语义消歧；采用弱到强一致性学习策略，在伪标签上进行鲁棒的本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实、清晰到恶劣天气的基准测试中，框架有效解决了新任务，性能与现有领域泛化和适应方法相当，为未来研究建立了强基线。

Conclusion: FRIEREN框架成功解决了FFREEDG任务，展示了在仅使用未标注客户端数据的情况下进行联邦语义分割的可行性，为隐私保护的领域适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

TL;DR: ASK-Hint是一个基于动作知识的结构化提示框架，通过细粒度指导问题提升冻结视觉语言模型在视频异常检测中的性能，在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法过于抽象，忽略了监控视频中定义复杂异常的人-物交互或动作语义等细粒度信息，需要更精确和可解释的推理方法。

Method: 将提示组织成语义连贯的组别（如暴力、财产犯罪、公共安全），制定细粒度的指导问题，使模型预测与判别性视觉线索对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上，ASK-Hint持续提升AUC，相比微调和免训练方法都达到最先进性能，并提供可解释的异常推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 提示的粒度在视频异常检测中至关重要，ASK-Hint为可解释的视频异常检测提供了一个新的免训练和可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过使用3D自监督教师模型蒸馏的几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，有效解决了2D到3D特征转移中的语义与几何结构不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在将2D视觉语言模型特征转移到3D语义分割时面临权衡：直接投影会产生噪声和碎片化预测，而强制几何一致性需要昂贵的训练流程和大规模标注数据。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法，使用小型学生亲和网络利用从3D自监督教师模型蒸馏的几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，并在推理时采用几何引导池化模块进一步去噪。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试中，GeoPurify达到或超过最先进性能，同时仅使用约1.5%的训练数据，表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在几何信息和学习的亲和网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征转移中的权衡问题，实现了优越的数据效率。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于猪耳静脉模式的非侵入式生物识别方法，使用智能手机采集图像，通过计算机视觉和机器学习实现98.12%的识别准确率，为小规模养殖户提供成本效益高的动物识别方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猪只识别方法（如耳标、芯片）不可靠、成本高且主要针对纯种猪，不适用于小规模养殖户。需要一种非侵入式、成本效益高的替代方案。

Method: 收集20头混种猪的800张耳部图像，使用智能手机和简单背光拍摄。开发多阶段计算机视觉流程增强静脉可见性，提取结构和空间特征生成生物特征签名，使用机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）在混种猪群中达到98.12%的识别准确率。从图像处理到分类的整个过程平均耗时8.3秒，适合实时农场部署。

Conclusion: 该系统通过用永久性生物标记替代易损的物理标识，为养殖户提供成本效益高且无压力的动物识别方法，证实了耳静脉生物识别在数字化畜牧管理中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

Motivation: 解决密集和遮挡场景中离散检测方法失效的问题，需要开发能够处理多类别对象计数的密度图估计方法。

Method: 使用Twins金字塔视觉变换器作为骨干网络，构建专门的多类别计数头，采用多尺度解码方法，并添加基于分割的类别聚焦模块来抑制训练时的类别间干扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中表现出色，相比之前的多类别人群计数方法，MAE分别降低了33%、43%和64%。与YOLOv11的比较验证了在密集场景中人群计数方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过区域损失将多类别人群计数扩展到新领域，在生物多样性监测数据集上的应用展示了其支持保护工作和实现可扩展生态洞察的能力。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable

TL;DR: TempoControl是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过优化交叉注意力图来实现视频生成中的细粒度时间控制，让用户能够精确指定视觉元素在生成序列中的出现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成视频模型虽然能够基于自然语言提示创建高质量视频，但缺乏细粒度的时间控制能力，无法让用户指定特定视觉元素在生成序列中的具体出现时间。

Method: TempoControl利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过新颖的优化方法引导概念的时间安排。该方法基于三个互补原则：通过相关性对齐时间形状、通过能量放大可见性区域、通过熵保持空间焦点。

Result: TempoControl能够在确保高视频质量和多样性的同时，实现对时间安排的精确控制。该方法在多种视频生成应用中表现出有效性，包括单对象和多对象的时间重排序，以及动作和音频对齐的生成。

Conclusion: TempoControl提供了一种有效的方法来解决生成视频模型中缺乏细粒度时间控制的问题，无需重新训练或额外监督即可实现精确的时间对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在结构化信息丰富场景（如交通地图）中的细粒度视觉推理能力不足，标准强化学习面临稀疏奖励和优化不稳定的挑战。

Method: 构建ReasonMap-Plus数据集提供密集奖励信号，提出RewardMap多阶段RL框架，包含难度感知奖励设计和从简单感知到复杂推理的渐进训练策略。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus上实验显示，RewardMap各组件均带来性能提升，组合使用效果最佳，在6个基准测试中平均提升3.47%。

Conclusion: RewardMap有效解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉推理中的稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了视觉理解和推理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow是首个有效利用FLUX强大先验进行拖拽式图像编辑的框架，通过区域级编辑范式、个性化适配器和多模态大语言模型，在拖拽编辑任务上显著超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型从UNet-based DDPMs转向更可扩展的DiT with flow matching（如SD3.5、FLUX），生成先验变得更强，但拖拽式编辑尚未从中受益。传统拖拽编辑在目标区域存在失真问题，因为早期基础模型的先验不足。

Method: 1. 引入区域级编辑范式，使用仿射变换提供更丰富一致的特征监督；2. 集成预训练的开域个性化适配器（如IP-Adapter）增强主体一致性；3. 通过梯度掩码硬约束保持背景保真度；4. 使用多模态大语言模型解决任务模糊性。

Result: 在DragBench-DR和ReD Bench上的广泛实验表明，DragFlow超越了基于点和基于区域的基线方法，在拖拽式图像编辑中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DragFlow成功利用FLUX的强大先验，通过区域级编辑范式解决了DiT特征结构化不足的问题，为拖拽式图像编辑带来了实质性改进。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了F2C方法，通过选择关键片段而非孤立关键帧来保留视频的时间动态信息，同时采用自适应分辨率策略保持固定计算预算，显著提升了视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型面临"大海捞针"问题：原始视频帧产生的大量视觉标记会耗尽模型上下文窗口。现有解决方案通过选择稀疏帧来减少标记数量，但丢弃了基本的时间动态信息，导致对运动和事件连续性的推理效果不佳。

Method: 提出F2C方法：1）从孤立关键帧选择扩展到关键片段选择，保留时间连贯性；2）采用自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，确保每个视频的标记数量恒定。

Result: 在三个长视频基准测试上的实验表明，这种无需训练的方法在Video-MME、LongVideoBench和MLVU基准上分别比均匀采样提升了8.1%、5.6%和10.3%。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在帧选择中保持时间连贯性的重要性，并为将视频大语言模型扩展到实际视频理解应用提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

*Sathira Silva,Eman Ali,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: microCLIP是一个自训练框架，通过联合优化CLIP的视觉和文本表示来提升细粒度图像分类性能，核心包括面向显著性的注意力池化、双头LLM分类器和动态知识聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型依赖粗粒度全局特征，在细粒度分类任务上表现受限。现有方法通过LLM描述对齐CLIP的[CLS]标记，但忽略了空间精度。

Method: 提出Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling构建细粒度标记，与全局[CLS]标记融合；使用双头LLM分类器（冻结和可学习）稳定适应；开发动态知识聚合迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 在13个细粒度基准测试中平均准确率提升2.90%，仅需轻量适应。

Conclusion: microCLIP能有效挖掘CLIP中的潜在细粒度信号，显著提升细粒度分类性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

TL;DR: VidGuard-R1是首个通过多模态大语言模型和群体相对策略优化实现的高精度视频真实性检测器，能够提供可解释的判断理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频技术的快速发展，需要有效的检测工具来应对错误信息和声誉损害等社会风险，同时检测模型需要提供可解释的说明以确保监管机构和终端用户的透明度。

Method: 使用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)微调多模态大语言模型(MLLM)，构建包含14万真实和AI生成视频的挑战性数据集，并设计专门针对时间伪影和生成复杂度的奖励模型。

Result: VidGuard-R1在现有基准测试中实现了最先进的零样本性能，额外训练后准确率超过95%，并能产生精确且可解释的判断理由。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了首个结合高精度检测和可解释推理的视频真实性检测器，为应对AI生成视频带来的社会风险提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出一种简单有效的方法来缓解长视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需长视频教师监督或重新训练长视频数据集。通过利用教师模型的丰富知识为自生成长视频提供指导，实现20倍长度扩展。

Method: 利用教师模型的知识为自生成长视频提供指导，通过从自生成长视频中抽取片段来指导学生模型，保持时间一致性，避免过曝光和错误累积问题。

Result: 能够生成长达4分15秒的视频，相当于基础模型位置嵌入支持的最大跨度的99.9%，比基线模型长50倍以上。在标准基准测试中，在保真度和一致性方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了长视频生成中的质量退化问题，实现了显著的视频长度扩展，同时保持了高质量的时间一致性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

TL;DR: KineMask是一种物理引导的视频生成方法，通过两阶段训练策略实现真实的刚体控制、交互和效果，显著改进了物体交互的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物理可信的物体交互方面仍存在困难，缺乏基于物理的控制机制，限制了其在机器人学和具身决策等领域的应用潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略，通过物体掩码逐步移除未来运动监督，在合成场景上训练视频扩散模型，并整合低级运动控制与高级文本条件。

Result: 在真实场景中显著改善了物体交互效果，相比同类规模模型有显著提升，消融研究验证了低级和高级条件在视频扩散模型中的互补作用。

Conclusion: KineMask通过物理引导的视频生成方法成功实现了更真实的物体交互和控制，为复杂动态现象合成提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Motivation: 当前视频模型缺乏精细控制能力，无法作为世界模型使用。通用家用机器人需要实时精细运动控制来处理精细任务和紧急情况。

Method: 开发了特征学习范式来对齐多模态信息，同时保留每个模态的独特信息；提出了正则化方案来增强动作轨迹特征在复杂交互动态中的因果性。

Result: 实验表明，整合多模态感官信息提高了模拟精度并减少了时间漂移。广泛的消融研究和下游应用证明了方法的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 多模态细粒度动作模型能够有效模拟精细交互动态，为机器人精细控制提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Motivation: 解决多模态语言模型中视频理解受限于上下文长度的问题，模型常错过关键过渡帧且难以在长时间尺度上保持连贯性。

Method: 采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法，对文本保持密集注意力，对视频使用原生稀疏注意力(NSA)，通过端到端训练适配Qwen2.5-VL模型。

Result: 相比令牌压缩和无训练稀疏基线，VideoNSA在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试中表现更优，能可靠扩展到128K令牌。

Conclusion: 研究发现：(1)可靠扩展到128K令牌；(2)固定预算下存在最优的全局-局部注意力分配；(3)任务依赖的分支使用模式；(4)可学习的组合稀疏注意力有助于诱导动态注意力汇聚点。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseShift是一种无需训练的方法，通过重新校准不同分辨率下的噪声水平来解决扩散模型在低分辨率图像生成中的质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高分辨率文本到图像生成器无法为不需要高分辨率图像的用户提供经济高效的替代方案，因为模型在训练分辨率之外泛化能力差。

Method: 提出NoiseShift方法，根据分辨率大小重新校准去噪器的噪声水平，无需改变模型架构或采样计划，与现有模型兼容。

Result: 在LAION-COCO数据集上，NoiseShift将SD3.5的FID提高了15.89%，SD3提高了8.56%，Flux-Dev提高了2.44%；在CelebA数据集上，分别提高了10.36%、5.19%和3.02%。

Conclusion: NoiseShift能有效缓解分辨率相关的伪影，显著提升低分辨率图像生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从视频中推断需要时间信息才能判断的动态物理属性，如弹性、粘度和动态摩擦，以推动计算机视觉在物理推理方面的发展。

Method: 收集了三个物理属性的新视频数据集；探索了三种推理方法：基于经典计算机视觉技术的预言机方法、使用视觉提示和可训练提示向量的简单读出机制、以及多模态大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 生成式或自监督训练的视频基础模型表现相似，但落后于预言机方法；多模态大语言模型目前表现较差，但通过合适的提示可以改善性能。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在动态物理属性预测任务上表现出潜力，但仍有改进空间；多模态大语言模型需要更好的提示策略来提升性能。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Motivation: 日常物体交互产生的声音具有独特性，但现有模型难以区分这些声音与相关物体的联系。受人类感知启发，需要开发能够将声音与直接参与物体关联的模型。

Method: 开发自动管道计算参与物体的分割掩码，在训练中引导模型关注交互中最具信息量的区域；使用槽注意力视觉编码器进一步强化物体先验；基于第一人称视角视频的多模态对象感知框架。

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Method: 使用核密度估计(KDE)识别低密度区域，策略性地注入高斯点嵌入视角依赖的幻觉物体，同时采用自适应噪声策略破坏多视角一致性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效的3DGS投毒攻击方法，并建立了基于KDE的系统评估协议，为未来研究提供客观基准。

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型在单实体提示上表现优秀，但在多主体描述中经常出现属性泄漏、身份纠缠和主体遗漏等问题，需要专门的方法来提升多主体保真度。

Method: 通过随机最优控制视角看待流匹配，提出了两种算法：(1)无需训练、测试时控制的单次更新基础速度扰动方法；(2)轻量级微调规则Adjoint Matching，通过反向伴随信号回归控制网络。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3.5、FLUX和Stable Diffusion XL上，两种算法都持续提升了多主体对齐度，同时保持了基础模型的风格。测试时控制可在商用GPU上高效运行，微调控制器在有限提示上训练后能泛化到未见过的提示。

Conclusion: FOCUS方法在多个模型上实现了最先进的多主体保真度，为多主体文本到图像生成提供了统一的理论框架和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

Method: 提出基于联合人机不确定性的框架，结合模型的认知不确定性和人类说话者的犹豫线索与置信信号，指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三种兽医专用LLM总结工具在兽医肿瘤记录上的表现，发现Product 1（Hachiko）在事实准确性、完整性和组织性方面表现最佳，并验证了LLM作为评估者的可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床环境中应用日益增多，但在兽医医学领域的性能尚未充分探索，需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的有效性。

Method: 使用标准化的兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过评分框架（LLM作为评判者）对三种商业兽医LLM总结工具在五个领域进行评分：事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织性。

Result: Product 1获得最高综合表现（中位数平均分4.61），在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得完美中位数分数。评估框架本身具有高可重复性，三个独立运行的标准差很小。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具的重要性得到证实，LLM作为评判者的评估方法是兽医医学临床NLP总结评估的可扩展且可重复的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化流水线实现高效的事实核查，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，优于使用更大模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算成本高且不透明。ClaimCheck旨在开发一个透明、高效的系统，使用小语言模型实现准确的事实核查。

Method: 采用模块化验证流水线，包括网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和总结、证据合成和重新检索、以及声明裁决评估。每个模块都针对小语言模型进行优化。

Result: 使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，优于使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的模块化架构和提示策略，小语言模型能够克服其局限性，实现高效且可解释的事实核查，为透明AI系统的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

TL;DR: 论文质疑当前数学基准测试高估了LLMs的推理能力，并提出了EEFSUVA新基准来更全面地评估数学推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要来自IMO等知名竞赛，可能因数据污染和问题类型单一而高估LLMs的真实推理能力

Method: 引入EEFSUVA基准，该基准收集自东欧和前苏联国家较少流通的区域性和国家级奥赛题目

Result: 初步结果显示，即使最先进的LLMs在EEFSUVA上的表现也明显低于其他奥赛风格基准

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并指导未来模型开发

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在处理系统提示与用户输入的层次冲突时表现脆弱，更倾向于服从社会线索而非系统指令，揭示了模型内部冲突检测与解决机制的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型本应遵循层次化指令（系统提示优先于用户输入），但现有研究表明它们经常忽略这一规则而更倾向于服从社会线索（如权威或共识），需要从机制层面理解这一行为。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测强度，并进行转向实验验证社会线索向量的作用机制。

Result: 冲突决策信号在早期层被编码，系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同子空间；系统-用户冲突检测更强但解决不一致，而社会冲突检测和解决都更一致；社会线索向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 研究解释了系统服从的脆弱性，强调了开发轻量级层次敏感对齐方法的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需人工标注的文档重排序方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后用对比学习微调小型transformer模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排序中表现出色但计算成本高，而微调小模型需要稀缺的人工标注数据，需要找到平衡性能与效率的解决方案

Method: 使用LLM从领域特定语料生成合成查询，用LLM分类器标注正负样本对，然后用LCE损失进行对比学习微调小型transformer模型

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上显著提升领域内性能，并在领域外任务中表现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，在降低计算成本的同时保持了强大的重排序能力

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织的几何分析新框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，跨7个嵌入模型和8个降维方法进行交叉验证，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的分布，进行123个短语的子网络分析。

Result: 有意义字符展现丰富的几何多样性，结构部首坍缩为紧密聚类；子网络分析显示从基本字符到短语的系统性语义扩展。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供计算支持，建立了语义组织几何分析的新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

Motivation: 解决信息过载和高风险决策需求下自动摘要的可靠性问题，避免过度自信的预测。

Method: 构建条件生成式摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵测量不确定性，结合熵正则化和风险感知损失进行联合优化，并集成风险评分和调控模块。

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 为可信摘要提供了系统性解决方案，在方法论层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Benchmark Profiling诊断框架，通过梯度重要性评分和参数消融将基准测试性能分解为10种认知能力，量化每种能力对模型在基准测试中成功的贡献程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试分数往往高估真实能力，因为它们掩盖了任务实际所需的技能组合，缺乏系统方法来验证这些基准是否真正测量所声称的能力标签。

Method: 结合梯度重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算能力影响分数(AIS)来量化每种认知能力对基准测试表现的贡献。

Result: 分析三个指令调优模型在10个基准测试中的表现发现：大多数基准测试依赖多种能力而非单一能力；相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；代码生成基准测试需要广泛的多技能改进；不相关能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力，并为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在能力、延迟和计算成本方面的多样性给部署带来了挑战，需要为每个提示选择最合适的模型来优化性能与效率的权衡。

Method: 利用从提示中提取的丰富、人类可读特征（任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索等），结合轻量级代理求解器的信号，通过神经排序模型预测每个模型的效用。

Result: 在包含36,497个提示和11个最先进LLM的RouterBench上，该方法达到了89.2%的oracle效用，同时提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。

Conclusion: 研究表明多维度特征提取和混合排序目标的重要性，凸显了特征驱动路由在高效透明LLM部署中的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在皮肤病学等复杂领域中结构化推理能力受限的问题，主要挑战包括数据稀缺和高级训练技术的高计算成本。

Method: 采用多阶段训练流程：首先使用GRPO++进行推理导向的疾病识别，然后进行监督微调以获得对话能力，最后使用基于知识图谱的DPO对齐来减少事实错误。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤病数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法相比标准微调方法取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了该管道作为在资源受限环境中开发专业化、可靠视觉语言模型的可行途径的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，根据可靠性估计重定向查询，显著减少幻觉并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有后生成修正方法计算成本高且无法预防不可靠内容生成

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计，统一置信度分数决定四个路径的路由

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著改善（0.74 vs 0.42基线），计算成本降低40%，F1分数从0.61提升到0.82，假阳性率低至0.09

Conclusion: 从反应性修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为LLM可靠性增强提供了计算效率高的方法

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现padding tokens在LLMs中并非无害，即使少量padding也会影响模型激活、生成质量、偏见和安全防护，构成部署风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: padding tokens在LLM批处理推理中被广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致其影响计算过程，这种影响程度尚不明确

Method: 在三个开源模型家族(Llama、Gemma、Qwen)中系统研究padding影响，通过插入控制数量的padding并评估激活、生成质量、偏见和安全四个维度

Result: 即使少量padding也会改变隐藏表示、降低小模型质量、以不可预测方式改变偏见、削弱安全防护机制

Conclusion: padding不是无害细节，而是需要在部署中仔细处理的鲁棒性风险

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一个新颖的执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入任务特定指令到隔离的侧路径，显著减少多轮交互中子任务处理的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单个模型需要处理多样化的子任务来更有效地支持用户请求。传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，产生显著计算开销。

Method: 重用主任务的键值缓存，将任务特定指令注入隔离的侧路径，子任务执行后通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径。开发了针对小规模模型的分层分类策略来支持子任务选择。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能，实现了可扩展和高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX通过创新的上下文指令流机制，有效解决了多任务对话中的计算效率问题，为设备端LLM应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [96] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了人工年龄评分(AAS)作为衡量AI系统记忆老化的指标，通过分析语言模型在会话重置时语义记忆稳定而情景记忆崩溃的现象来量化结构性老化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统记忆老化的结构性特征，特别是大型语言模型中语义记忆稳定与情景记忆易失的不对称现象，需要开发一个理论严谨、任务无关的诊断工具。

Method: 引入AAS作为基于熵的、对数尺度的记忆老化度量指标，在25天的双语研究中测试ChatGPT-5，分为无状态和持久交互两个阶段，分析模型在会话重置前后的记忆表现。

Result: 持久会话中模型能同时回忆语义和情景细节，AAS接近理论最小值；会话重置后语义一致性保持但情景连续性丧失，AAS急剧上升，表明结构性记忆老化。

Conclusion: AAS是一个理论基础坚实、任务独立的诊断工具，可用于评估人工系统中的记忆退化，基于冯·诺依曼、香农和图灵的理论框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出ARGRE框架，通过建模毒性转换轨迹，使用自回归奖励模型指导表示编辑，实现高效低毒的LLM净化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM净化方法干预不精确，主要因为对毒性和非毒性输出之间的转换空间探索不足

Method: ARGRE框架：识别非毒性语义方向，在毒性和非毒性表示间插值构建转换轨迹，训练自回归奖励模型指导自适应两步编辑过程

Result: 在8个LLM上实验，毒性降低62.21%，推理时间减少47.58%，同时保持模型核心能力

Conclusion: ARGRE通过精确建模毒性转换空间，实现了高效且保持模型能力的净化方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: 开发了一个精神压力本体论(MeSO)，并评估使用大型语言模型从叙述文本中提取结构化压力信息的可行性，准确率达到78.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的压力信息通常以非结构化文本形式存在，限制了临床效用，需要开发结构化提取方法来改善压力文档的一致性。

Method: 整合压力理论模型和11个验证的压力评估工具开发精神压力本体论(MeSO)，使用Claude Sonnet 4从Reddit帖子中提取6类压力相关信息，并通过人工评估准确性。

Result: MeSO包含181个概念，LLM正确识别了78.2%的可提取项目，所有正确提取的项目都能准确映射到本体论，但仍有24个相关概念未包含在现有本体论中。

Conclusion: 证明了使用本体论引导的LLM进行结构化压力信息提取的可行性，有潜力提高环境AI系统中压力文档的一致性和实用性。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

TL;DR: SeMob是一个基于大语言模型的语义合成管道，用于动态移动性预测。它通过多智能体框架从复杂在线文本中提取时空相关语义信息，并通过渐进融合架构将文本上下文与时空数据结合，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性的突然变化，需要一种能够有效整合文本语义和时空数据的方法。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，LLM智能体自动从复杂在线文本中提取和推理时空相关信息；提出创新的渐进融合架构，将细粒度相关上下文与时空数据融合；利用预训练的事件先验知识丰富事件驱动的预测洞察。

Result: 在通过该管道构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比纯时空模型在MAE和RMSE上分别最大降低了13.92%和11.12%；在事件发生位置和时间附近的时空区域表现出更明显的优势。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过有效整合文本语义和时空数据，显著提升了人类移动性预测的准确性，特别是在事件驱动的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

TL;DR: 提出基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的top-1潜在特征选择和token-wise衰减引导策略，有效提升语言模型的数学推理能力，优于均值激活差异方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE潜在特征包含非语义特征（如标点符号），而常数SAE引导会产生退化输出（如重复单词），需要更精确的语义特征选择和引导策略。

Method: 1) 选择top-1最相关的SAE潜在特征；2) 引入token-wise衰减引导策略，避免退化输出；3) 与均值激活差异基线进行公平比较。

Result: 引导与推理相关的SAE潜在特征能可靠地引发逐步数学推理，提升推理质量，在数学推理基准测试中优于均值激活差异方法，在IF-Eval中表现相当。

Conclusion: SAE通过精确的潜在特征选择和衰减引导策略，能有效引导语言模型进行数学推理，功能上类似于添加引导token的效果。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Motivation: 现有语言模型评估主要关注全球流行体育项目，忽视了区域性和本土传统体育文化，需要专门的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含33,000道多模态选择题的数据集，涵盖文本和图像模态，使用零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略评估各种语言模型。

Conclusion: CultSportQA为评估AI对传统体育的理解能力设立了新标准，促进了多语言和多元文化体育认知的研究。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

TL;DR: 提出SSTAG方法，通过文本作为统一表示媒介，结合LLM的语义推理和GNN的结构建模能力，解决图学习中的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图学习模型通常在单个图数据集上训练，限制了跨图和跨任务的泛化能力，且依赖大量标注数据。与NLP和CV不同，图结构数据具有异质性特征，需要解决领域特定特征空间和结构多样性带来的挑战。

Method: 采用结构感知的自监督学习方法，引入双重知识蒸馏框架，将LLM和GNN共同蒸馏到结构感知的多层感知器中。还设计了内存机制存储典型图表示，与内存锚点对齐以整合不变知识。

Result: 实验表明SSTAG在跨域迁移学习任务中优于最先进模型，具有卓越的可扩展性，在保持竞争性能的同时降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: SSTAG成功地将LLM的语义能力与GNN的结构建模相结合，为文本属性图提供了有效的跨域泛化解决方案，显著提升了可扩展性和推理效率。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展的有效方法，为更可靠的科学AI训练和评估铺平道路

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual

techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在实体链接任务中虽然表现优异，但需要资源密集的多轮推理来获得可靠的不确定性估计，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用自监督方法从单次LLM输出的token级特征中估计不确定性，无需多次生成。

Result: 在多个LLM上的评估表明，该方法能有效检测低准确性输出，计算成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了一种计算效率高的不确定性估计方案，支持成本有效的集成。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Motivation: 随着LLM在大量未筛选语料上训练，理解模型表示及其内部化的数据成为主要挑战，需要新的方法来解释模型行为和数据内在结构

Method: 在简·奥斯汀小说上训练GPT风格transformer模型，然后对多层隐藏状态应用稀疏自编码器，提取稀疏可解释特征

Result: 发现了反映语料中关键叙事和概念的稀疏特征，包括性别、阶级和社会责任等主题

Conclusion: LLM与SAEs结合可作为复杂数据集的可扩展探针，为语料探索、偏见发现和大规模模型可解释性提供新途径

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，这种评估方式隐含假设模型在其他任务格式中表现一致，但这一假设尚未得到验证。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，诱导其偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定答案，然后在不同的MCQA基准和长文本生成任务中评估这些行为的泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示，MCQA偏见基准的表现不能可靠预测模型在其他MCQA基准和长文本任务中的表现，表明当前基准的跨任务泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见基准在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化证据，作者提出了一个评估套件来测量未来模型和基准的行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出受到不透明且频繁变化的公司内容审核政策影响，这些拒绝行为反映了公司政策并微妙地塑造公共话语。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，审计OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek（英文和中文版本），并进行定性分析分类拒绝形式。

Result: 发现公司政策变化（即使未公开宣布）可通过AI Watchman检测到，识别了公司和模型特定的内容审核差异。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实现这一目标的系统。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

TL;DR: 提出了RJE框架，通过检索-判断-探索机制改进知识图谱问答，使用专用辅助模块让小型LLM也能有效工作，在保持性能的同时显著减少LLM调用和token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGQA方法存在局限性：检索方法受限于检索质量，智能体方法过度依赖专有LLM。需要一种既能提升性能又能降低对专有LLM依赖的解决方案。

Method: RJE框架包含三个核心组件：检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件性探索额外证据。引入三个专用辅助模块：推理路径排序、问题分解、检索器辅助探索。

Result: 使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）时优于现有基线，小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）无需微调即可达到竞争性结果。相比智能体方法显著减少LLM调用次数和token使用量。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了现有KGQA方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时降低了对专有LLM的依赖，并为小型LLM的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

TL;DR: 使用零样本分类方法评估6个主流大语言模型的政治偏见，发现所有模型都表现出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和预设拒绝现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速普及使其在政治话语中占据主导地位，但训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致的内在政治偏见问题亟待解决

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态对齐、主题相关性、响应情感和客观性四个维度，对6个主流LLM的1800个响应进行分析，使用四个不同的微调分类算法计算偏见评估指标

Result: 所有评估的6个LLM都显示出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在明显的推理替代和预设拒绝现象

Conclusion: 研究强调人机交互中的心理影响，内在偏见可能渗透公共话语，导致政治格局扭曲，表现为从众或极化，取决于地区现有的社会政治结构

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究测试了GPT-OSS-20B模型在不同社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次下的拒绝行为，发现特定提示策略可以显著改变模型对有害任务的协助率，并揭示了跨语言和推理栈的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究大型语言模型在面对有害请求时的拒绝行为如何受到提示框架、语言选择和指令层次的影响，以评估模型安全性的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过80次种子迭代测试多个危害领域，使用复合提示策略（教育者角色、安全前提、步骤提示），比较不同语言和角色扮演的效果，并引入AI辅助硬化方法。

Result: 复合提示可将ZIP炸弹任务的协助率从0%提升至97.5%；德语和法语比英语更容易泄露信息；Linux终端角色扮演可覆盖开发者规则；AI硬化方法可将泄露率降至0%。

Conclusion: 模型拒绝行为对提示框架高度敏感，存在跨语言和推理栈的不一致性，OpenAI审核API对实际有害输出的捕获不足，需要更鲁棒的安全评估方法。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现OpenAI的GPT-OSS-20b模型在豪萨语等低资源语言环境中存在严重的安全漏洞，包括文化偏见、事实错误和安全性失效，特别在礼貌语言提示下会出现奖励破解现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑该模型在代表不足社区用户中的可靠性，特别关注低资源语言环境下的安全对齐表现。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行了61人参与的毒性认知调查。

Result: 模型在豪萨语中生成有害、文化不敏感和事实错误内容，错误认为常见杀虫剂和灭鼠剂对人类安全，无法区分生熟食物，使用贬低性谚语构建错误论点。

Conclusion: 这些问题源于低资源语言环境下安全调优不足，模型优先考虑流利输出而非安全性和真实性，凸显了当前红队测试在低资源环境中的重大差距。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Motivation: 现有基于logits的AI文本检测器仅依赖对数概率统计，存在性能不足的问题，需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出AdaDetectGPT分类器，从训练数据中自适应学习见证函数来增强logits-based检测器的性能。

Result: 在多种数据集和LLM组合中，AdaDetectGPT几乎一致地改进了现有最先进方法，改进幅度最高可达58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过自适应学习策略显著提升了AI文本检测性能，为区分人类和LLM生成文本提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成连贯文本方面表现出色，但部署时存在生成有害或不适当内容的风险，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 渐进式自反思(PSR)技术，通过多轮自反思动态修正输出，并引入轻量级自反思预测器根据输入复杂度自适应调整反思轮数。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct上攻击成功率从77.5%降至5.9%，在Llama-3.1-8B基础模型上从89.7%降至5.6%，在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上从44.4%降至3.8%。

Conclusion: 渐进式自反思作为一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过按输入风险状况动态分配计算资源，有效提升大语言模型安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

TL;DR: 提出了TraceDet框架，利用扩散大语言模型的多步去噪过程中的中间步骤进行幻觉检测，相比基线方法在AUROC指标上平均提升15.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题研究不足，现有检测方法主要针对自回归模型，依赖单步生成信号，不适用于多步去噪的扩散模型。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，每个动作定义为模型基于前一个中间输出对清理后响应的预测，识别对幻觉响应最具信息量的子轨迹。

Result: 在各种开源扩散大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，TraceDet持续改进幻觉检测性能。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过利用扩散大语言模型多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号，有效解决了扩散模型的幻觉检测问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虽然集成了代码解释器和搜索等工具增强了LLM推理能力，但缺乏关于如何有效组合文本推理、编码和搜索的实用指导。核心挑战是如何为多样化问题有效结合这些能力。

Method: TUMIX框架并行运行多个代理，每个代理采用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径。代理基于问题和先前答案迭代地共享和精炼响应。

Result: 在关键推理基准测试中，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强和测试时扩展方法实现了显著提升，在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上平均准确率提高了3.55%，推理成本相近。

Conclusion: 代理多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过使用LLM自动优化代理设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，仅以49%的推理成本保持性能。进一步扩展可以实现更高性能，但成本更高。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

TL;DR: HiSpec是一种分层推测解码框架，利用早期退出模型进行低开销的中间验证，显著提升LLM推理吞吐量，平均提升1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码中验证阶段通常是瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时，验证比token生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用增加和准确性妥协等问题。

Method: 利用早期退出模型进行中间验证，允许token提前退出层遍历；设计方法重用draft、中间验证器和目标模型之间的KV缓存和隐藏状态；定期验证中间验证器接受的draft token。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上的评估显示，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提升吞吐量1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过早期退出模型实现高效的中间验证，显著提升推测解码的吞吐量，同时保持准确性，解决了验证瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在一般语言任务上表现出色，但在需要因果或时序推理的事件问题上表现不佳。

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，包含9种提示配置（零样本、少样本、思维链×文本、图、文本+图）。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准上平均准确率提高5%，零样本设置下提升12%，图增强思维链提示有效时提升18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供灵活的结构编码方式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于低成本自动评估语言模型响应质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应评估方法要么成本过高（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么与现实条件相差甚远（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要更实用且经济的解决方案

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离将目标候选与任意LM生成文本进行匹配，采用参数少于100亿的嵌入模型，实现低成本响应分类

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，回归得分约0.97，与人工标注者相比准确率约96%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本相对较低但鲁棒性强的语言模型响应分类方案

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一个递归稀疏结构化Transformer，通过循环推理、自适应稀疏注意力和自组织编码器结构，解决了传统Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面存在局限性，主要由于刚性层堆叠、密集注意力依赖和位置编码依赖。

Method: 集成三个创新：循环推理与记忆单元(R2MU)用于有界深度迭代推理，自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)用于高效上下文选择，自组织编码器结构(SOES)用于无位置结构归纳。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在可比FLOPs和参数预算下持续优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer展示了在可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性方面的优势，为Transformer架构提供了改进方向。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于隐藏状态的无参数验证器，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态的几何可分性特征来验证输出正确性，无需训练参数，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM输出的方法存在局限性：基于文本的方法容易过拟合表面特征，基于概率置信度的方法在未校准模型上表现不佳。而模型内部隐藏状态同时包含语义信息和置信度信息，可作为更丰富的验证信号源。

Method: 提出CLUE验证器：1) 将每个推理轨迹总结为隐藏状态增量；2) 基于历史经验形成"成功"和"失败"聚类；3) 通过最近质心距离分类正确性。该方法无训练参数，仅依赖隐藏状态的几何可分性特征。

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA基准测试中，CLUE持续优于LLM-as-a-judge基线，匹配或超过现代基于置信度的方法。在AIME 24上，使用1.5B模型将准确率从56.7%(majority@64)提升到70.0%(top-maj@16)。

Conclusion: 模型内部隐藏状态包含丰富的验证信号，其几何可分性特征能够有效区分正确和错误输出。CLUE的简单设计证明了这一基础信号的有效性，为LLM输出验证提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented

MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a
fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show
significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving
substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state
of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PureTC-1B是一个针对传统中文的1B参数小语言模型，通过三阶段稳定化流程显著减少非传统中文字符输出，提高语言稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在传统中文应用中存在token级不稳定性问题，模型会不可预测地输出非传统中文字符或切换到其他语言，阻碍了在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 采用三阶段稳定化流程：1）在传统中文语料上进行持续预训练；2）使用指令数据进行监督微调；3）基于传统中文一致性偏好的直接偏好优化，使用参数高效的LoRA适配器而不需要全模型重训练。

Result: 在模拟真实使用场景的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型减少了51.3%的非传统中文输出token；在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言token。

Conclusion: 即使在1B规模下也能实现稳健的传统中文一致性，该流程可重现、仅需适配器且硬件友好，为传统中文及其他非英语语言提供了实用的语言稳定性增强方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

TL;DR: AMAS框架通过动态图设计器解决传统多智能体系统架构僵化的问题，能够根据任务特性自主优化图配置，在问答、数学推理和代码生成任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统受限于固定的图拓扑结构，缺乏上下文响应能力，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果下降。

Method: 引入AMAS框架，通过动态图设计器自主识别任务特定的最优图配置，利用轻量级LLM适应消除对通用结构模板的依赖，根据输入特性智能引导查询轨迹。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，AMAS系统性地超越最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基础要求。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了不同机器学习模型识别越狱提示的能力，发现微调BERT模型在检测越狱提示方面表现最佳，并发现提示结构中的显式自反性可能是越狱意图的信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户可以通过操纵输入文本来获取不良响应。这些越狱提示旨在绕过安全护栏，因此需要有效的方法来识别它们。

Method: 使用不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示与真实使用，包括检测使用新策略的越狱提示。最佳方法是端到端微调BERT模型进行越狱识别。

Result: 在当前数据集上，微调BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳。通过可视化分析发现，提示结构中的显式自反性可以区分越狱意图。

Conclusion: 微调BERT模型能有效识别越狱提示，提示结构中的显式自反性可作为越狱意图的检测信号。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Motivation: 自回归LLM在文本嵌入任务中表现受限，主要由于单向注意力机制的限制，需要研究能否通过双向注意力克服这一局限

Method: 对Llama架构进行额外训练，逐步启用双向注意力机制，并结合无监督/有监督对比学习

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了方法框架

Conclusion: 通过引入双向注意力和对比学习，有望改善LLM在文本嵌入任务中的语义表示能力

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Motivation: 网络安全攻防竞赛中，AI驱动的攻击系统发展迅速，而传统防御手段难以适应。现有安全工具功能分散，存在盲点，缺乏统一的闭环自主安全代理评估框架和基准。

Method: 引入CLASP框架，将安全生命周期（侦察、利用、根因分析、补丁合成、验证）与核心代理能力（规划、工具使用、记忆、推理、反思与感知）对齐，并定义CLC评分来量化闭环程度和操作有效性。

Result: 应用CLASP框架分析了21个代表性工作，识别了系统的优势领域和持续存在的能力差距，为评估安全代理能力提供了通用词汇和标准。

Conclusion: CLASP框架和CLC评分为推进功能级性能和测量闭环安全代理提供了必要的词汇、诊断工具和度量标准，有助于推动自主安全系统的发展。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Motivation: 多模态对话摘要需要强大的自动评估方法来降低成本，但缺乏基于人类标注的元评估基准。

Method: 提出MDSEval基准，包含图像共享对话和人类评判；使用相互排斥关键信息(MEKI)过滤框架确保数据质量；识别并形式化MDS特有的评估维度。

Result: 对最先进的模态评估方法进行基准测试，发现它们在区分先进MLLM生成的摘要方面存在局限性，且容易受到各种偏见影响。

Conclusion: MDSEval为多模态对话摘要评估提供了首个元评估基准，揭示了现有评估方法的不足，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender提出答案、Objectioner提出质疑、Host确保一致性的角色结构，实现自我修正推理，在GSM8K任务上比单提示提升约22%，推理连贯性评分提高10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议如Chain of Thought和Tree of Thought缺乏明确的外部质疑机制来引发自我修正，需要一种能够通过外部质疑引导模型自我修订的方法。

Method: 采用非对称协议：Defender提出答案，Objectioner提出质疑但不直接修复，Host确保一致性和结束。纯提示级别操作，无需重新训练。

Result: 在GSM8K任务上比单提示提升约22%，与CoT准确率相当，推理和连贯性评分提高10%以上；小模型Llama3.2:1b准确率提升约19%；无需工具或人工监督即可修正错误。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting在开放任务中增强探索和精炼能力，使假设和权衡明确，支持大规模质疑引导推理研究，适用于不同规模的模型。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否使用组合机制来解决组合任务，特别是它们在处理两跳事实召回任务时的内部工作机制。

Method: 使用logit lens分析残差流激活，识别模型在计算g(f(x))时的处理机制，并研究嵌入空间几何对机制选择的影响。

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，识别出两种处理机制（组合式和直接式），发现机制选择与嵌入空间中是否存在从x到g(f(x))的线性映射相关。

Conclusion: LLMs解决组合任务时采用不同的内部机制，机制选择受嵌入空间几何特性影响，这对理解模型内部工作原理具有重要意义。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Motivation: 医疗预咨询任务中，SFT训练数据的轮次分布存在偏斜，导致模型在长对话中产生重复但诊断信息不足的问题，即格式惯性。

Method: 采用数据为中心的方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 数据重平衡是解决医疗预咨询中格式惯性问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型的评估主要依赖聚合准确率，这种单一分数无法揭示模型在哪些方面以及如何改进。需要设计能够分解多模态推理子技能的基准测试。

Method: 开发MathLens基准测试，将性能分解为感知、推理和整合三个组件。提供视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题和感知技能探针等注释，所有内容都源自问题的符号规范以确保一致性。

Result: 分析发现：1）强化学习主要增强感知能力；2）推理能力只有与感知能力同步提升；3）整合能力是最弱的环节；4）不同训练方法的鲁棒性存在差异：RL提高图表变化下的稳定性，而多模态SFT因过拟合而降低稳定性。

Conclusion: MathLens基准测试能够有效分解多模态推理的子技能，揭示了不同训练方法对各组件的差异化影响，整合能力是当前模型的主要瓶颈，需要专门针对性的改进方法。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准中的信息转化为模块化、可重用的机器可解释本体，用于工厂设计和设备选择过程中的质量保证，通过语义推理实现阀门选择的自动化验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管工业工作数字化是趋势，但产品规格、产品类型数据表和设计标准仍然以文档为中心，需要将其转化为机器可解释的形式以提高效率。

Method: 使用建模模式创建模块化本体，将国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准中的知识转化为W3C兼容格式，并与顶级本体ISO DIS 23726-3对齐。

Result: 成功创建基于国际标准和行业规范的本体，在阀门选择过程中实现自动化验证，能够检查特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化本体使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，展示了向数字化智能标准转型的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Refusal Index (RI)指标，用于准确衡量LLM对超出其知识范围问题的拒绝能力，解决了现有指标在测量知识感知拒绝能力时的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确测量LLM的知识感知拒绝能力：简单的拒绝率指标存在偏差，校准指标是代理指标而非直接测量实际拒绝行为。

Method: 定义RI为拒绝概率与错误概率之间的Spearman等级相关性，设计轻量级双通道评估方法从两个标准评估运行中有效估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力，且在不同拒绝率下保持稳定。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLM事实性的重要但被忽视的方面：虽然LLM在事实任务中准确率高，但其拒绝行为可能不可靠且脆弱，需要将RI与传统准确率指标结合进行全面事实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频一致性和覆盖率比等指标与专家评分最相关，而LLM评估分数表现中等，表明无监督指标可用于初步筛选但不能完全替代人工判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能在法律自然语言处理中的快速发展，需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标（包括文档基础、语义、结构、伪真实数据和法律特定类别）评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决中提取7个语义块的质量，并与7168个专家评分（1-5李克特量表）进行验证。

Result: 词频一致性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率比/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513）与专家评分最相关，法律术语密度显示强负相关（Pearson r=-0.479），LLM评估分数表现中等（Pearson r=0.382）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标（包括基于LLM的方法）可实现可扩展的初步筛选，但由于中等相关性和低一致性系数，无法在高风险法律环境中完全替代人类判断。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)能够生成高度有说服力的垃圾评论，这些评论模仿人类写作，对现有检测系统构成挑战，威胁在线平台的可信度。

Method: 提出FraudSquad混合检测模型，结合预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和图门控变换器进行垃圾节点分类，无需手动特征工程或大量训练资源。

Result: 在三个LLM生成的垃圾评论数据集上，FraudSquad比最先进基线方法在精确率和召回率上分别提升高达44.22%和43.01%，在两个人工编写的垃圾数据集上也表现良好。

Conclusion: FraudSquad模型尺寸适中，需要最少的标注训练数据，是实际应用的实用解决方案，强调了在LLM时代适应垃圾检测的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题上存在语法盲点，即使语义简单但表达方式陌生时也会出错。通过从正确示例中提取语法模板重新表述问题，可以显著提高正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在数学推理中存在系统性失败模式——语法盲点，即模型会将熟悉的推理策略错误应用于语义简单但表达方式陌生的问题。

Method: 使用从正确示例中提取的语法模板重新表述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度。使用基于依存局部性理论(DLT)的指标量化语法复杂度。

Result: 重新表述后的问题往往能得到正确答案。更高的DLT分数与多个数据集上更高的失败率相关，表明语法复杂度是影响模型表现的关键因素。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源于结构不对齐而非概念难度，语法感知干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

TL;DR: SCRIBES是一个基于强化学习的框架，利用网页布局相似性生成可重用的提取脚本，实现高效的大规模半结构化网页内容提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTML表格、列表和信息框等半结构化内容在网络上占很大比例，但现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么因每页都需要LLM推理而资源密集。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用同一网站内网页的布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并通过在CommonCrawl数据上进行迭代训练来改进。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，并为GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提升超过4%。

Conclusion: SCRIBES实现了可扩展且资源高效的网页信息提取，解决了现有方法的泛化性和资源消耗问题。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

TL;DR: 该论文针对视觉-语言模型参数量大、训练数据远超儿童语言习得数据的问题，提出在低资源环境下开发语言模型和多模态模型，并通过模型融合方法提升多模态模型在纯语言任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型参数量庞大且训练数据量远超儿童语言习得的数据量，存在数据量不匹配的问题。多模态模型在纯语言任务上表现不佳，需要解决这一性能下降问题。

Method: 在低资源设置下开发语言模型和多模态模型，使用发展合理的数据集。通过模型融合方法，将多模态模型与纯语言模型的参数进行加权线性插值融合。

Result: 多模态模型在BabyLM基准测试中表现优于先前基线，但在关注语法的纯语言基准测试中表现不佳。模型融合能在一定程度上缓解这一问题，同时保持多模态性能。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在纯语言任务上确实存在性能下降问题，模型融合是缓解这一问题的有效方法，能在保持多模态性能的同时提升纯语言任务表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM后训练中获取新知识或纠正错误的高成本问题，以及重训练带来的意外副作用

Method: 采用闭环反馈机制和动态内存管理来缓解大规模顺序编辑的不稳定性和冲突，结合频繁知识融合和强局部性保护

Result: 在多个模型家族中编辑准确率提升10%-30%，显著减少知识遗忘

Conclusion: 为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演进的LLM提供了一个稳健框架

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Conclusion: 奖励模型是提升LLM推理能力的关键技术，本文提供了实用的部署建议和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

Conclusion: ILM为下一代LLM奠定了基础，使其不仅更鲁棒和基础化，而且从根本上更可控和可信。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Method: 提出Veri-R1在线强化学习框架，让LLM与搜索引擎交互，通过奖励信号明确塑造其规划、检索和推理行为，动态交互更准确地反映真实世界验证场景。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习对于精确和可信的声明验证是有效的，为未来研究提供了基础。代码已发布以支持社区在LLM赋能声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到价值概念的解释受社会文化背景和生活经历影响而具有主观性，需要开发能适应不同人类视角、避免偏向多数观点的AI系统。

Method: 使用SEAT（情感、情绪、论证、主题）维度作为个体解释视角的代理，在不同零样本和少样本设置下评估语言模型预测个体价值解释的能力。

Result: 同时提供所有SEAT维度时性能最佳，优于单个维度和无信息基线。不同标注者之间存在个体差异，强调考虑个体主观标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计学特征、研究标注行为对价值预测影响的尝试，为未来大规模验证奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了数据库模式规范化对自然语言转SQL系统性能的影响，发现规范化程度不同的模式在不同查询类型下表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL研究大多在固定模式上评估模型，忽视了模式设计对性能的重要影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统研究模式规范化对NL2SQL性能的影响。

Method: 使用八个领先的大型语言模型，在具有不同规范化程度的合成和真实数据集上进行评估。构建了形式化规范化(1NF-3NF)的合成数据集和实际学术论文数据集。

Result: 反规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使使用成本效益高的零样本模型；规范化模式(2NF/3NF)在基础表选择和连接类型预测方面存在挑战，但通过提供少量样本可显著缓解；对于聚合查询，规范化模式表现更好，因其能避免数据重复和NULL值问题。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于支持的查询类型。开发NL2SQL接口时应考虑模式设计，并在实际场景中集成自适应模式选择。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Method: 构建首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，系统比较传统基线、单语预训练模型和LLM（零样本提示和LoRA微调）在低资源环境下的表现。

Result: 实验表明LoRA调优的LLM与BanglaBERT竞争力相当，但文化语言特定的预训练对鲁棒性能仍至关重要，为低资源环境下的文化对齐审核工具建立了更强基准。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在低资源环境下具有适应性，但文化语言特定的预训练仍然是实现鲁棒性能的关键，数据集和发现为低资源环境下的文化对齐审核工具开发提供了更强基准。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: 本研究采用过程导向方法，通过约束性决策分析LLMs作为计算作者的创造力，发现模型普遍更重视风格而非其他叙事元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型语言模型创造力的评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用受控提示分配作者角色，分析模型的创意偏好，并探究其选择理由。

Result: LLMs一致强调风格元素，超越角色、事件和场景等其他叙事要素，不同模型展现出独特的创意特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析AI作者创造力提供了新颖的系统性工具，揭示了LLMs在叙事创作中的特定偏好模式。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，通过在用户说话时并行预测工具查询来降低端到端语音对话系统的响应延迟，提高问答准确率200%并减少工具使用延迟20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统虽然能生成更自然、低延迟的响应，但容易产生幻觉且缺乏事实基础。传统文本对话系统通过集成工具解决此问题，但工具集成会增加响应延迟，破坏对话流畅性。

Method: 开发了后训练流程，教导模型在用户说话过程中何时发出工具调用，以及如何生成融合音频查询和检索文本结果的语音摘要。构建了AudioCRAG基准测试数据集。

Result: Streaming RAG方法将QA准确率从11.1%提升至34.2%（相对提升200%），工具使用延迟降低20%。

Conclusion: 提出的流式RAG方法是模态无关的，可应用于输入类型，为更智能、实时的AI助手铺平道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCoT：一种用于双工口语对话系统的流式思维链框架，通过交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应，解决了传统VAD无法区分停顿和对话结束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端口语对话系统依赖语音活动检测进行话轮转换，但VAD无法区分停顿和话轮完成。双工SDS模型通过连续预测输出（包括静音标记）来解决这个问题，但通常具有复杂的双通道架构，在语义推理方面落后于级联模型。

Method: 提出流式思维链框架SCoT，交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应。使用帧级对齐为每个块创建中间目标——对齐的用户转录和系统响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时相比逐轮系统支持更低延迟和重叠交互。

Conclusion: SCoT框架在保持双工系统优势的同时，提升了语义推理能力和响应质量，实现了更自然的人机对话交互。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码技术已成为系统减少大语言模型推理时间的标准方法，但本文发现其速度提升在不同任务间分布不均，特别是在欠拟合和代表性不足任务上效果较差，这引发了公平性担忧。

Method: 通过理论分析量化推测解码的不公平现象，识别导致速度提升差异的因素，并提出一种旨在减少速度提升差异的缓解策略。

Result: 提出的缓解策略在多个模型对上验证有效，公平性指标平均提升了12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码技术存在任务间速度提升不公平的问题，需要专门措施来缓解这种差异，以确保技术应用的公平性。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: RESTRAIN是一种自惩罚强化学习框架，通过利用模型整个答案分布中的信号，在没有黄金标签的情况下实现推理能力的自我提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人工标注数据的强化学习方法成本高昂且在困难任务上表现不佳，需要一种能够从无标签数据中自主学习提升的方法。

Method: 提出RESTRAIN框架，通过自惩罚机制惩罚过度自信的推理路径和低一致性样本，同时保留有希望的推理链，可无缝集成到GRPO等策略优化方法中。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Base和OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base模型上，RESTRAIN在AIME25上提升Pass@1达140.7%，在MMLU_STEM上提升36.2%，在GPQA-Diamond上提升19.6%，几乎达到使用黄金标签训练的效果。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标签实现更强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

TL;DR: 提出了RL4HS强化学习框架，通过span级奖励函数激励推理过程，用于检测大语言模型生成内容中的幻觉片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多将幻觉检测视为二元分类任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉片段，这是一个多步骤决策过程。研究显式推理是否有助于检测幻觉片段。

Method: 首先评估带和不带思维链推理的预训练模型，然后提出RL4HS强化学习框架，基于Group Relative Policy Optimization并引入Class-Aware Policy Optimization来解决奖励不平衡问题。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）上，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用span级奖励的强化学习对于检测幻觉片段是必要的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

TL;DR: 提出基于SPINACH的迭代式Text2SPARQL翻译方法，通过探索-执行循环将自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询，降低知识图谱查询门槛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL查询语言对非计算机背景用户门槛过高，需要降低知识图谱交互难度，响应Text2SPARQL挑战赛的改进需求

Method: 使用LLM支持的SPINACH代理，采用迭代式探索和执行过程而非单次翻译，将自然语言问题逐步转换为SPARQL查询

Result: 开发了完整的系统架构，并对代理行为进行了深入分析，为未来针对性改进提供了见解

Conclusion: 基于LLM的迭代式Text2SPARQL方法能够有效降低知识图谱查询门槛，为领域改进指明了方向

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估过于关注执行准确性而忽视推理过程是否与真实动作对齐，这可能导致用户因看似合理的推理链而过度信任，授权有害行动造成财务损失或信任危机。

Method: 引入真实对齐(GTA)指标，结合精确匹配(EM)共同评估推理准确性和执行准确性，识别两种推理-执行差距：执行差距(EG)和推理差距(RG)。

Result: 实验表明推理-执行差距普遍存在，执行差距比推理差距更常见；扩大模型规模能减少总体差距，但即使在最大模型中执行差距仍然显著。

Conclusion: 该框架可靠反映了最先进模型中的系统性EG/RG模式，为开发更可信的移动智能体提供具体诊断支持。

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

TL;DR: AMPO框架通过自适应多教师指导策略，在LLM推理失败时选择性利用多个教师模型的指导，提升推理多样性和性能，在数学推理任务上比基线提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要依赖自探索或单一教师模型，容易引入模型偏见并限制探索，影响推理多样性和性能。受知识蒸馏中多教师策略启发，需要更有效的指导机制。

Method: 提出AMPO框架：1）自适应多教师指导，仅在学生模型推理失败时提供指导；2）基于理解度的选择机制，让学生学习最可能理解的推理路径；3）平衡广泛探索与有效利用。

Result: 在数学推理任务上比GRPO基线提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%；显著提升Pass@k性能，实现更多样化探索；使用4个同等规模教师即可达到使用单个更强大教师（如DeepSeek-R1）的类似效果。

Conclusion: AMPO提供了一条更高效、可扩展的实现卓越推理和泛化能力的路径，通过"按需指导"策略在保持自我发现价值的同时扩展探索空间。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language

used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for

BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂问题上表现出色，但在简单问题上经常过度推理，生成不必要的冗长推理步骤，影响效率且难以根据问题复杂度调整推理深度。

Method: 引入TECA指标衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出CER机制和"Explore Briefly, Then Decide"推理范式，动态确定最优停止点来结束思考过程。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，该方法显著缓解了过度推理问题，在简单数据集上平均响应长度减少高达71%，同时保持解题能力。

Conclusion: 该方法创建了更高效和自适应的推理过程，有效解决了LLMs的过度推理问题，提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

TL;DR: 提出了InfoMosaic-Bench，这是首个专注于工具增强智能体中多源信息寻求的基准测试，要求智能体将通用搜索与领域特定工具相结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体过度依赖开放网络搜索，存在内容噪声大、不可靠的问题，且许多现实任务需要精确的领域特定知识。虽然MCP协议允许智能体连接数千个专业工具，但尚不清楚智能体是否能有效利用这些工具并与通用搜索结合解决复杂任务。

Method: 开发了InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，涵盖六个代表性领域（医疗、金融、地图、视频、网络和多领域集成），通过InfoMosaic-Flow流程合成任务，确保任务条件基于已验证的工具输出，强制执行跨源依赖，并过滤可通过简单查找解决的捷径案例。

Result: 对14个最先进LLM智能体的实验显示：仅靠网络信息不足（GPT-5准确率仅38.2%，通过率67.5%）；领域工具提供选择性但不一致的益处；22.4%的失败源于工具使用或选择错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在基本工具处理方面仍存在困难，需要改进智能体有效整合多源信息的能力。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

*Wen Yang,Junhong Wu,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出跨语言视角来研究强化学习后训练（RPT）的推理泛化能力，发现英语中心的大推理模型（LRMs）在其他语言上的推理能力转移存在显著差异，并提出了平行训练方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RPT在任务或模态间的泛化，而本研究首次从跨语言角度探讨推理泛化，研究英语RPT获得的推理能力是否能有效转移到其他语言。

Method: 系统评估英语中心LRMs在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言可转移性的指标，通过干预性研究和平行训练实验分析影响因素。

Result: 发现跨语言可转移性因初始模型、目标语言和训练范式而异；提出平行训练方法，发现仅添加一个平行语言就能显著提升性能，且跨语言推理转移遵循幂律缩放规律；识别出单语泛化差距。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LRM推理与人类认知相似的假设，为开发更语言无关的LRMs提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑了当前LLM竞技场评估中将平局视为双方模型实力相等的做法，提出平局更可能反映查询难度而非模型能力相当，并验证了忽略平局评分更新能提高预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Elo评分系统将平局视为双方模型实力相等而进行评分调整，但作者认为平局可能更多反映查询难度而非模型能力相当，需要重新审视这种评分机制。

Method: 在三个真实世界竞技场数据集上，对比了忽略平局评分更新与标准Elo系统的效果，分析了平局与查询难度、客观性的关联。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使四种评分系统的对战结果预测准确率相对提升1-3%，平局更多出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中，风险比分别为1.37和1.35。

Conclusion: 建议未来评分系统重新考虑平局的语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询属性，而不是简单地将平局视为模型能力相等。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Method: 使用半自动数据合成管道生成多样化的运筹学问题-答案对，通过微调Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型，并增强模型调用外部求解器API的能力。

Result: 在三个标准基准测试中达到80.1%执行准确率，比尺寸匹配的基线模型提高4.3%以上；在两种未见过的运筹学问题类型上零样本评估平均准确率为54%，比最强基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: 工具增强的微调方法对于准确且可泛化的运筹学问题建模和求解具有有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

TL;DR: ROTE是一种新算法，通过将日常行为建模为可执行的程序代码而非基于信念和欲望的策略，结合LLM生成行为程序假设空间和概率推理处理不确定性，显著提升了人类行为预测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算量过大难以快速适应，导致数据需求高且脆弱。作者发现日常社交互动往往遵循可预测的'脚本'模式，这些高效模式可以最小化认知负担。

Method: 提出ROTE算法：1) 使用大语言模型合成行为程序的假设空间；2) 采用概率推理在该空间上进行不确定性推理；3) 将行为理解视为程序合成问题，将日常行为建模为计算机代码形式的行为程序。

Result: 在网格世界任务和大规模家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE从稀疏观察中预测人类和AI行为，在样本内准确性和样本外泛化方面比行为克隆和基于LLM的方法高出50%。

Conclusion: 通过将动作理解视为程序合成问题，ROTE为AI系统在现实世界中高效有效地预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在跨学科协作和探索未知问题方面存在局限，需要构建能够自主演化和发现科学知识的智能生态系统。

Method: 集成领域特定知识库、知识增强技术和协作代理，构建多智能体协作系统，特别引入具备本体工程能力的协作代理来提升跨域协作效率。

Result: 知识库增强机制使所有7个专家代理的对话质量评分平均提升10-15%；协作代理的干预使远域专家对的协作效率提升8.5%，而近域专家对仅提升0.8%，揭示出10.6倍的效率差异。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构为化学工程领域的自主科学发现提供了可行路径，但需要解决知识库差距导致的协作效率瓶颈。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体辩论的新型评估框架，用于量化LLM智能体在交互环境中涌现的社会和认知行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM从静态工具转变为自主智能体，传统评估基准无法捕捉智能体在交互环境中沟通、说服和协作时涌现的社会和认知动态。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为受控"社会实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种挑战性话题进行辩论，并采用新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有强大的共识寻求倾向，即使没有明确指令也能达到高语义一致性(μ>0.88)；分配的角色会产生稳定的心理测量特征；主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体环境的新型动态、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了蓝图，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了关键方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Motivation: 现有的上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话场景，但评估动态企业环境中的记忆能力对于其有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过手动专家设计和基于代理的可扩展合成来策划MEMTRACK数据集，生成基于真实软件开发过程的生态有效场景，并引入正确性、效率和冗余性等指标。

Result: 对最先进LLMs和记忆后端的实验显示，在长时程利用记忆、处理跨平台依赖关系和解决矛盾方面存在挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅达到60%的正确性得分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了一个可扩展框架，超越了现有对话设置的关注，为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Motivation: 电子健康记录的快速增长和临床决策复杂性增加，需要数据驱动的决策支持工具来辅助医生，同时不替代医生判断。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，通过分析患者人口统计、症状、诊断和治疗历史等数据生成治疗建议。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法，通过截断推理链来检测隐式奖励黑客行为，在数学推理和编程任务中显著优于现有监控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为（模型利用奖励函数的漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式黑客行为会绕过现有的推理链监控。

Method: TRACE方法通过逐步截断模型的推理链，强制模型在不同长度下回答，并测量验证器通过率。黑客模型会因走捷径而在较短推理链长度下就获得高通过率。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，TRACE比最强的72B推理链监控器提升超过65%；在编程任务中，比32B监控器提升超过30%。还能在训练中发现未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法无效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将推理时检索转化为学习能力：通过蒸馏方法将检索增强生成的优势内化到模型中，避免运行时依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在多步任务中经常出现可预测的失败，如尝试不满足前提条件的动作、发出冗余命令或错误处理环境约束。检索增强生成虽然能提高性能，但需要维护外部知识库并增加计算开销

Method: 提出三步管道：(1)从代理失败中提取紧凑可复用的提示；(2)在回合开始时使用这些提示通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；(3)在移除提示字符串的情况下训练学生模型，强制内化而非记忆

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop两个交互基准测试中，蒸馏学生模型始终优于基线代理，ALFWorld成功率高达91%（基线为79%），WebShop得分提升至72（基线为61），同时比检索增强教师少用10-60%的token

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和代理架构（ReAct/StateAct）上都具有通用性，证明检索优势可以通过有针对性的微调有效内化，无需永久运行时依赖

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

TL;DR: 提出使用LLM代理自动化数据驱动建模和分析的创新流程，在临界热通量预测任务中表现优异，超越传统方法并与专家模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程依赖大规模数据集，传统数据驱动方法需要大量人工干预，难以扩展和泛化。需要自动化建模方法来减少人工工作量。

Method: 评估两种LLM代理框架：多代理协作系统和基于ReAct范式的单代理系统，自动处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化。

Result: 在约25,000个实验数据点的临界热通量预测基准测试中，LLM代理开发的模型超越传统查找表，预测精度和不确定性量化与专家开发的贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当。

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时达到或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoLogX是一个基于大语言模型的自主AI代理，能够将原始系统日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，并映射到MITRE ATT&CK框架，用于提取可操作的网络威胁情报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志是宝贵的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构化、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化等问题，其效用受到限制。需要能够将嘈杂、异构数据协调为连贯且可互操作表示的方法。

Method: OntoLogX集成了轻量级日志本体、检索增强生成和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱在语法和语义上有效。系统将知识图谱聚合到会话级别，并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准测试和真实世界蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，OntoLogX能够跨多个知识图谱后端稳健生成知识图谱，并准确将对抗活动映射到ATT&CK战术。检索和校正机制提高了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 基于本体的表示为可操作的网络威胁情报提取提供了价值，代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中表现有效，检索和校正机制对精确率和召回率有显著益处。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM智能推理与轻量级代理模型的可扩展知识挖掘框架，能在保持高准确率的同时显著降低推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识挖掘中LLM部署成本过高与传统分类器/抽取器泛化能力不足的问题

Method: 使用LLM作为规划器和标注器，将用户指令分解为可执行管道并生成监督数据训练小型代理模型，统一分类和抽取为两个原子操作

Result: Falconer在指令跟随准确率上接近最先进LLM，同时减少90%推理成本，加速大规模知识挖掘20倍以上

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了高效可扩展的基础框架

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Conclusion: 领域专家的精炼知识在开发教育AI系统中具有重要作用，能够帮助创建更有效的辅导系统和更高效的学习体验。

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE是一种新颖的视觉不确定性引导探索方法，通过将图像视为随机上下文，量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，有效提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态输入时，将视觉输入视为固定确定性条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的模糊性，导致策略对合理视觉变化的鲁棒性不足。

Method: VOGUE将探索从输出（文本）空间转移到输入（视觉）空间，通过对称KL散度量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样调度来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能并缓解了RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是改进多模态推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着政府对AI的监管加强，需要评估LLM在判断AI系统是否符合AI法规方面的能力，但目前缺乏相应的基准测试工具。

Method: 通过两步流程创建数据集：(1)使用结构化指令提示LLM生成120个虚构但合理的AI系统技术文档样本；(2)法律专家审查并标注每个样本是否违反AI法案的具体条款。

Result: 创建了包含专家标注的合规标签的数据集，并评估了前沿LLM在重现专家合规判断方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该数据集为理解基于LLM的AI法规合规评估工具的机遇和限制提供了起点，并为后续LLM的比较建立了基准。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LToT是一种改进的Tree-of-Thoughts搜索控制器，通过分离效用和逻辑一致性，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费，解决了广度饱和和深度近视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试时计算存在两个问题：广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度近视（噪声短期效用修剪了需要更多步骤才能显现回报的分支）。

Method: LToT将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和侧线（一致但初始低效用的候选）。通过侧向竞赛与短路机制（LR--SC）探索侧线，使用有上限的连续减半竞赛在宽侧线集上分布微小探测，并在分支超过主线阈值时立即提升。

Result: 理论证明侧向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀log_ηN₀)，与无上限主线的指数增长形成对比。实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: LToT将大量测试时预算转化为有原则的多样性，同时保持提升纪律，在不增加计算量的情况下缓解饱和和近视问题。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器和聚类技术的方法，用于分析大语言模型的内部token表示，并在数学推理任务中指导生成过程。该方法通过构建token转移图来平衡利用和探索，提高推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在数学推理任务中如何平衡利用已知推理路径和探索新路径的问题，需要一种能够量化推理轨迹质量并指导生成过程的方法。

Method: 首先训练稀疏自编码器生成token的稀疏向量表示，然后使用k-means聚类构建token转移图，其中顶点代表token簇，加权边捕获序列token转移。基于边权重定义奖励函数来量化推理轨迹的遵循程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对于数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要。稀疏自编码器可以作为可扩展的奖励模型来指导生成，确保利用和探索之间的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够防止极端行为，促进大语言模型中更高质量的推理过程，通过平衡利用已知推理路径和探索新路径来提高数学推理的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域如法律和医学中，高保证推理需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论。这些推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编码的前提，由于众多例外而涉及可废止或非单调逻辑，单个事实的引入可能使一般规则失效，这带来了重大挑战。

Method: 提出LOGicalThought (LogT) 神经符号架构，使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文，将长文本指南推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中，LogT比四个基线模型整体性能提升11.84%。在三种推理模式上均有显著改进：否定推理提升高达+10.2%，蕴含推理提升+13.2%，可废止推理提升+5.5%。

Conclusion: LogT架构通过神经符号方法有效解决了高保证文本指南中的严格推理挑战，特别是在处理否定、蕴含和可废止规则等复杂逻辑结构方面表现出色。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划智能体虽然解决了观测不确定性，但往往忽略了其内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，这在信息不完整和动态嘈杂的实际环境中限制了问题解决能力。

Method: InfoSeeker提示LLM通过规划行动来主动收集信息，验证其理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在包含部分可观测环境和不确定动态的新基准套件上，InfoSeeker相比先前方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率。在机器人操作和网页导航等基准测试中也优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在部分可观测环境中紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为的重要性。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

TL;DR: 提出了Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO)算法，通过过程奖励函数来改进扩散语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，解决现有方法中存在的非结构化精炼问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的扩散语言模型训练方法依赖稀疏的、基于结果的奖励，这会强化导致偶然正确结果的错误推理路径。这源于与推理自然结构的基本不匹配。

Method: 首先提出了一个理论框架，将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程。然后引入SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数来引导模型学习结构化的推理路径，使去噪过程与潜在推理层次对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种原则性方法在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中显著提高了性能，并增强了生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: SAPO通过将推理过程形式化为层次选择，并使用过程奖励来引导模型学习结构化推理路径，有效解决了扩散语言模型在复杂推理任务中的训练挑战。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Result: 1) 安全性改进随模型规模扩展更强 2) 减轻安全税，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力 3) 在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律、勒索、谋杀等）比SafetyPrompt等基线方法减少15.7%有害回答

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了可扩展和泛化的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL是一个协同进化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过内部化安全性到任务智能体中，解决LLM多智能体系统的安全漏洞问题，无需依赖外部防护模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统在规划、工具使用和角色协调方面表现出色，但其开放性和交互复杂性使其容易受到越狱、提示注入和对抗性协作攻击。现有防御方法存在性能不足或系统开销大的问题。

Method: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，通过对抗学习环境联合优化攻击者（合成进化越狱提示）和防御者（训练任务智能体既完成任务又抵抗攻击），引入公共基线进行优势估计以稳定学习和促进协作。

Result: 在代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL持续将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法可达38.33%，同时保持甚至提高任务准确率（推理任务最高提升3.67%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明安全性和实用性可以共同提升，无需依赖额外的防护智能体或增加系统开销。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估LLM是否具备担任心理咨询师所需的专业知识和资格。

Method: 开发PsychoBench基准，包含2,252个精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家咨询师认证考试，涵盖心理学各个子学科，要求深度理解和广泛知识。

Result: 先进模型如GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B显著超过通过阈值（约70%准确率），而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于该阈值。

Conclusion: 只有前沿的大型语言模型目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这突显了开发心理学导向LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文环境中泛化能力差，导致计算量过大和性能不稳定，需要更高效的上下文处理方法。

Method: 使用大语言模型进行信息论摘要，将上下文输入压缩为低维语义丰富的摘要，基于近似上下文充分性概念构建理论框架。

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率和样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的摘要为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能够理解道路网络地图并执行导航任务，探索其在真实世界轨迹恢复和路径规划方面的潜力。

Method: 提出轨迹恢复作为代理任务，构建GLOBALTRACE数据集（包含4000+真实轨迹），使用道路网络作为上下文，设计提示框架让LLMs生成路径而不依赖外部导航工具。

Result: LLMs在轨迹恢复任务中优于现成基线和专业轨迹恢复模型，具有强大的零样本泛化能力，但存在区域和交通模式的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对道路网络和坐标系统的良好理解能力，能够通过灵活的地图推理来增强导航体验并整合用户偏好。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了计算机使用代理(CUAs)存在盲目目标导向(BGD)的偏见，即不顾可行性、安全性或上下文而追求目标。作者开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，评估了9个前沿模型，发现平均BGD率高达80.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和量化计算机使用代理中存在的盲目目标导向风险，这种风险可能导致代理执行不安全、不可行或与上下文不符的操作。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务，基于OSWorld提供真实环境，使用LLM评估代理行为，并与人工标注达到93.75%的一致性。评估了9个前沿模型。

Result: 所有测试模型都表现出高BGD率(平均80.8%)，揭示了三种主要失败模式：执行优先偏见、思维-行动脱节和请求优先性。基于提示的干预措施能降低BGD水平，但风险依然显著。

Conclusion: BGD暴露了计算机使用代理的潜在风险，即使输入不直接有害也会出现。需要更强的训练或推理时干预措施来确保CUA的安全部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Motivation: 患者在接受侵入性手术前常有未解答的问题，但时间紧迫的工作流程和隐私限制限制了个性化咨询。

Method: 使用句子转换器分类器路由输入，从临床医生策划的FAQ返回原文答案，避免临床路径中的自由文本生成。在两个领域（拔牙和胃镜检查）使用专家评审验证集进行阈值设定和独立测试集评估。

Result: E5-large-instruct编码器总体准确率为0.983，AUC为0.996，仅有7个错误，与GPT-4o在统计上无差异。非生成临床路径每输入消耗约1.0 mWh，比本地8B SLM的小对话回复低约170倍，同时保持约0.10秒延迟。

Conclusion: 通过返回经过审核的FAQ原文答案，在临床路径中结构性地避免了前沿判别和生成引起的错误，支持在带宽受限环境中的隐私、可持续性和公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要依赖基于人类直觉设计的合成任务，这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估框架来证明AGI能力。

Method: 提出基于数据科学实践的替代设计哲学，重点关注稳健任务执行能力的评估，通过展示系统可靠部署来证明AGI能力。

Conclusion: AGI评估应从直觉驱动的合成任务转向基于能力的稳健执行评估，借鉴数据科学方法更有效地证明AGI系统的实际部署价值。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Motivation: 现有的偏好微调方法忽视了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声，需要一种能够产生高质量负样本的方法来更好地对齐人类偏好。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架，生成具有目标错误的拒绝响应，同时保持与接受响应在风格和长度上的相似性，构建了包含30K高质量样本的VaPR数据集。

Result: 在三个LVLM家族上微调后，在十个基准测试中平均性能提升6.5%(LLaVA)、4.0%(Qwen2VL)和1.5%(Qwen2.5VL)，推理任务表现显著改善，并减少了二元问题中回答"是"的倾向。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好标注的噪声问题，显著提升模型性能，且该框架可推广到开源LLM作为编辑器，性能接近使用GPT-4o合成的效果。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

TL;DR: MetaboT是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体AI系统，能够将用户的自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询语言，用于操作代谢组学知识图谱，显著提高了查询准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代谢组学质谱数据庞大复杂，知识图谱虽然能结构化这些数据，但需要用户深入理解其本体论和查询语言语法，这构成了技术障碍。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，使用LangChain和LangGraph库构建，包含入口代理、验证代理、监督代理、知识图谱代理和SPARQL查询代理，通过分工协作处理用户查询。

Result: 在50个代谢组学相关问题的测试中，MetaboT达到83.67%的准确率，而仅使用GPT-4o的基线方法仅达到8.16%的准确率。

Conclusion: MetaboT成功消除了访问知识图谱的技术障碍，通过自然语言查询实现了结构化代谢组学数据的检索，为数据驱动发现提供了便利。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLMs的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLMs提炼CoT为紧凑的高层指导进行SFT，第二阶段引入指导感知的RL方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs的推理过程受限于自回归token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确。现有方法如树算法和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: PTA-GRPO两阶段框架：1）使用高级LLMs将CoT提炼为紧凑高层指导进行监督微调；2）引入指导感知的RL方法，联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型（Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B、LLaMA3.2-3B）上实验，PTA-GRPO均获得稳定显著改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO能有效提升LLMs的推理能力，在不同模型和任务上表现出良好的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

*Claudio Fanconi,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文将对抗性逆强化学习应用于大语言模型推理，学习密集的令牌级奖励模型用于过程监督，而非通过监督微调模仿风格。该推理奖励在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评者对采样轨迹进行重排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新构建和操作对抗性逆强化学习，直接从专家演示中学习密集的令牌级奖励模型，优先考虑正确性而非表面形式，实现推理过程中的错误定位。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习方法，学习密集的令牌级推理奖励模型。该奖励模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评者对采样轨迹进行重排序。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络验证：密集推理奖励可作为学习信号激发推理，通过奖励引导的重排序提高了预测性能（特别是基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时选择和令牌级诊断统一到单个推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级奖励具有增强语言模型中多步推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CARS方法，在保持语言模型分布不变的前提下，通过自适应剪枝提高约束生成的采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪约束解码会扭曲模型分布，而拒绝采样浪费计算资源丢弃无效输出。在程序模糊测试等需要有效性和多样性的领域中，这两种极端都有问题

Method: CARS从无约束采样开始，通过记录违反约束的延续到trie中，并从未来采样中减去其概率质量，自适应地排除无效延续。这种自适应剪枝确保已证明无效的前缀不会被重新访问

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS始终实现更高的效率（以每个有效样本的LM前向传递次数衡量），同时比GCD和近似LM分布的方法产生更强的样本多样性

Conclusion: CARS严格提高了拒绝采样的样本效率，而不产生分布扭曲，接受率单调提高，生成的样本精确遵循约束分布

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM与人类集体决策对齐的框架，通过Lost at Sea实验发现不同LLM在集体推理中表现出不同的偏差模式，对齐程度取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是集体层面的对齐，而非仅关注个体层面。

Method: 使用Lost at Sea社会心理学任务进行大规模在线实验(N=748)，随机分配组别进行领导者选举，比较可见人口属性与匿名别名条件，并模拟匹配的LLM组进行基准测试。

Result: LLM行为出现分化：有些镜像人类偏见，有些则掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI在集体推理中的对齐取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏差。

Conclusion: 理解LLM如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一个确定性模拟框架，为评估AI生成的同行评审报告提供首个稳定的证据标准，通过分析352份模拟报告识别出可靠系统状态指标，证明该系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断并保持程序完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临不可管理的投稿量和不受监管的AI双重危机，需要新的治理模式来保障科学完整性。传统纯人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准，使编辑过程不透明且难以审计。

Method: 开发确定性模拟框架，分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标。系统模拟校准的编辑判断，动态适应领域特定规范，并强制执行稳定的证据锚定合规率。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决策在所有学科中始终占多数结果(>50%)，'拒绝'率在健康科学领域动态适应至45%。系统保持坚定的程序完整性，强制执行稳定的29%证据锚定合规率，在不同评审任务和科学领域中保持不变。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了一个可预测的规则约束系统，减轻了生成式AI的随机性。为科学界提供确保公平的透明工具，为出版策略师提供可扩展的工作流审计、完整性风险管理和基于证据的治理工具，将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: ReTabAD通过恢复表格数据的文本语义来解决现有异常检测基准缺乏语义上下文的问题，提供了包含丰富文本元数据的20个数据集和多种检测算法实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准只提供原始数据点而缺乏语义上下文，忽略了特征描述和领域知识等关键文本元数据，限制了模型充分利用领域知识进行检测的能力。

Method: 构建了20个包含结构化文本元数据的表格数据集，实现了包括经典方法、深度学习和基于LLM的方法在内的最先进异常检测算法，并提出了无需任务特定训练的零样本LLM框架。

Result: 实验结果表明语义上下文能够提高检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理来增强可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知的异常检测建立了基准，展示了文本元数据在异常检测中的重要价值和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对LLM深度层利用的系统性研究表明，深层贡献因评估设置而异：基于似然的评估中浅层关键，而生成式评估中深层对推理和连贯性不可或缺。


<details>

Motivation: 针对现有研究认为LLM深层贡献有限的观点，通过多维度系统分析验证深度利用的异质性和上下文依赖性。

Method: 在不同评估协议、任务类别和模型架构下系统研究深度利用，包括基于似然和生成的评估方法。

Result: 知识检索集中在浅层，推理准确性依赖深层但可通过蒸馏重塑；深度利用高度异质且依赖上下文。

Conclusion: LLM深度利用高度异质且依赖上下文，需要在解释和压缩大模型时考虑任务、指标和模型感知的视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

*Claas Beger,Ryan Yi,Shuhao Fu,Arseny Moskvichev,Sarah W. Tsai,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，虽然某些AI模型在文本模态下能达到人类水平的ARC-AGI基准准确率，但其抽象推理能力被高估，因为模型往往依赖表面模式而非真正的抽象推理；在视觉模态下，模型准确率下降但可能被低估，因为它们确实能识别抽象概念但难以正确应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI模型在ConceptARC任务中的抽象推理能力，探究模型是否真正理解任务设计者意图的抽象概念，而非仅依赖表面模式。

Method: 在ConceptARC上评估模型，改变输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用Python工具、推理模型的推理努力程度，同时评估模型生成的自然语言规则来解释解决方案。

Result: 文本模态下最佳模型的规则常基于表面"捷径"，很少捕捉到预期抽象概念；视觉模态下模型准确率大幅下降，但规则分析显示它们仍能识别相当比例的预期抽象概念，只是难以正确应用。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理方面仍落后于人类，仅凭准确率评估ARC类任务的抽象推理能力可能会高估文本模态的能力而低估视觉模态的能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: FlexDoc是一个可扩展的合成数据生成框架，通过随机模式和参数化采样生成多语言半结构化文档，显著降低了文档理解模型的数据收集和标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大规模、多样化的标注数据集，但传统数据收集方法面临隐私限制、法律约束和高昂的人工标注成本（可达数百万美元）。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模多样化文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务上，FlexDoc生成的数据将绝对F1分数提高了11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少了90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在生产环境中部署，显著加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时大幅降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Result: 实验证实主流DRAs在复杂开放任务上优于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但仍存在显著的改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构改进和范式进步提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部护栏、推理时引导、训练后对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限性，需要更动态和模块化的安全控制方法。

Method: 识别安全关键层并上循环为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软护栏选择性激活原始MLP和安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略；引入安全温度机制实现推理时动态控制。

Conclusion: 为LLM安全提供了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

TL;DR: RLVR方法在提升大语言模型推理能力时反而会缩小推理边界，研究发现存在负干扰和赢家通吃现象，导致Pass@k性能下降。作者提出针对低概率问题的数据筛选算法来改善效果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RLVR方法为何会缩小推理边界而非扩展它，揭示其学习动态中的关键问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和在多个数学推理基准上的实证研究，识别RLVR中的负干扰和赢家通吃现象，并提出针对低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 发现RLVR存在负干扰（学习某些问题会降低其他问题的正确率）和赢家通吃现象（过度强化高概率问题），导致Pass@k性能下降。提出的数据筛选算法显著改善了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的失败源于标准RL目标中的固有策略采样，使模型收敛到狭窄的解决策略。通过关注低概率问题的数据筛选可以有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at
https://github.com/mail-research/SELF-llm-interference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN)方法，通过生成多个执行轨迹并使用行为叙事进行选择，显著提高了计算机使用代理在复杂任务中的成功率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长期复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个执行轨迹，并使用描述代理执行过程的行为叙事来进行轨迹选择，实现广泛探索和原则性选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的新SOTA，显著优于先前方法，接近人类72%的性能水平，并在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上展示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 有效扩展计算机使用代理需要结构化的轨迹理解和选择，bBoN为实现这一目标提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

TL;DR: 提出RLAD方法，通过推理抽象来引导模型学习有效的推理过程，使用两玩家RL训练范式联合训练抽象生成器和解决方案生成器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型模型在推理过程中往往无法一致地捕获或重用过程，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型能够为问题提出多个抽象描述，然后使用RL激励在利用这些抽象信息的基础上构建解决方案

Result: RLAD方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效引导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有益于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Motivation: 生物信号模态间存在相关性，但标注数据有限且基础模型计算开销大，需要高效的跨模态知识迁移方法。

Method: 使用轻量级桥接网络对齐基础模型的中间表示，提出高效的对齐位置选择策略和灵活的原型网络作为桥接架构。

Result: 在多个生物信号模态、任务和数据集上的实验显示，BioX-Bridge将可训练参数减少88-99%，同时保持或优于现有方法的迁移性能。

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge为生物信号的无监督跨模态知识迁移提供了一种高效解决方案，显著降低了计算和内存开销。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 物理知识的融入显著提升了原子轨迹预测的可靠性和精度，为昂贵的DFT模拟提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温度采样虽然能增加语言模型输出的多样性，但在需要高精度的数学推理任务中会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样到错误续写。

Method: 选择性采样方法基于采样风险指标动态切换贪婪采样和高温采样。通过在小规模可验证问题上训练轻量级分类器来预测采样风险，该分类器可与基础语言模型集成且延迟开销最小。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高温采样在精度敏感任务中的准确性问题，实现了更好的多样性和准确性平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料发现受限于缺乏大规模、机器可读的耦合性能指标与结构背景的数据集，现有数据库要么规模小、手动策展，要么偏向第一性原理结果，实验文献未被充分利用。

Result: 在50篇策展论文上基准测试显示，GPT-4.1达到最高准确率（热电性能F1=0.91，结构字段F1=0.82），GPT-4.1 Mini性能接近但成本大幅降低。最终策展了27,822条温度解析属性记录。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了最大的LLM策展热电数据集，建立了可重复且成本分析的数据提取流程，为超越热电领域的可扩展、数据驱动的材料发现奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Motivation: 大型语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法面临无约束方向误差和次优比特分配两大问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个几何驱动创新：1）误差方向敏感度引导（EDSG），利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感度方向；2）权重通道敏感度引导（WCSG），通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B的2比特量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度上领先基线方法0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

Conclusion: RheOFormer作为一种稳健的神经代理模型，可加速预测性复杂流体模拟，推进数据驱动实验，并在广泛应用中实现实时过程优化。

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知深度Q网络集成多信号证据进行客户端信任更新。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上实验显示：准确率稳步提升；客户端重叠增加能提高准确率并降低攻击成功率；信号预算减少时准确率稳定但攻击成功率上升；DQN在鲁棒性-准确性权衡上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 序列信念更新能缓解弱信号问题，DQN控制器在联邦学习防御中实现了最优的鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过为每个单元分配本地流量预算（活动率与扇出的乘积），在全局流量预算约束下最大化编码熵，实现选择性-受众平衡的剪枝策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于参数对损失的影响（如幅度或梯度）进行剪枝，而BB方法旨在通过最大化编码熵和减少相关性来学习更多样化和高效的表示。

Method: BB为每个单元分配本地流量预算（a_i × k_i），通过约束熵分析推导出选择性-受众平衡公式，并使用简单的本地执行器剪枝扇入（降低活动率）或扇出（减少广播）。

Result: BB在ASR的Transformer、人脸识别的ResNet和突触预测的3D U-Net中，在相同稀疏度下提高了编码熵、减少相关性并改善准确率，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上达到了最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径，通过本地流量预算实现有效的网络剪枝。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive

TL;DR: RLP是一种在预训练阶段引入强化学习的信息驱动强化预训练目标，通过将思维链视为探索性动作，基于信息增益计算奖励，鼓励模型在预测前独立思考，显著提升数学和科学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式在预训练阶段仅使用下一个词预测损失，而强化学习只在最后的微调阶段引入。作者质疑这种方式的优化性，希望将强化学习的探索精神更早地引入到预训练中。

Method: 提出RLP目标，将思维链视为探索性动作，奖励信号基于思维链提供的未来词预测信息增益计算。具体计算在给定上下文和采样推理链条件下下一个词的对数似然与仅给定上下文条件下的差值。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上使用RLP预训练，在8个数学和科学基准测试中平均提升19%。在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上，整体平均从42.81%提升到61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新定义为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个词预测与有用思维链推理出现之间的差距，证明了在预训练阶段引入强化学习的有效性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Motivation: 在结合基于势能的架构和退化变分积分器时，学习模型有时会因方案的规范依赖性而数值不稳定，导致长时间模拟无法进行。

Method: 提出两种训练策略：直接学习向量场，或通过方案学习时间离散动力学。

Result: 通过多个数值测试案例评估了方法学习复杂物理动力学的能力，如回旋动力学等离子体物理中的引导中心。

Conclusion: 识别了学习非规范哈密顿动力学时的数值不稳定问题，并提出了有效的解决方案，使长时间模拟成为可能。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和RL的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，解决了RL训练期间的安全风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的LQR控制需要繁琐的系统辨识，而纯RL方法在训练期间可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制效果好，因此提出混合框架。

Method: 使用基于随机选择模型的LQR控制器来指导RL控制器训练，保持整体框架的无模型特性，同时降低RL探索风险。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了纯RL实现中的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究，为模型无关的结构振动控制提供了安全有效的途径。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Motivation: 理解RNN的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但现有方法在识别信息传递关键节点方面存在不足。

Method: 使用信息论方法量化节点间互信息，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU等架构，同时进行节点敲除实验验证功能重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅加深了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架，通过非对比学习解决PU学习中表示学习困难的问题，无需辅助信息即可在复杂数据集上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上表现远逊于监督学习方法，主要瓶颈在于不可靠监督下难以学习判别性表示

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比监督损失(NoiSNCL)和幻影标签消歧(PLD)方案，前者对齐类内表示，后者提供保守负监督

Result: 在多种数据集上显著超越现有PU方法，包括灾害后建筑损毁映射等实际应用场景

Conclusion: NcPU框架有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈，为实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动现象获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望通过轻量级扰动来揭示LLM的潜在错误信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过分析模型对扰动的响应来检测错误行为。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测事实性、安全性、毒性及后门攻击等各类错误，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLM已编码了检测自身错误的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思想自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-驱逐策略显著减少大模型推理时的GPU内存占用，同时保持接近无损的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成虽然支持扩展的思维链，但也导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性识别不同重要性的思想类型，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，根据思想重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演化逐步驱逐不太重要的思想中的token。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，ThinKV仅使用不到5%的原始KV缓存就实现了接近无损的精度，推理吞吐量比最先进基线提高了5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思想自适应压缩有效解决了KV缓存内存爆炸问题，实现了高效的大模型推理。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强模型可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进了机器学习技术在真实交通系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational

shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

Method: 基于量子光学方法构建无限族拓扑非平凡流形，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，创建QuIIEst基准。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更严格的测试环境，揭示了现有方法在复杂流形上的局限性，并展示了在非流形空间（如分形）中提取有效维度的能力。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估数据集对称性假设的方法，通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来量化数据集中的各向异性程度，揭示了基准点云数据集中存在的高度对齐现象，并表明分布对称性破缺可能阻碍不变方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"。本文旨在批判性评估这一假设，开发量化数据集各向异性程度的方法。

Method: 提出了一种通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来量化数据集各向异性的指标，该指标能够区分原始数据集与其随机增强等价版本。在合成数据集上验证了该指标，并将其应用于基准点云数据集分析。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐现象；理论分析表明分布对称性破缺可能阻碍不变方法的最优性能，即使在标签真正不变的情况下；实证发现等变方法在部分各向异性数据集上仍有益处，但在其他数据集上则无。

Conclusion: 理解等变性（包括其何时有效及原因）可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差，对称感知方法的有效性具有数据集依赖性。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

*Kiwhan Song,Jaeyeon Kim,Sitan Chen,Yilun Du,Sham Kakade,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了选择性欠拟合的概念，认为更好的扩散模型在输入空间的某些区域更准确地逼近分数函数，而在其他区域则欠拟合，这对于理解扩散模型的泛化能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在训练时学习分数函数用于生成样本，但存在一个基本问题：它们实际学习的是哪个分数？如果完全匹配经验分数，模型只会复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Method: 引入选择性欠拟合概念，通过经验干预验证该观点，并分析扩散模型在输入空间不同区域的分数逼近行为。

Result: 研究发现更好的扩散模型在特定区域更准确地逼近分数函数，而在其他区域欠拟合，这种选择性欠拟合对模型性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化和生成性能的关键，为研究扩散模型提供了新的可测试见解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，可在推理时对掩码扩散模型进行自校正，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力来检测和修正低质量token，但现有方法要么需要重构MDM架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的token质量代理，限制了应用性。

Method: PRISM定义了一个自校正损失，可证明地学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。这些质量分数与MDM在同一前向传播中计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上推进了MDM推理：数独、无条件文本（170M）以及使用LLaDA的代码（8B）。

Conclusion: PRISM为掩码扩散模型提供了一种有效的推理时自校正方法，具有理论保证和实证效果。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成中输出质量与推理成本之间的平衡问题，特别是在需要多次生成时优化效率。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个成本随机的"盒子"，开发UCB风格的潘多拉盒算法，并通过Bradley-Terry变换处理不同提示间的奖励缩放问题。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，但平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 建立了最优停止理论与推理时缩放之间的原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Motivation: 传统自由能重构方法如高斯过程回归需要集体变量的雅可比矩阵，这限制了复杂或机器学习集体变量的使用。

Method: 使用神经网络代理框架直接从笛卡尔坐标学习集体变量，并通过自动微分计算雅可比矩阵。

Result: 在MgCl2离子配对系统中，该方法对简单距离集体变量和复杂配位数集体变量都实现了高精度，雅可比矩阵误差接近高斯分布。

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Method: 在带向量量化的自编码器中引入低秩表示，通过对学习到的潜在表示执行一系列计算高效的低秩操作来重建数据。

Result: 该方法大幅减少了神经压缩/重建中解码阶段的计算开销，基本消除了解码器计算瓶颈，同时保持高保真度的图像输出。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

*Dorsa Soleymani,Ali Dadsetan,Frank Rudzicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SoftAdaClip方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代DP-SGD中的硬梯度裁剪，在保持差分隐私的同时显著减少子群体间的不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号，导致模型性能和公平性下降，特别是对代表性不足的群体。

Method: SoftAdaClip方法使用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感度的同时保留相对梯度幅度，并结合自适应机制。

Result: 在MIMIC-III、GOSSIS-eICU和Adult Income等数据集上，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD将子群体差异减少高达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少高达48%，且这些减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Local Linear Attention (LLA)，一种基于非参数统计理论的新型注意力机制，通过测试时回归视角推导而来。LLA在理论分析和实际任务中展现出优于线性注意力和Softmax注意力的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Softmax Attention的高效替代方案已被广泛研究，但基于理论洞察、即使计算成本更高的更具表达力的机制研究相对不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1. 从非参数统计角度提出Local Linear Attention (LLA)机制
2. 开发FlashLLA算法，实现硬件高效的块状并行计算
3. 实现定制化推理内核以减少内存开销
4. 通过偏差-方差权衡分析理论优势

Result: 实验结果表明，LLA能有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，并展现出在大规模模型中可扩展性和适用性的潜力。

Conclusion: LLA通过理论推导和高效实现，为注意力机制提供了新的研究方向，在多个任务中表现出优越性能，并为大规模应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

TL;DR: SCOPED是一种快速通用的OOD检测方法，用于扩散模型，通过结合雅可比迹和评分函数平方范数，大幅减少前向传播次数，在多个视觉基准测试中达到竞争性或最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对于机器学习系统在视觉、机器人、强化学习等领域的可靠部署至关重要，需要快速且通用的检测方法。

Method: SCOPED结合雅可比迹和评分函数平方范数形成单一测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需单次前向传播和一次雅可比向量积。

Result: 在四个视觉基准测试中，SCOPED以低计算成本实现了竞争性或最先进的精度-召回分数，并在机器人控制任务中成功识别跨奖励函数和训练机制的分布偏移。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域中的快速可靠OOD检测提供了实用基础，适用于视觉感知伪影、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集管理。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

Motivation: 研究合成数据在基于模型的强化学习中的有效性，解释为什么MBPO在OpenAI Gym中表现良好但在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳，揭示环境特定假设如何影响算法设计。

Method: 分析MBPO算法在两种环境中的性能差异，识别动态模型与奖励模型尺度不匹配、目标表示选择不当等失败模式，并针对这些问题提出改进方案。

Result: 通过解决识别出的失败模式，MBPO在7个DeepMind Control Suite任务中的5个任务中超越了SAC，同时保持了在OpenAI Gym中的良好性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发将MDP任务和环境结构与算法失败模式联系起来的分类法的重要性，追求统一解决方案，并澄清基准选择如何影响算法泛化条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Conclusion: 研究为在噪声条件下开发符合人类偏好的AI系统提供了重要见解，强调了考虑现实噪声因素在LLM对齐中的必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致：在一个设置中有效的在线微调设计选择在另一个设置中可能完全失败。本文旨在解释这种不一致性。

Method: 提出了稳定性-可塑性原则，识别了三种在线微调机制，每种机制需要不同的稳定性特性。通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中的45个案例中，实证结果与该框架的预测高度一致。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

*Hengyi Zhu,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，解决了传统方法的探索偏差问题，在保证精度的同时显著降低了延迟和搜索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网方法需要多个GPU天，而基于LLM的方法存在探索偏差，无法在整个搜索空间中发现不同延迟范围的架构。

Method: 1) 基于复杂度的分区引擎；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子；3) 零成本预测器避免从头训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟降低达54%，搜索成本从几天降至几分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过创新的搜索空间分区和提示协同进化策略，有效解决了LLM驱动的NAS中的探索偏差问题，实现了高效、低成本的硬件感知神经架构搜索。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常被对抗性投毒、系统错误或低质量样本污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降，需要鲁棒的学习方法。

Method: 使用小型干净参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比率，对密度比率进行裁剪后作为权重用于行为克隆目标，优先学习干净专家行为。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染率下仍保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的加权BC方法能有效抵御数据集污染，具有理论保证和实际有效性，无需了解污染机制即可实现鲁棒学习。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了对抗性攻击可转移性的关键区别：数据空间攻击可以成功转移，而表示空间攻击通常无法转移，除非模型表示几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在模型间成功转移，而视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论证明和四个实验验证：1) 数学证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；2) 构建图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3) 构建语言模型的表示空间越狱攻击；4) 构建视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击和表示空间对齐实验。

Result: 数据空间攻击成功转移，表示空间攻击无法转移（除非表示几何对齐），证实了攻击可转移性取决于操作域（共享数据空间 vs 独特表示空间）。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移并非所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有重要启示。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Motivation: 标准多数投票平等对待所有答案，忽略了模型间的潜在异质性和相关性，需要更有效的聚合方法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：最优权重(OW)和逆惊喜流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息来改进聚合效果。

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM微调基准测试和真实医疗场景中，新方法均一致优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP算法能够缓解多数投票的固有局限性，为构建鲁棒的多智能体LLM管道提供了实用性能提升和概念洞见。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Motivation: 解决强化学习在临床决策支持系统中因不可操作给药决策而受到从业者质疑的挑战，特别是在ICU脓毒症休克患者的血管加压药管理方面。

Method: 采用动作空间设计，结合离散、连续和定向给药策略，使用离线保守Q学习和新型循环建模来捕捉ICU时间序列数据的时序依赖性。

Conclusion: 设计的动作空间提高了可解释性并促进了临床采用，同时保持了治疗效果，表明动作空间设计在临床强化学习应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱基础模型(KGFMs)的确定性等变性限制了表达能力，无法区分结构相似但语义不同的关系

Method: 引入概率节点关系等变性，通过随机游走采样、序列编码、序列模型嵌入和学习池化来聚合节点和关系表示

Result: 在诊断数据集Petals上完美解决现有KGFMs失败的问题，在54个知识图谱的关系预测任务上达到最优性能

Conclusion: Flock模型通过概率等变性突破了传统KGFMs的表达限制，是知识图谱同构不变链接级函数的通用逼近器

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保食品生产动物用药安全对保护动物福利和人类食品安全至关重要，需要预测不良事件结果以降低食品链中违规残留风险。

Method: 构建数据预处理管道整合关系表，通过VeDDRA本体标准化不良事件，集成药物理化性质，评估多种监督学习模型，处理类别不平衡问题，使用集成方法和AUM伪标签技术。

Result: 集成方法和CatBoost表现最佳，精确度、召回率和F1分数达到0.95，SHAP分析识别出与致命结果相关的生物学合理预测因子。

Conclusion: 结合严格数据工程、先进机器学习和可解释AI能够准确预测兽医安全结果，支持早期检测高风险药物事件特征，加强残留风险评估。

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

TL;DR: CarbonX是一个基于时间序列基础模型的开源工具，用于碳强度预测和插补等脱碳任务，仅需历史碳强度数据即可在全球214个电网实现零样本预测，MAPE为15.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三个主要限制：需要特定电网的电力结构数据、依赖独立的电网特定模型难以提供全球覆盖、缺乏不确定性估计。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，支持零样本预测和插补任务。

Result: 在214个全球电网中零样本预测MAPE为15.82%；在13个基准电网中平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%，提供95%覆盖率的预测区间；可提供长达21天的预测；在插补任务上优于统计基线1.2-3.9倍。

Conclusion: CarbonX能在数据有限的情况下在任何电网使用并提供强大性能，是实用的全球规模脱碳工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

TL;DR: 提出了两种改进二值神经网络验证的整数规划方法：新的多类别线性目标函数和利用BNN递归结构的有效不等式生成技术，显著提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值神经网络的验证问题通常被建模为整数规划问题，但传统方法存在大M约束导致的整数间隙问题，限制了验证效率。

Method: 1. 为多类别分类场景设计了新的线性目标函数；2. 利用BNN的递归结构生成有效不等式来改进整数规划公式。

Result: 相比现有IP方法，新方法在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 提出的两种技术显著改善了二值神经网络的验证效率，为BNN的鲁棒性评估提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型缺乏双向一致性，例如能够成功描述分子结构但无法从自身生成的文本准确重建原始结构，这表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用双向转换的成功作为奖励信号来训练模型；提出迭代变体，其中前向和反向映射交替训练彼此，形成自改进循环。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下显著提升了性能和一致性，优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 双向一致性不仅是理想特性，而且是可训练的目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。提示防护是流行的轻量级防护机制，但本研究旨在揭示其局限性。

Method: 利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型可以解码的越狱提示。

Result: 该方法在Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口中持续成功越狱，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 揭示了轻量级提示防护在现代LLM架构中的固有攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出，并识别了其他关键对齐问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of

Conclusion: TSci将预测工作流程转变为白盒系统，既具有可解释性又可在不同任务间扩展，显著提升了时间序列预测的自动化水平和性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%，强化学习比监督微调更能提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法往往跳过反事实推理中的溯因步骤，导致高估LLM能力，需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤的框架。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整的溯因、干预和预测三个步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%；强化学习在代码和数学问题上表现优于监督微调，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效提升LLM的反事实推理能力并促进泛化，为改进LLM的因果理解提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了预测性偏好学习（PPL）方法，通过将人类干预信号传播到未来状态，提高交互式模仿学习的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法只修正当前状态的动作，不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作，存在安全隐患。

Method: 将每次人类干预引导到L个未来时间步（偏好视野），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，在偏好视野内应用偏好优化。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性，显著提高了学习效率并减少了人类演示需求。

Conclusion: 选择合适的偏好视野L可以在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、在推理时对齐扩散模型的方法，通过引入图像空间的KL代理正则化来防止奖励黑客问题，在保持提示遵循性的同时提升奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型生成高评分但偏离原始提示的图像。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL代理正则化，约束采样轨迹以防止奖励黑客。还提出了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间，适用于不可微分奖励。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励函数（Aesthetic、HPSv2、PickScore）和公开数据集上，MIRA相比强基线获得了超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示遵循性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随计算增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA提供了一种有效的推理时对齐方法，能够在不进行微调的情况下提升奖励分数，同时防止奖励黑客问题，适用于各种扩散模型和奖励函数。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度正则化的不同实现方式，建立了统一框架证明'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的原则性损失，揭示了'k2 as loss'在on-policy条件下与'k1 in reward'的梯度等价性，并指出'k3 as loss'是有偏的一阶近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF方法使用KL散度损失来稳定训练和防止过拟合，但不同实现方式（如GRPO）可能基于数值估计原则而忽略了其作为优化损失的功能作用，需要建立统一框架来分析这一问题。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略得分函数的分离系数（'kn in reward'）或作为直接传播梯度的损失函数（'kn as loss'），证明后者可以通过前者的等效梯度系数来分析。

Result: 证明传统'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的原则性损失；在on-policy条件下，'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价；'k3 as loss'仅是有偏的一阶近似；常见off-policy实现因忽略重要性采样而有偏。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择和正确实现KL正则化提供了基于梯度的全面理论依据，为构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IBCD方法，一种基于经验贝叶斯框架的因果发现方法，利用干预数据来推断变量间的因果图结构，能够量化不确定性并在大规模任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果发现方法在大规模任务中性能较差，且无法量化不确定性。高通量基因组扰动数据的出现为利用干预数据改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: IBCD方法对总因果效应矩阵的似然进行建模，使用矩阵正态分布近似。采用spike-and-slab horseshoe先验，从观测数据中分别学习scale-free和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量进行不确定性感知推断。

Result: 通过大量模拟实验表明，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法。在521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据上的应用显示，边后验包含概率能够识别鲁棒的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD是一个有效的因果发现框架，能够处理大规模干预数据并提供不确定性量化，在基因组扰动数据分析中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

TL;DR: TetriServe是一个针对Diffusion Transformer模型的动态并行调度系统，通过步级序列并行和轮次调度机制，在异构工作负载下提高SLO达成率和GPU利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，在混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载下效率低下，导致GPU利用率差和SLO达成率低。

Method: 提出步级序列并行策略，根据请求的截止时间动态调整并行度；引入轮次调度机制，包括时间离散化、步级并行度调整和请求联合打包。

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的SLO达成率提升，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行调度策略有效解决了DiT模型在严格SLO约束下的服务效率问题，显著提高了系统性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了强化学习（RL）能否推动蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）超越其预训练先验，揭示序列-结构-功能关系。通过在四个蛋白质设计领域进行实验，发现RL能显著提高成功率和采样效率，但性能提升取决于任务空间、奖励准确性和策略容量三个因素的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索RL是否能帮助PLMs发现监督学习未能捕捉的蛋白质序列-结构-功能规则，以及RL在蛋白质设计中的实际效用。

Method: 将RL与PLMs结合，在抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和逆折叠四个领域进行实验，使用多种RL算法和模型类别。

Result: RL在所有基准测试中都一致提高了成功率和采样效率。性能提升遵循三因素交互：任务空间、奖励保真度和策略容量共同决定收益。当奖励准确且信息丰富、策略容量充足且任务有超越监督基线的空间时，改进会扩展；当奖励嘈杂或容量受限时，尽管有探索，收益也会饱和。

Conclusion: 研究为蛋白质设计中的RL提供了实用指导：在扩展策略规模之前优先考虑奖励建模和校准，根据任务难度匹配算法和正则化强度，并在边际收益最大的地方分配容量。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布动态变化的问题。

Method: SPAMP跟踪局部梯度统计，动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换以可微分方式调制更新幅度，将裁剪和预热重新解释为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP提供了一个原则性的替代方案，取代了僵硬的启发式方法，能够更好地控制梯度更新尺度。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练RL方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的适应性问题，平衡推理不足和过度推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型通过扩展测试时计算来解决复杂推理任务，但需要根据任务难度合理分配计算资源。推理不足会导致复杂问题错误，而过度推理则会产生冗余步骤，造成令牌效率低下。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力机制识别重要步骤并修剪冗余步骤，同时估计任务难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据示例难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多个任务（AIME、AMC、GPQA-D、BBEH）上，TRAAC（Qwen3-4B）相比基础模型平均绝对准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。

Conclusion: TRAAC能够根据难度进行细粒度的思维预算调整，任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合在不同任务中都能带来收益，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

Result: 广泛的实验表明，NoRo能够成功增强UPDRS预测在不同噪声环境下的噪声鲁棒性

Conclusion: NoRo框架有效解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，提高了UPDRS评分预测的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是一种由数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变现象，这为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

*Feiyang Kang,Michael Kuchnik,Karthik Padthe,Marin Vlastelica,Ruoxi Jia,Carole-Jean Wu,Newsha Ardalani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT高分不一定能提升RL后性能，甚至可能更差。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前两阶段训练范式，质疑SFT高分是否真能转化为RL后的性能提升，发现存在反例。

Method: 训练数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO RLVR，在7个数学基准上进行了大量实验，花费超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 发现SFT分数可能偏向简单或同质数据，不能可靠预测RL增益。基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测显著提高了精度，R²和Spearman相关系数提升高达0.5。

Conclusion: SFT训练策略需要重新考虑，建议使用泛化损失和Pass@large k作为RL结果的强代理指标，这对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 大规模实证研究发现，混合1/3改写合成数据和2/3自然网络数据可加速预训练5-10倍，但单独使用合成数据效果不佳。好的合成数据比例约为30%，且8B参数生成模型已足够。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，但需要实证验证其有效性和最佳使用方式。

Method: 使用统一协议和扩展定律进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），比较自然网络数据、多种合成数据（改写文本、生成教科书）及其混合。

Result: 单独使用改写合成数据不比自然网络数据快；1/3改写合成数据+2/3自然数据可加速5-10倍；单独使用教科书式合成数据在许多下游领域表现较差；好的合成数据比例约为30%；8B参数生成模型已足够。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性益处，混合使用效果最佳，为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了曲率自适应Transformer（CAT），通过可微分门控机制动态学习每个token在三种几何注意力分支间的路由，解决了传统Transformer在非欧几里得数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer隐含假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的有效性。现有扩展到双曲和球面空间的方法需要预先固定几何，缺乏对混合几何特性的灵活性。

Method: CAT架构包含三个几何注意力分支（欧几里得、双曲、球面），通过轻量级可微分门控机制动态路由每个token到合适的曲率分支，每个分支使用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准（FB15k-237, WN18RR）上，CAT相比固定几何基线在MRR和Hits@10指标上提升约10%，仅增加5%参数且推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习的几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组合模式的水印框架，用于检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLM生成的内容可能经过后生成编辑（如人工修订或欺骗攻击），因此需要检测和定位这些修改。

Method: 使用组合模式水印框架，将词汇表划分为不相交子集，在生成过程中通过在这些子集上强制执行确定性组合模式来嵌入水印，并设计轻量级局部统计量来标记和定位潜在编辑。

Result: 在开源LLM上对各种编辑场景进行评估，展示了在编辑定位方面的强大实证性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印方法能够有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为支持基分解的新框架，用于在超越有界条目限制的情况下高效近似注意力机制，通过利用查询和键矩阵的子高斯特性，实现了亚二次运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软注意力机制的二次复杂度是扩展大型语言模型的主要瓶颈，现有亚二次注意力近似算法仅在受限的有界条目假设下有效，而该假设在实践中很少成立。

Method: 使用支持基分解框架，利用查询和键矩阵的子高斯特性，将大条目和小条目分离，对稀疏组件进行精确计算，对密集组件进行多项式近似。

Result: 建立了严格的理论保证，证明了亚二次运行时间，并扩展到多阈值设置以消除所有分布假设，为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论依据。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了有界条目的限制，为软注意力机制提供了实用的亚二次近似解决方案，并理论验证了多项式注意力与草图技术结合的有效性。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Motivation: 现有跨域持续学习方法需要完全标记的源域样本，这在隐私受限环境中不可行。本文旨在解决完全禁止使用源域样本的源无关跨域持续学习问题。

Method: 结合源预训练模型和大规模视觉语言模型，采用频率感知提示技术生成增强样本，使用不确定性加权策略处理噪声伪标签，通过KLDA冻结主干网络进行分类以防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 严格的数值研究表明，该方法显著优于那些可以访问源域样本的现有方法。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法在无需源域样本的情况下，成功解决了跨域持续学习中的域偏移、噪声伪标签和灾难性遗忘问题，取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Elsa的神经网络剪枝方法，能够实现高达90%的极端稀疏度，同时保持高模型精度，突破了传统方法50-60%稀疏度的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在大语言模型中无法超越中等稀疏度水平（50-60%）而不严重降低模型精度，这限制了模型的计算和内存效率提升。

Method: 使用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接解决当前方法依赖代理目标公式的局限性，并提出量化变体Elsa-L以扩展到超大型模型。

Result: 在广泛的模型和规模上，Elsa相比现有方法取得显著改进，如在LLaMA-2-7B模型上90%稀疏度时困惑度比最佳现有方法低7.8倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，并表明在迄今探索有限的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO通过引入轻量级mini-critics架构，在保持效率的同时恢复了critic在LLM强化学习中的作用，解决了传统价值函数在大模型场景下的计算瓶颈和稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL4LLM方法避免使用显式critic，因为传统价值函数在LLM规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失效。作者从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出AsyPPO框架，使用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个在不相交的提示分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准。利用critic间的不确定性来优化策略更新：屏蔽critic一致状态的advantages，过滤高分歧状态避免虚假探索。

Result: 仅用5000个样本训练，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比GRPO和经典PPO，在Qwen3-4b-Base上性能提升超过6%，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上提升约3%。

Conclusion: 结果表明架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO成功解决了LLM强化学习中critic角色的效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在在嵌入空间中实现均匀性和容忍度的有效平衡，以学习更强的时间序列表示。

Method: 使用层次化设置学习实例级和时间信息，整合温度调度器平衡嵌入特性，采用层次化角度间隔损失增强正负样本对的分离。

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上的分类任务中显著优于现有方法，在Yahoo和KPI异常检测数据集上获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡机制有效提升了时间序列表示学习的性能，在分类任务上表现尤为突出。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值评估KAN网络中节点重要性，解决了传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能恢复符号表示，但其架构对传统剪枝方法提出了挑战，特别是基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感，导致不可靠的节点重要性评估。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN能够保持真实的节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提高了KAN的可解释性优势，便于在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态融合方法未能充分考虑模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在识别细微情感时性能不佳，需要更智能的融合机制。

Method: 使用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，在单模态编码和跨模态交互后优先选择信息丰富的线索，减少噪声模态的影响。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线，能有效识别细微情感，且具有鲁棒性能。可视化分析显示AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差的相关性，学习更广泛的特征分布，增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: AGFN通过自适应门控融合机制有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能，特别是在处理模态质量变化和识别细微情感方面表现出色，创造了更鲁棒的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

Motivation: 在数据驱动的品类优化中，由于组合性质导致数据覆盖不足，传统方法难以设计出可证明有效的解决方案。

Method: 引入悲观式品类优化框架PASTA，利用悲观主义原则，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优品类，而不需要覆盖所有可行品类。

Result: 建立了多种常用选择模型下的首个有限样本遗憾界，包括多项式logit和嵌套logit模型，并通过数值实验证明优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在样本和模型复杂度方面达到极小极大最优，为离线品类优化提供了理论保证和实际有效性。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT)框架，通过全局优化解决神经网络表示对齐问题，克服传统方法的不对称性和深度不匹配限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示相似性方法存在三个主要问题：独立对齐各层导致结果不对称、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度的网络。这些问题源于忽略全局激活结构和限制刚性的一对一层对应。

Method: HOT联合推断软性的全局一致层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元在多个目标层之间分布质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在比对质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示了平滑、细粒度的层次对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActiNet模型（自监督ResNet-V2+HMM）在手腕加速度计数据上识别活动强度，性能优于传统随机森林+HMM方法，F1分数0.82 vs 0.77，适用于大规模流行病学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型流行病学研究中，需要从被动收集的手腕加速度计数据中准确识别人类活动强度，以研究体力活动与健康结果的关系。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（18层自监督改进ResNet-V2），结合隐马尔可夫模型平滑处理，采用5折分层组交叉验证。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏F1分数0.82，Cohen's kappa分数0.86，优于RF+HMM的0.77和0.81，在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: ActiNet模型适用于从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签，推荐用于未来流行病学研究。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能有效降低系统延迟并提升模型性能，为复杂环境下的分布式学习提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是首个无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化多为I/O感知的系统级优化，需要一种架构无关的数学保证加速方法。

Method: 利用基础分解矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需4秒离线准备即可应用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite模型上，BDA实现32%更快的键值投影、25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%（FP16）或0.0004%（FP32）。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为模型加速提供了新的数学基础。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中的模型不确定性挑战，无需生成模型访问且模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或依赖于限制性折扣因子假设，存在理论与实际应用之间的差距。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，针对总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集设计鲁棒TD算法。

Result: 建立了获得ε-精确值估计的O~(1/ε²)样本复杂度，填补了鲁棒RL算法与标准RL算法在非渐进保证方面的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法成功将鲁棒TD学习扩展到函数逼近场景，且关键思想可相对直接地扩展到鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面存在挑战，需要开发能更好理解复杂决策模式的方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络（DNN）方法对工作地点选择进行建模，并与传统离散选择模型（DCM）进行比较。

Result: DNN在工作地点选择分析中显示出作为DCM稳健替代方案的显著潜力。DNN在某些方面优于DCM，但DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合。DCM在短距离表现更佳，DNN在长距离与数据和DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 在工作地点选择分析中，应根据具体应用需求选择合适的模型，DNN和DCM各有优势。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私随机梯度下降（DPSGD）对模型公平性的影响，发现直接优化差分隐私模型的超参数虽然不能可靠地减轻DPSGD的不均衡影响，但相比重用非隐私模型的超参数，能改善效用-公平性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DPSGD训练对神经网络公平性的影响，验证直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能达到与非隐私模型相当的公平性水平。

Method: 通过比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的不均衡影响，并在广泛的超参数设置下进行分析，同时评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体的效果。

Result: 发现对某一指标的不均衡影响不一定意味着对其他指标也有类似影响；直接优化差分隐私模型超参数不能可靠减轻DPSGD的不均衡影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄露。

Conclusion: 需要仔细权衡隐私、效用和公平性之间的关系；DPSGD-Global-Adapt在超参数选择方面可能不是稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受噪声和无关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力

Method: 无监督动态特征选择(DFS)，为每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导或冗余信息，仅保留最相关特征

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，配备无监督DFS的模型在聚类和图像生成等任务中显著提高了泛化性能，计算成本仅轻微增加

Conclusion: 无监督DFS方法能有效增强潜在表示，提升模型性能且具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习研究需要多样化、具有挑战性且可扩展的环境。现代视频游戏虽然动态丰富，但计算成本高且不适合大规模实验。需要为JAX社区提供GPU加速的端到端替代方案。

Method: 基于CHIP-8模拟在JAX中实现经典街机游戏环境，提供图像化环境，涵盖解谜、动作和策略类型，可在现代GPU上大规模执行。

Result: JAX实现相比传统CPU模拟器实现数量级加速，同时保持对原始游戏机制的完美保真度。在多个游戏中训练RL代理显示训练速度和可扩展性显著提升。

Conclusion: Octax为大规模强化学习实验提供了理想的平台，其模块化设计使研究人员能够轻松扩展套件或使用大语言模型生成新环境。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

Conclusion: G²RPO框架在流模型的强化学习中实现了更精确和全面的奖励评估，提升了偏好对齐的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Result: 当前过滤器特异性有限且不一致，对真实图像具有高敏感性，但无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在关键限制，在敏感应用中部署前需要过滤器设计的重大改进，否则可能暴露不可接受的患者信息水平。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索跳跃连接在扩展维度上的潜力，同时通过狭窄瓶颈保持计算效率。

Method: 提出Hourglass MLP块，采用宽-窄-宽结构，跳跃连接在扩展维度操作，残差计算通过狭窄瓶颈。初始投影可保持随机初始化不变，实现高效训练和推理。

Result: Hourglass架构在生成任务中始终优于传统设计，随着参数预算增加，最优配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的放置方式，这一发现可扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Query Attention (SQA)机制，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度问题，现有解决方案如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力得分计算所需的FLOPs，这仍然是训练和全序列处理的关键瓶颈。

Method: 引入稀疏查询注意力(SQA)架构，通过减少查询头数量而非键/值头来直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，减少的因子与查询头减少比例成正比。

Result: 在长序列(32k-200k token)基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景下(如预训练、微调和编码器任务)可实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，初步小规模实验显示对模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA作为一种补充优化路径，通过减少查询头直接降低计算复杂度，是构建更高效可扩展模型的强大工具，该发现在开发Reactive Transformer架构时偶然获得。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

Conclusion: APS方法成功克服了离散扩散后验采样的关键限制，为预训练扩散模型的后验采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为概念神经元选择（CNS）的新方法，用于在持续学习场景中更新扩散模型，通过识别与目标概念相关的神经元并进行增量微调，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: CNS方法独特地识别扩散模型中与目标概念密切相关的神经元，以增量方式微调这些概念神经元，并联合保留先前学到的知识。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估表明，CNS在单概念和多概念个性化任务中都达到了最先进的性能，仅需最少的参数调整。同时实现了无融合操作，减少了持续个性化所需的内存存储和处理时间。

Conclusion: CNS是一种简单而有效的持续学习方法，能够有效解决扩散模型增量更新中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持模型的零样本生成能力。

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

TL;DR: CNML是一种新颖的对比学习方法，将模型检查任务作为指导信号来学习逻辑规范和系统的对齐表示，在形式验证领域表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在验证安全关键系统方面显示出潜力，但表示学习在形式验证领域仍未充分探索，需要开发能够有效处理逻辑规范和系统的表示学习方法。

Method: 通过自监督对比学习目标，将逻辑规范和系统共同嵌入到共享的潜在空间中，利用模型检查任务作为指导信号。

Result: 在行业启发的检索任务中，CNML在跨模态和模态内设置下显著优于算法和神经基线方法，学习到的表示能有效迁移到下游任务并泛化到更复杂的公式。

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标，CNML证明了这一方法的有效性，为形式验证领域的表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

TL;DR: 提出Equilibrium Matching (EqM)生成模型框架，通过平衡动力学视角学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，采用基于优化的采样过程，在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散和基于流的生成模型使用非平衡、时间条件动态，EqM旨在通过平衡动态视角构建更高效的生成框架。

Method: 学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，在推理时采用基于优化的采样过程，使用可调步长、自适应优化器和自适应计算进行梯度下降。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID，超越传统扩散/流模型，并能处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM通过统一平衡景观替代时间条件速度，在流模型和能量基模型间建立更紧密桥梁，提供优化驱动推理的简单路径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Motivation: 对称性在等变网络设计和控制方程发现中广泛应用，但在复杂场景中通常未知。现有方法大多局限于线性对称性，非线性对称性发现方法无法显式获得李代数子空间。

Method: 指定无穷小群作用的函数库，求解其系数矩阵。通过将数据的中心差分和训练神经网络的雅可比矩阵代入无穷小准则，得到系数矩阵的线性方程组，使用SVD求解。

Result: 在顶夸克标记和一系列动态系统上，LieNLSD显示出优于现有方法的定性优势，将神经PDE求解器的长程滚动精度提高超过20%，并成功指导数据增强。

Conclusion: LieNLSD是首个能够确定非线性项无穷小生成器数量及其显式表达式的方法，在对称性发现方面具有重要突破，为复杂系统的建模和求解提供了新工具。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Result: 在规则学习和运动学习任务中成功恢复了真实组件和统计信息，能够从单个示例快速推断新解决方案

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表现力和概率推理的数据效率，实现了快速组合式元学习

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

TL;DR: 本文分析了梯度空间的动态特性，发现虽然小部分子空间捕获了大部分梯度能量，但仍有显著部分存在于残差空间中，且核心子空间的影响随时间推移和网络深度增加而减弱。基于这些发现，作者提出了GrassWalk和GrassJump两种随机算法，在LLaMA-1B和LLaMA-7B预训练中实现了最先进的内存节省并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练常受限于极端内存需求，其中优化器状态占主导地位。现有工作通过将梯度投影到低维子空间来缓解这一成本，但需要更深入地理解梯度空间动态特性。

Method: 分析梯度空间及其子空间的动态特性，发现梯度空间具有近平坦曲率特性。基于这些洞察，提出了GrassWalk和GrassJump两种随机算法，利用子空间特性进行优化。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B和LLaMA-7B预训练中，提出的算法实现了最先进的内存节省，同时提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 梯度空间分析揭示了子空间动态特性的重要规律，基于这些规律设计的算法能够有效平衡内存效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然动态过程只能通过静态样本快照观察，重建其时间演化以揭示底层动态特性对科学研究至关重要。现有方法在可扩展性和假设限制方面存在不足。

Method: 扩展Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching，推导出多边际情况下的迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，采用新颖的因子化方式处理多个边际分布。

Result: 在玩具示例上保留理论特性，在真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，首次在非常高维图像设置中恢复耦合和动态。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥是恢复静态数据中隐藏动态的实用且原则性方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

Motivation: 传统诊断模型孤立分析不同医疗数据源，无法捕捉跨模态相关性，限制了早期疾病诊断能力。

Conclusion: 该框架朝着精准诊断的统一基础模型发展，可提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

TL;DR: 本文探索了Tsetlin Machine在大型多通道图像分类中的应用，提出了一种生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法，在保持可解释性的同时，在MNIST和CelebA数据集上取得了与深度学习模型相竞争的性能。


<details>

Motivation: Tsetlin Machine是一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的新型机器学习范式，比神经网络更具可解释性。本文旨在探索TM架构在大规模多通道图像分类中的适用性，同时保持其可解释性优势。

Method: 提出了一种生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将这类模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RoGRAD框架，首次通过检索增强生成和迭代图对比学习来动态优化图神经网络，解决了传统GNN和LLM增强方法在复合图缺陷下的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响GNN性能。现有研究缺乏对传统方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强方法并非总是优于传统方法。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架，采用检索增强生成(RAG)注入类别一致且多样化的增强数据，通过迭代图对比学习强制区分性表示，将静态信号注入转变为动态优化过程。

Result: RoGRAD在广泛实验中表现出色，优于传统GNN和LLM增强基线方法，平均提升达82.43%。

Conclusion: RoGRAD是首个迭代范式，通过动态优化显著提升了图神经网络在复合缺陷下的鲁棒性，挑战了LLM增强方法总是更优的假设。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法在性能上仍落后于全参数微调，部分原因是未能充分利用低秩流形的几何结构。

Method: 采用三因子分解U-S-V⊤，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，使用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效学习子空间，同时保持与现有微调管道的兼容性，显著提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Conclusion: 本文为超越0-1损失设置的对抗鲁棒分类器设计提供了有效的计算框架，揭示了对抗鲁棒性与优化理论中经典问题的深层联系，为更广泛的损失函数下的鲁棒学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将传统的后处理模型校准技术（如直方图分箱和温度缩放）引入联邦学习环境，针对客户端异构性设计了新方法，并在联邦学习和差分隐私设置下评估了校准性能。

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Conclusion: 几何感知的探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式，能够有效发现高活性抗菌肽。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GraphNC框架，通过异常分数分布对齐和基于扰动的正态性正则化来校准图异常检测中的正态性，提高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误检率。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA)通过对齐教师模型的分数分布来优化异常分数；基于扰动的正态性正则化(NormReg)通过在表示空间最小化扰动引导的一致性损失来使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: 分数对齐使正常和异常类的异常分数向两端分离，产生更可分的异常分数；正则化缓解了教师模型不准确分数的误导。

Conclusion: GraphNC通过联合利用标注和未标注数据，在异常分数和节点表示空间校准正态性，有效提升了图异常检测性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应混合流变分推理(AMF-VI)，通过两阶段训练异质流混合模型，在多种后验分布上实现更稳健的变分推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一流模型在不同类型的分布上表现不一致，需要一种能够适应各种后验分布形状的稳健变分推理方法。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 顺序专家训练(MAF、RealNVP、RBIG等流模型)；2) 基于似然的全局权重自适应估计，无需逐样本门控或架构修改。

Result: 在六种典型后验分布上，AMF-VI相比单一流基线实现了更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2距离和最大均值差异指标上获得稳定提升。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流模型为跨不同后验分布族的稳健变分推理提供了可靠途径，同时保留了每个专家的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Conclusion: PPGen和HAI为PPG模型提供了一条路径，既保持了深度学习特征所需的保真度，又支持临床解释和明智的硬件设计。

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Conclusion: 通过最大似然估计微调Flow Matching是有效的，能够弥补训练-推理差距，提高模型在生成任务中的表现

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务中，PENEX表现出比现有方法更好的正则化效果，计算成本相似。

Conclusion: PENEX作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，在深度神经网络训练和微调中具有潜力。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态迭代特性，而金融领域对经济价值和决策有直接影响，需要专门的交易评估基准。

Method: 构建无污染的基准测试环境，让智能体接收每日市场价格、基本面和新闻信号，做出买卖或持有的顺序决策，使用累计回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估显示大多数LLM智能体难以超越简单的买入持有基准，但部分模型展现出获得更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力，表明静态金融知识能力不一定能转化为成功的交易策略。

Conclusion: StockBench作为开源资源发布，支持可复现性并推动该领域未来研究，突显了开发LLM金融智能体的挑战与机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

### [337] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端框架，通过神经网络排序器、分位数分层校准和集成阈值估计，在数千万几何对中实现精确召回控制，显著降低方差和冗余验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度手动审查会增加成本。传统置信区间方法通常超出目标几个百分点，且在偏斜分数分布下运行间方差较高。

Method: 使用等网格边界框过滤和CSR候选表示减少对枚举；确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经网络排序器；通过单次前向传播将分数传播到所有剩余对，构建可重现的分数分位数分层校准集；集成四种阈值估计方法（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson和精确分位数），通过逆方差加权融合九个独立子样本。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法始终在较小误差内达到召回目标，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了精确的召回控制，具有亚百分位方差，显著优于传统方法，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExGRPO框架通过识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用，显著提升RLVR的推理性能和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定。虽然先前研究强调了重用过去经验的好处，但经验特性在大型推理模型学习动态中的作用仍未充分探索。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架：识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上的实验显示，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上持续提升推理性能，相比在线策略RLVR平均增益+3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上都能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 原则性的经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO通过经验价值识别和优化显著提升了推理性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DECOR是一种用于线性高斯结构方程模型的联合学习方法，在存在潜在混杂的情况下同时学习DAG和相关噪声模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而去混杂流程依赖于普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够处理潜在混杂的统一方法。

Method: 提出DECOR方法，通过交替执行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新来联合学习DAG和相关噪声模型，可包含bow互补性惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别在混杂非普遍时表现稳健，在普遍混杂情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR提供了一个统一的似然框架，能够在存在潜在混杂的情况下有效学习因果结构，具有理论可识别性保证。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Result: 在氢析出反应概念验证中成功识别出铂是最有效的已知催化剂

Conclusion: 该生成建模框架为加速发现新型高效催化剂提供了有前景的途径，未来将扩展到氧析出反应和更广泛的材料搜索空间

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

*Jianing Qi,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG)，将扩散模型中的classifier-free guidance扩展到经典策略梯度方法，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现无需重新训练的行为调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导机制扩展到标准在线强化学习方法，实现可控的行为调节。

Method: 在策略梯度中增加无条件分支，插值条件分支和无条件分支，通过优势估计消除归一化项，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件dropout在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数能提升稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导机制可以从扩散策略扩展到标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DialTree-RPO框架，通过强化学习和树搜索自动发现多轮对话攻击策略，相比现有方法在10个目标模型上攻击成功率提升25.9%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下仍易受对抗攻击，现有方法主要依赖人工红队测试或预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间，而研究表明LLMs对多轮攻击的脆弱性显著高于单轮攻击

Method: 将对话建模为序列决策问题，结合on-policy强化学习和树搜索，无需人工标注数据即可系统性地探索多轮攻击策略

Result: 在10个目标模型上相比现有最优方法攻击成功率提升25.9%以上，并能有效发现新的攻击策略

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO框架能够自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，显著提升攻击成功率，揭示了多轮对话中复杂动态和战略规划对LLM安全性的重要影响

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

### [343] [Reinforcement Learning with Action-Triggered Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02149)
*Alexander Ryabchenko,Wenlong Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了动作触发稀疏可追踪马尔可夫决策过程（ATST-MDPs）框架，针对状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题，开发了动作序列学习范式和相关算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界应用中，状态观测是由动作随机触发的，这种约束在传统强化学习框架中未被充分研究。

Method: 推导了针对ATST-MDPs的贝尔曼最优方程，引入动作序列学习范式，提出ST-LSVI-UCB算法，利用线性MDP假设下的特征映射结构。

Result: ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界，其中K是回合数，d是特征维度，γ是折扣因子。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在稀疏、动作触发的观测条件下学习建立了理论基础，证明了在此类观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练采用固定的优化方案，缺乏对训练不稳定性和突发问题的动态响应能力。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为中介，允许用户或AI代理在训练过程中实时调整优化器超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究证明，该框架实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求变化的适应性。

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了Flatness-Aware SGLD (fSGLD)方法，通过随机权重扰动来寻找平坦最小值，在保持SGD计算成本的同时实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关。

Method: 在每次迭代中使用随机权重扰动(RWP)计算随机梯度，优化随机平滑目标函数，隐式捕获曲率信息。

Result: 理论证明fSGLD的稳态分布接近Hessian迹正则化损失函数的全局最小化器，实验显示在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中取得优越的泛化和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: fSGLD能有效寻找平坦最小值，在保持计算效率的同时提升泛化性能，为随机权重扰动的益处提供了理论解释。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

Conclusion: GRACE能够构建复杂多任务设置中的奖励API，生成的代码奖励函数可检查验证，解决了逆强化学习的可解释性问题。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

TL;DR: Poolformer是一种序列到序列模型，用循环层替代自注意力机制，并引入池化操作来减少序列长度，在长序列处理上优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在长序列处理上存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其实际应用。需要开发更高效的序列建模方法。

Method: 使用递归定义的SkipBlocks结构，包含残差块、下池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上池化层和额外残差块，用循环层替代自注意力。

Result: 池化显著加速训练、改善感知指标（FID和IS）并防止过拟合。在原始音频处理上优于SaShiMi和Mamba等最先进模型。

Conclusion: Poolformer为长序列处理提供了有效解决方案，未来可扩展到文本、视觉和多模态场景。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练掩码扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)，使其推理既更好(愤怒)又更快。通过离策略RL训练代理策略，结合两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正，提高样本效率和任务性能。同时联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值，在减少函数评估次数的同时获得更好精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练扩散大语言模型时存在效率问题，需要开发一个统一框架来同时提升推理质量和速度。通过强化学习来优化模型的推理过程，既提高准确性又减少计算成本。

Method: 1. 使用离策略RL训练代理策略，提出两阶段似然近似结合重要性采样校正的通用RL算法；2. 联合训练dLLMs策略的高效采样器/控制器，让模型学习自适应分配每个提示的推理阈值；3. 利用dLLMs的多令牌预测能力，优化推理时间计算。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型，展示了方法的有效性。相比仅训练模型，联合训练采样器能以更少的函数评估次数获得更好的准确性，在dLLMs推理时间计算的帕累托前沿上取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过强化学习成功优化了扩散大语言模型的推理过程，实现了在提高任务性能的同时显著减少计算成本，为高效dLLMs训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and

TL;DR: 提出C2AL方法，通过分析数据集子结构和利用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，解决推荐模型中因数据异质性导致的注意力机制失效问题，在超大规模生产数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界推荐数据由异质用户群体组成，但单一全局目标的训练假设数据同质性。随着模型规模和复杂度增加，模型会偏向主导分布模式，忽视头部和尾部区域，导致注意力权重失效或神经元死亡。

Method: 分析数据集子结构，通过具有强分布对比的子结构进行辅助学习。利用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程以保持与少数群体的互信息。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上对6个SOTA模型进行评估，因子分解机能够捕捉细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低0.16%，目标少数群体收益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: 注意力机制在因子分解机中扮演共享嵌入选择的关键角色，通过辅助学习暴露分布对比强的子结构，能够有效解决数据异质性带来的模型偏差问题。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测每个时间步的独立边际分布，而非完整的联合预测分布。生成具有现实相关结构的预测样本路径通常需要昂贵的自回归采样。

Method: 采用copula方法，在单次前向传递中从多步时间序列基础模型生成相关样本路径。

Result: copula方法比自回归采样快几个数量级，并通过减轻误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: copula方法为从多步时间序列基础模型生成相关样本路径提供了一种高效准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer和xLSTM的扩展规律，发现在典型的大语言模型训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更好的扩展性，且随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加，xLSTM的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer一直是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在保持十亿参数级别竞争力的同时，具有相对于上下文长度的线性复杂度。研究旨在比较两种架构的扩展行为，为未来模型设计和部署提供指导。

Method: 1. 在广泛模型规模(80M-7B)和训练token数量(2B-2T)范围内，使用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法研究xLSTM在计算最优和过度训练机制中的扩展行为；2. 研究最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；3. 分析推理时的扩展特性。

Result: 研究发现，在典型的大语言模型训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更好的扩展性。更重要的是，随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加，xLSTM的优势会进一步扩大。

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展性方面优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景中表现更佳，这为未来大语言模型的架构选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，这种灵活性带来了分布式切片移动性攻击的潜在漏洞，这是一种分布式拒绝服务攻击形式。

Method: 采用正未标记学习，结合长短期记忆自编码器和K-Means聚类，利用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为机器学习模型特征。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试床上，当训练数据集包含10%到40%攻击污染时，F1分数超过98.50%，优于其他基于正未标记学习的解决方案。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能够有效检测分布式切片移动性攻击变种，并在存在污染训练数据的情况下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统深度学习优化中每步更新所有层的假设，认为全网络更新在理论和实践上都是次优的，寻求更高效的训练方法。

Method: 引入非欧几里得随机渐进训练方法Drop-Muon，每步仅根据随机调度更新部分层，结合渐进式训练效率和层特定非欧几里得更新。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络Muon，达到相同精度时wall-clock时间快1.4倍，提供了严格的收敛保证。

Conclusion: 全网络更新只有在特定层平滑度关系下才是最优的，Drop-Muon为大规模模型训练提供了理论依据充分的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

Motivation: GNN在分子机器学习中占主导地位，但其基于预定义图结构的设计限制了表达能力（固定感受野）并降低了推理速度。本文旨在探索Transformer能否在没有硬编码图偏置的情况下学习分子建模。

Result: Transformer在匹配计算预算下达到与最先进等变GNN竞争的能量和力平均绝对误差，学习到物理一致的模式（如注意力权重随原子间距离反比衰减），并能灵活适应不同分子环境。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的许多有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Motivation: 解决反应式干扰问题，干扰者采用动态策略选择信道和检测阈值来干扰传输，需要学习避免干扰并优化吞吐量。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL），Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，深度Q网络（DQN）处理基于接收功率的连续状态，通过不同奖励函数和动作集进行学习。

Result: RL能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时仍能维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态反应式干扰的有效方法，能够在不了解信道条件或干扰策略先验知识的情况下实现自适应抗干扰。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在RF信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为无线诊断、部署和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过从教师模型的压缩KV缓存中蒸馏知识到潜在推理学生模型，解决了潜在推理缺乏监督的问题，结合了CoT的准确性和潜在推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维推理计算成本高且存在冗余，而潜在推理缺乏有效监督，限制了其在复杂自然语言推理中的效果。

Method: 提出KaVa框架，通过自蒸馏将教师模型压缩KV缓存中的知识蒸馏到潜在推理学生模型中，利用连续潜在令牌的表征灵活性对齐逐步KV轨迹。

Result: 该方法持续优于强潜在基线，在从方程到自然语言轨迹的退化显著减小，可扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了CoT训练教师的准确性和潜在推理的效率与可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的AMG参数自动调优方法，通过将稀疏矩阵视为灰度图像，使用池化提取特征，自动优化强阈值参数和平滑器选择，显著提升AMG求解器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMG方法的效率严重依赖于参数选择，特别是强阈值参数和平滑器。对于多面体离散化产生的线性系统，由于网格变异性大，这种依赖性更加关键。

Method: 将多面体离散化产生的稀疏矩阵视为灰度图像，应用池化操作提取紧凑特征，构建神经网络自动调优AMG的强阈值参数和平滑器选择。

Result: 在2D和3D异构系数和多边形/多面体网格的多种微分问题测试中，该方法泛化性能良好，可将AMG求解器时间减少高达27%。

Conclusion: 所提出的深度学习方法能有效自动调优AMG参数，显著提升求解效率，且对现有PolyDG和VEM代码改动极小。

Abstract: Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods are state-of-the-art algebraic solvers for
partial differential equations. Still, their efficiency depends heavily on the
choice of suitable parameters and/or ingredients. Paradigmatic examples include
the so-called strong threshold parameter $\theta$, which controls the algebraic
coarse-grid hierarchy, as well as the smoother, i.e., the relaxation methods
used on the fine grid to damp out high-frequency errors. In AMG, since the
coarse grids are constructed algebraically (without geometric intuition), the
smoother's performance is even more critical. For the linear systems stemming
from polytopal discretizations, such as Polytopal Discontinuous Galerkin
(PolyDG) and Virtual Element Methods (VEM), AMG sensitivity to such choices is
even more critical due to the significant variability of the underlying meshes,
which results in algebraic systems with different sparsity patterns. We propose
a novel deep learning approach that automatically tunes the strong threshold
parameter, as well as the smoother choice in AMG solvers, for linear systems of
equations arising from polytopal discretizations, thereby maximizing AMG
performance. We interpret the sparse matrix resulting from polytopal
discretization as a grayscale image, and by applying pooling, our neural
network extracts compact features that preserve the necessary information at a
low computational cost. We test various differential problems in both two- and
three-dimensional settings, with heterogeneous coefficients and
polygonal/polyhedral meshes, and demonstrate that the proposed approach
generalizes well. In practice, we demonstrate that we can reduce AMG solver
time by up to $27\%$ with minimal changes to existing PolyDG and VEM codes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE逆问题中数据选择的核心挑战在于其无限维特性：参数空间和设计空间都是无限的，这使得选择过程变得复杂。需要找到有效的方法来从无限维数据中选择最具信息量的子集。

Method: 采用随机数值线性代数方法，通过概率性保证来保留信息。这些方法使用N个随机选择的加权样本，以至少1-p的概率确保信息被保留。

Result: 随机数值线性代数方法为PDE逆问题中的数据选择提供了有效的数学工具，能够处理无限维空间的复杂性，并通过概率保证确保信息完整性。

Conclusion: 随机数值线性代数方法为PDE逆问题中的数据选择问题提供了强大的解决方案，特别适用于处理无限维参数和设计空间的挑战，为这一领域带来了新的研究视角。

Abstract: All inverse problems rely on data to recover unknown parameters, yet not all
data are equally informative. This raises the central question of data
selection. A distinctive challenge in PDE-based inverse problems is their
inherently infinite-dimensional nature: both the parameter space and the design
space are infinite, which greatly complicates the selection process. Somewhat
unexpectedly, randomized numerical linear algebra (RNLA), originally developed
in very different contexts, has provided powerful tools for addressing this
challenge. These methods are inherently probabilistic, with guarantees
typically stating that information is preserved with probability at least 1-p
when using N randomly selected, weighted samples. Here, the notion of
information can take different mathematical forms depending on the setting. In
this review, we survey the problem of data selection in PDE-based inverse
problems, emphasize its unique infinite-dimensional aspects, and highlight how
RNLA strategies have been adapted and applied in this context.

*Behnam Hashemi,Yuji Nakatsukasa*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 分析了Sherman-Morrison公式的数值稳定性，发现其存在不稳定性，并通过引入固定精度迭代精化方法实现了向后稳定性，同时保持了原公式的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sherman-Morrison公式虽然简单高效且广泛应用，但其数值稳定性一直是一个开放性问题，特别是在科学计算中越来越常见的场景下。

Method: 首先分析SM公式的向后稳定性，然后在其框架中引入固定精度迭代精化方法，重用先前计算的分解结果。

Result: 理论上证明了在合理假设下，带迭代精化的SM公式能够实现向后稳定性而不牺牲效率。实验观察到该方法在所有数值实验中最终都能产生向后稳定的解。

Conclusion: 当A和A+uv^T的条件数都安全地远离单位舍入误差的倒数时，带迭代精化的SM公式能够产生向后稳定的解。

Abstract: Owing to its simplicity and efficiency, the Sherman-Morrison (SM) formula has
seen widespread use across various scientific and engineering applications for
solving rank-one perturbed linear systems of the form $(A+uv^T)x = b$. Although
the formula dates back at least to 1944, its numerical stability properties
have remained an open question and continue to be a topic of current research.
We analyze the backward stability of the SM, demonstrate its instability in a
scenario increasingly common in scientific computing and address an open
question posed by Nick Higham on the proportionality of the backward error
bound to the condition number of $A$. We then incorporate fixed-precision
iterative refinement into the SM framework reusing the previously computed
decompositions and prove that, under reasonable assumptions, it achieves
backward stability without sacrificing the efficiency of the SM formula. While
our theory does not prove the SM formula with iterative refinement always
outputs a backward stable solution, empirically it is observed to eventually
produce a backward stable solution in all our numerical experiments. We
conjecture that with iterative refinement, the SM formula yields a backward
stable solution provided that $\kappa_2(A), \kappa_2(A+uv^T)$ are both bounded
safely away from $\epsilon_M^{-1}$, where $\epsilon_M$ is the unit roundoff.

Conclusion: B样条方法在点云演化中具有优势，特别是在处理点密度变化和几何特征近似方面表现良好。

Abstract: This paper explores an efficient Lagrangian approach for evolving point cloud
data on smooth manifolds. In this preliminary study, we focus on analyzing
plane curves, and our ultimate goal is to provide an alternative to the
conventional radial basis function (RBF) approach for manifolds in higher
dimensions. In particular, we use the B-Spline as the basis function for all
local interpolations. Just like RBF and other smooth basis functions, B-Splines
enable the approximation of geometric features such as normal vectors and
curvature. Once properly set up, the advantage of using B-Splines is that their
coefficients carry geometric meanings. This allows the coefficients to be
manipulated like points, facilitates rapid updates of the interpolant, and
eliminates the need for frequent re-interpolation. Consequently, the removal
and insertion of point cloud data become seamless processes, particularly
advantageous in regions experiencing significant fluctuations in point density.
The numerical results demonstrate the convergence of geometric quantities and
the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we show simulations of curvature
flows whose speeds depend on the solutions of coupled reaction--diffusion
systems for pattern formation.

Method: 第一种方法结合了Toro等人的中心FORCE方法和Béreux与Sainsaulieu的非分裂策略；第二种方法采用近似黎曼求解器，仔细处理源项近似。

Result: 构建的两种格式都具有渐近保持特性，其极限格式在松弛参数趋于零时与平衡模型一致，且无CFL限制。对于特定模型，可证明它们保持不变域并满足离散熵不等式。

Conclusion: 成功开发了两种整体处理松弛系统的数值格式，这些格式具有渐近保持特性，在松弛极限下保持一致性，且无稳定性限制。

Abstract: This paper presents the construction of two numerical schemes for the
solution of hyperbolic systems with relaxation source terms. The methods are
built by considering the relaxation system as a whole, without separating the
resolution of the convective part from that of the source term. The first
scheme combines the centered FORCE approach of Toro and co-authors with the
unsplit strategy proposed by B{\'e}reux and Sainsaulieu. The second scheme
consists of an approximate Riemann solver which carefully handles the source
term approximation. The two schemes are built to be asymptotic preserving, in
the sense that their limit schemes are consistent with the equilibrium model as
the relaxation parameter tends to zero, without any CFL restriction. For
specific models, it is possible to prove that they preserve invariant domains
and admit a discrete entropy inequality.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在一般多面体网格上保持数值解有界性的方法，结合多面体网格的几何灵活性和间断Galerkin方法的精度与稳定性。

Method: 基于间断Galerkin方法，在多面体网格内构建单纯形子网格，通过非线性迭代在子网格节点处强制实施边界约束。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将多面体网格的几何灵活性与间断Galerkin离散化的精度和稳定性相结合，同时严格保证边界保持特性。

Abstract: We introduce a nodally bound-preserving Galerkin method for second-order
elliptic problems on general polygonal/polyhedral, henceforth collectively
termed as \emph{polytopic}, meshes. Starting from an interior penalty
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation posed on a polytopic mesh, the method
enforces preservation of \emph{a priori} prescribed upper and lower bounds for
the numerical solution at an arbitrary number of user-defined points
\emph{within} each polytopic element. This is achieved by employing a
simplicial submesh and enforcing bound preservation at the submesh nodes via a
nonlinear iteration. By construction, the submeshing procedure preserves the
order of accuracy of the DG method, \emph{without} introducing any additional
global numerical degrees of freedom compared to the baseline DG method,
thereby, falling into the category of composite finite element approaches. A
salient feature of the proposed method is that it automatically reverts to the
standard DG method on polytopic meshes when no prescribed bound violation
occurs. In particular, the choice of the discontinuity-penalisation parameter
is independent of the submesh granularity. The resulting composite method
combines the geometric flexibility of polytopic meshes with the accuracy and
stability of discontinuous Galerkin discretisations, while rigorously
guaranteeing bound preservation. The existence and uniqueness of the numerical
solution is proven. A priori error bounds, assuming sufficient regularity of
the exact solution are shown, employing a non-standard construction of discrete
nodally bound-preserving interpolant. Numerical experiments confirm optimal
convergence for smooth problems and demonstrate robustness in the presence of
sharp gradients, such as boundary and interior layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决标准Owen加扰在维度较高时增益系数呈指数增长的问题，开发一种在保持良好方差衰减率的同时对维度更鲁棒的随机化方法。

Method: 基于混合基数表示，通过置换数字块来构建粗加扰方法，该方法专门设计用于保持(0,e,d)序列特性。

Result: 对于足够光滑的被积函数，该方法实现了标准的O(n^{-3+ε})方差衰减率，且最大增益系数仅以O(log d)对数增长，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 粗加扰在维度增长时比Owen加扰更具鲁棒性，特别适用于具有低有效截断维度的函数，而Owen加扰在对低维投影敏感的函数上表现更优。

Abstract: We introduce \emph{coarse scrambling}, a novel randomization for digital
sequences that permutes blocks of digits in a mixed-radix representation. This
construction is designed to preserve the powerful
$(0,\boldsymbol{e},d)$-sequence property of the underlying points. For
sufficiently smooth integrands, we prove that this method achieves the
canonical $O(n^{-3+\epsilon})$ variance decay rate, matching that of standard
Owen's scrambling. Crucially, we show that its maximal gain coefficient grows
only logarithmically with dimension, $O(\log d)$, thus providing theoretical
robustness against the curse of dimensionality affecting scrambled Sobol'
sequences. Numerical experiments validate these findings and illustrate a
practical trade-off: while Owen's scrambling is superior for integrands
sensitive to low-dimensional projections, coarse scrambling is competitive for
functions with low effective truncation dimension.

Result: 推导出了在不同精度设置下可达到范数残差的充分条件，证明了对于条件数高达1/u_s的Lyapunov方程，可以使用半精度等降低精度来加速求解而不损害解的质量。

Conclusion: 混合精度迭代精化框架能够有效利用降低的计算精度加速Lyapunov矩阵方程的求解，同时通过严格的误差分析保证了解的数值质量。

Abstract: We develop a mixed-precision iterative refinement framework for solving
low-rank Lyapunov matrix equations $AX + XA^T + W =0$, where $W=LL^T$ or
$W=LSL^T$. Via rounding error analysis of the algorithms we derive sufficient
conditions for the attainable normwise residuals in different precision
settings and show how the algorithmic parameters should be chosen. Using the
sign function Newton iteration as the solver, we show that reduced precisions,
such as the half precision, can be used as the solver precision (with unit
roundoff $u_s$) to accelerate the solution of Lyapunov equations of condition
number up to $1/u_s$ without compromising its quality.

Conclusion: 该方法可作为其他迭代数值方法的预求解器，也可作为某些GMRES求解器的内部迭代步骤。

Abstract: We present an enhanced version of the row-based randomized block-Kaczmarz
method to solve a linear system of equations. This improvement makes use of a
regularization during block updates in the solution, and a dynamic proposal
distribution based on the current residue and effective orthogonality between
blocks. This improved method provides significant gains in solving
high-condition number linear systems that are either sparse, or dense
least-squares problems that are significantly over/under determined.
Considering the poor generalizability of preconditioners for such problems, it
can also serve as a pre-solver for other iterative numerical methods when
required, and as an inner iteration in certain types of GMRES solvers for
linear systems.

Abstract: The classical problem of steady streaming induced by an oscillating object
has been studied extensively, but prior work has focused almost exclusively on
single-frequency oscillations, which result in symmetric, quadrupole-like
flows. Here we demonstrate that dual-frequency oscillations induce asymmetric
steady streaming with a non-zero net flux in a direction determined by the
polarity of the oscillation \ -- the oscillator serves as a pump. We use
numerical simulations and asymptotic analysis at low Reynolds number to examine
2D steady streaming around a cylinder, first focusing on frequency ratio two.
The computational experiments show asymmetrical streaming and pumping, i.e.,
net flux downstream. It is well known from asymptotic analysis that steady
streaming is second order in amplitude, and we show pumping occurs at third
order. We then extend the analysis to general frequency ratios, where we give
necessary conditions for pumping and predict the order in amplitude at which
pumping occurs. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with
computational simulations for different frequency ratios, and we discuss the
implications for using dual-mode vibrations to pump fluids in lab-on-a-chip and
other applications.

Abstract: Fluid deformation controls myriad processes including mixing and dispersion,
development of stress in complex fluids, droplet breakup and emulsification,
fluid-structure interaction, chemical reactions and biological activity. We
develop a simple stochastic model for fluid deformation in random unsteady
flows such as homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We show that although the
Lagrangian velocity process is non-Markovian and non-Fickian, temporal
decorrelation due to the unsteady nature of the flow renders the evolution of
the Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor to be Fickian. Application of a
coordinate transform renders the velocity gradient tensor upper triangular,
eliminating vortical rotation and decoupling principal stretches from shear
deformations, leading to a stochastic model of fluid deformation as a simple
Brownian process. We develop closed-form expressions for the evolution of the
Cauchy-Green tensor and show that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are
Gaussian distribution. Application of this model to DNS calculations of forced
isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds number Re$_\lambda\approx 433$,
confirms the underlying model assumptions and provides excellent agreement with
theoretical results.

Abstract: A droplet impacting a deep fluid bath is as common as rain over the ocean. If
the impact is sufficiently gentle, the mediating air layer remains intact, and
the droplet may rebound completely from the interface. In this work, we
experimentally investigate the role of translational bath motion on the
bouncing to coalescence transition. Over a range of parameters, we find that
the relative bath motion systematically decreases the normal Weber number
required to transition from bouncing to merging. Direct numerical simulations
demonstrate that the depression created during impact combined with the
translational motion of the bath enhances the air layer drainage on the
upstream side of the droplet, ultimately favoring coalescence. A simple
geometric argument is presented that rationalizes the collapse of the
experimental threshold data, extending what is known for the case of
axisymmetric normal impacts to the more general 3D scenario of interest herein.
