### [1] [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549)
*Wendong Mao,Mingfan Zhao,Jianfeng Guan,Qiwei Dong,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件友好的优化框架，用于解决可变形注意力变换器（DAT）在硬件部署中的内存访问效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT的数据依赖采样机制导致不规则内存访问模式，现有加速方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 1. 提出基于神经架构搜索（NAS）的切片策略，自动划分输入特征为均匀块；2. 设计FPGA验证系统。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上仅损失0.2%精度；FPGA实验显示DRAM访问次数减少至18%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持精度的同时显著提升了硬件效率。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

### [2] [Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550)
*Hyeonseok Jin,Geonmin Kim,Kyungbaek Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DDCN的新方法，用于高效且准确的时空交通预测，解决了传统GNN和CNN的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在捕捉时空异质性和扩展性方面的不足，特别是GNN需要预定义邻接矩阵且难以扩展的问题。

Method: 采用动态可变形卷积网络（DDCN），通过编码器-解码器结构和空间-时空注意力块动态调整滤波器。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上验证了DDCN的竞争性能，展示了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN是一种高效且准确的时空交通预测方法，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

### [3] [Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554)
*Zejian Li,Yize Li,Chenye Meng,Zhongni Liu,Yang Ling,Shengyuan Zhang,Guang Yang,Changyuan Yang,Zhiyuan Yang,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Inversion-DPO的新对齐框架，通过DDIM反演优化扩散模型，避免了奖励建模的计算开销，提高了训练效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型对齐方法需要计算密集型训练，可能导致模型精度和效率下降。

Method: 利用DDIM反演重新定义直接偏好优化（DPO），通过确定性反演从样本到噪声进行后验采样。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中，Inversion-DPO显著优于现有方法，生成高保真且组合一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型提供了一种高效、高精度的对齐方法，适用于复杂现实生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

### [4] [Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558)
*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM是一个新颖的框架，通过重新编程视觉基础模型（VFMs）来解决时空预测任务中的时间建模和模态差距问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但在时空预测任务中，大型语言模型（LLMs）难以捕捉时空相关性。因此，需要一种新方法来利用视觉基础模型的强大空间先验。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过预VFM和后VFM两个重新编程阶段处理这些输入。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线方法，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务，并能适应不同的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

### [5] [Expert Operational GANS: Towards Real-Color Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11562)
*Ozer Can Devecioglu,Serkan Kiranyaz,Mehmet Yamac,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xOp-GAN提出了一种多生成器的GAN模型，通过专家生成器分别处理不同质量范围的图像，提升水下图像恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单生成器GAN难以应对水下图像恢复中的复杂退化问题，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 使用多个专家生成器，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，并通过判别器选择最佳恢复结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器设计和判别器的动态选择，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

### [6] [Data-Driven Meta-Analysis and Public-Dataset Evaluation for Sensor-Based Gait Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11571)
*Varun Velankar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过元分析和实验，评估了基于步态估计年龄的方法，发现多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），并分析了步态特征与年龄的相关性。深度学习模型表现最佳，准确率达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态年龄估计在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，但现有方法在真实场景中的性能尚不明确。

Method: 结合元分析（59项研究）和大规模实验（OU-ISIR和VersatileGait数据集），评估了CNN、惯性传感器等方法，并分析了步态特征与年龄的相关性。

Result: 多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），CNN准确率达96%。步态特征（如步长、速度）与年龄显著相关（相关系数≥0.27）。

Conclusion: 通过多传感器融合和深度学习，可将步态年龄估计误差降至3年以下，为实际应用提供了性能基准和实用指南。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

### [7] [What cat is that? A re-id model for feral cats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11575)
*Victor Caquilpan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用改进的PPGNet模型（PPGNet-Cat）通过图像重识别技术监测野生猫对澳大利亚野生动物的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生猫对澳大利亚野生动物造成严重威胁，需有效监测以减少其影响。

Method: 改进PPGNet模型为PPGNet-Cat，并探索对比学习方法如ArcFace损失。

Result: PPGNet-Cat表现优异，mAP达0.86，rank-1准确率为0.95。

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat在重识别领域具有竞争力，可用于野生猫监测。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

*Sathvik Chereddy,John Femiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchDNN提出了一种生成CAD草图的模型，通过统一的连续-离散扩散过程联合建模连续参数和离散类别标签。其核心创新是高斯-Softmax扩散，显著提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CAD草图中原始参数化的异质性和原始元素的排列不变性问题。

Method: 采用高斯-Softmax扩散，通过高斯噪声扰动的logits经softmax变换投影到概率单纯形，实现离散变量的混合类别标签。

Result: 在SketchGraphs数据集上，FID从16.04降至7.80，NLL从84.8降至81.33，达到CAD草图生成的最新水平。

Conclusion: SketchDNN通过创新的扩散过程，显著提升了CAD草图的生成质量，成为该领域的新标杆。

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a
unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is
Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch
generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

*Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Maryam Mohsin,Samuel D. Relton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）替代传统CNN，提高直肠癌淋巴结转移（LNM）分期的准确性，在MRI数据集上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于淋巴结大小、形状和纹理的放射学标准诊断准确性有限，VAE能直接编码视觉特征，生成更可解释的潜在空间。

Method: 提出VAE-MLP模型，利用VAE作为特征编码器，在168例未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集上验证。

Result: 模型性能优异，交叉验证指标为AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05，敏感性0.79 +/- 0.06，特异性0.85 +/- 0.05。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP在LNM分期中表现出色，为临床提供更准确的诊断工具。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85
+/- 0.05. Code is available at:

*Abhishek Jaiswal,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于姿势的心理状态推断方法，用于识别板球运动员的进攻或防守意图，通过运动分析达到较高准确率，并利用弱监督解决数据标注问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 姿势推断在诊断疲劳、预防伤害和提升表现方面潜力巨大，但面临数据敏感性问题。体育场景被视为获取多样化情感状态数据的可行替代方案。

Method: 在板球比赛中测试假设，通过运动分析从活动视频中识别人类意图，利用现有数据统计作为弱监督验证结果。

Result: 方法在区分进攻和防守意图时达到75% F1分数和80% AUC-ROC，表明姿势信号对意图推断有效。

Conclusion: 研究为体育分析提供了通用技术，并拓展了人类行为分析在其他领域的应用可能性。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

### [11] [VISTA: Monocular Segmentation-Based Mapping for Appearance and View-Invariant Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11653)
*Hannah Shafferman,Annika Thomas,Jouko Kinnari,Michael Ricard,Jose Nino,Jonathan How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一种新型的全局定位框架，通过对象分割和几何一致性实现跨视角和季节变化的稳定定位，性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无结构环境中因视角变化、季节变化等因素导致的定位挑战。

Method: 结合对象分割跟踪和子图对应搜索，利用几何一致性对齐参考帧。

Result: 在季节和斜视角数据集上，召回率提升69%，地图大小仅为基线方法的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA无需领域特定训练，适用于资源受限平台，实现了高效稳定的全局定位。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）与传统CNN-based OCR在户外广告文本识别中的表现，发现VLMs在场景理解上更优，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外广告文本识别在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR方法难以应对多变的环境和视觉噪声，而新兴的VLMs可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B、InternVL3和SmolVLM2等VLMs与轻量级CNN-based OCR（PaddleOCRv4）在ICDAR 2015和SVT数据集上的表现，并添加了合成天气失真以模拟真实场景。

Result: 结果显示，VLMs在整体场景推理上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具有竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 为促进未来研究，作者公开了天气增强的基准测试和评估代码，强调了轻量级CNN在边缘部署中的实用性。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

### [13] [Beyond Task-Specific Reasoning: A Unified Conditional Generative Framework for Abstract Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11761)
*Fan Shi,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的条件生成求解器（UCGS），用于解决多种抽象视觉推理（AVR）任务，避免了任务特定设计或参数的需求，并通过多任务训练实现了零样本推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计具有人类抽象视觉推理能力的智能系统是人工智能领域的长期目标，但现有方法通常需要任务特定设计或参数，增加了解决新任务的成本。

Method: 将一些已知的AVR任务重新表述为目标图像在问题面板中的可预测性问题，并通过训练一个条件生成模型来解决多种AVR任务。

Result: 实验表明，UCGS通过单轮多任务训练，在多种AVR任务中展现出抽象推理能力，并具备零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: UCGS提供了一种统一的框架，能够高效解决多种AVR任务，且无需针对新任务重新训练或调整模型架构。

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在密集对应点修剪中假设视觉域一致，忽视了场景多样性带来的挑战。

Method: 采用去风格化双分支处理域偏移，双融合专家混合模块适应场景多样性。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrMoE在跨域和跨场景的对应点修剪任务中表现出色，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at
https://github.com/peiwenxia/CorrMoE.

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用文本中的情感线索，且缺乏有效机制过滤无关面部动态。

Method: GRACE结合动态运动建模、语义文本细化（CATE模块）和基于熵正则化最优传输的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上显著提升识别性能，尤其在模糊或不平衡情感类别中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRACE通过细粒度跨模态对齐，实现了更精确的情感识别，确立了新的SOTA。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征以减少下采样时的失真，并在上采样时恢复细节，显著提升了语义分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息对语义分割至关重要，但在下采样过程中容易因混叠或失真而丢失。

Method: 采用自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征，结合多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）恢复高频信息。

Result: SFM有效减轻了混叠并保留了细节，适用于多种任务和架构。

Conclusion: SFM是一种通用且高效的方法，可广泛应用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 解决在行人监控系统中因数据不足而难以应对挑战性条件的问题。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟器和动态视觉传感器生成SEPose数据集，包含近350K标注行人姿态关键点。

Result: 在真实事件数据上测试了RVT和YOLOv8模型，展示了数据集的模拟到现实的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SEPose数据集为事件传感器在行人监控中的应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机在低光环境下难以捕捉清晰多视角图像，事件相机和高斯泼溅技术虽有潜力，但仍面临噪声和颜色不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，结合三重监督和颜色匹配模块，实现低光环境下的高质量重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有技术，成功重建辐射场。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS为低光环境下的多视角图像重建提供了有效解决方案，并发布了首个真实数据集。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

Result: 现有模型在识别视觉模式上表现有限，心理可视化能力仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 心理可视化是多模态大语言模型尚未解决的重要问题，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成多实例图像时，难以处理实例间的关系差异和多个属性的泄漏问题，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: RaDL通过可学习参数增强实例特定属性，并利用全局提示中的动作动词生成关系感知的图像特征。

Result: 在COCO-Position、COCO-MIG和DrawBench等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例间关系方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是生成多实例图像时同时考虑实例关系和多个属性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Motivation: 现实应用需要语义分割模型在未见过的目标域上表现良好，但现有方法在原型对齐和源数据利用上存在不足。

Method: 提出PPAR框架，定义OTP和VTP原型，采用渐进式对齐策略和原型重加权机制，减少域间隙并优化源数据贡献。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PPAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PPAR通过渐进式对齐和原型重加权，显著提升了语义分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked
Autoencoders (LG-CAV-MAE) to improve audio-visual representation learning.
LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更鲁棒和安全的MLLMs提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法在性能和效率之间难以平衡，要么调整文本提示开销大，要么手工视觉特征增强效果不稳定。

Method: GS-Bias引入全局偏差和空间偏差，直接添加到预训练模型的输出logits中，避免全反向传播，提高效率。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，例如在跨数据集泛化和领域泛化中分别提升2.23%和2.72%，内存使用仅为TPT的6.5%。

Conclusion: GS-Bias在高效性和性能上均优于现有TTA方法，为视觉语言模型的测试时适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Conclusion: EC-Diff在云-边协同框架中高效平衡了生成质量和推理速度。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

<details>

Motivation: 由于缺乏细粒度标签，部件级特征研究较少，现有无监督方法在跨类别和场景中缺乏稳健性。

Method: MPAE通过掩码自编码器学习部件描述符和特征图，利用局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，从而对齐部件形状。

Result: 实验表明，MPAE能在多种类别和场景中稳健地发现有意义部件，并支持跨类别部件相似性研究。

Conclusion: MPAE为无监督部件发现提供了更有效的范式，解决了遮挡和跨类别部件识别的挑战。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法能根据掩码成功实现区域特定的风格混合。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留各风格保真度的同时，实现了用户引导的区域风格控制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

Motivation: 当前Textual Inversion方法在个性化肖像生成中难以保持面部身份一致性，主要由于文本与视觉嵌入空间的语义不对齐。

Method: ID-EA包含ID-Enhancer和ID-Adapter：前者整合身份嵌入与文本锚点，后者调整预训练UNet模型的交叉注意力模块以保持身份。

Result: ID-EA在身份保持指标上显著优于现有方法，且计算效率高，生成速度比现有方法快约15倍。

Conclusion: ID-EA通过改进文本与视觉嵌入的对齐，有效解决了身份一致性问题，同时提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized

TL;DR: SAMST是一种半监督语义分割方法，利用Segment Anything Model（SAM）的零样本泛化和边界检测能力，通过迭代优化伪标签提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共遥感数据集因分辨率和土地覆盖类别定义不一致而缺乏普适性，需要利用大量未标记数据。

Method: SAMST结合监督模型自训练和基于SAM的伪标签细化器，后者包括阈值过滤模块、提示生成模块和标签细化模块。

Result: 在Potsdam数据集上的实验验证了SAMST的有效性和可行性。

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力和小模型的训练效率，解决了遥感语义分割中标记数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AUBlendSet数据集和AUBlendNet网络，用于基于面部动作单元（AUs）的细粒度3D面部表情操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D面部动画在细粒度风格化表情操纵方面存在挑战，主要由于缺乏合适的数据集。

Method: 引入AUBlendSet数据集（基于32个标准AUs的500个身份数据），并开发AUBlendNet网络，学习不同风格的AU-Blendshape基础向量。

Result: 通过实验验证了AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet在风格化表情操纵、语音驱动动画和情感识别数据增强中的有效性。

Conclusion: AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet填补了3D面部动画领域的空白，为任意身份的表情操纵提供了新工具。

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

### [32] [Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006)
*Linwei Chen,Lin Gu,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于电路理论的频率动态注意力调制（FDAM）方法，通过注意力反转和频率动态缩放解决ViTs中的频率消失问题，提升了多种任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs中的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理，需要一种方法来动态调整频率响应。

Method: 提出FDAM，包含注意力反转（AttInv）和频率动态缩放（FreqScale），通过互补高低通滤波和动态加权调整频率响应。

Result: 在多种模型（如SegFormer、DeiT、MaskDINO）和任务（语义分割、目标检测等）中表现提升，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM有效解决了ViTs的频率消失问题，提升了模型性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文将掩码图像建模（MIM）重新定义为稀疏信号重建问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码增强特征提取，无需预训练即可实现跨域分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将掩码视为图像变形，缺乏理论分析，未能充分利用掩码重建在特征提取中的潜力。

Method: 将掩码重建视为稀疏信号重建问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码一致性增强特征学习。

Result: 实验表明MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法，能提取域不变特征。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为域自适应分割提供了新范式，无需预训练即可实现跨域泛化。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用深度学习方法填补自然电影刺激与fMRI采集之间的时间分辨率差距，并探索视觉处理的神经机制。

Method: 采用时间卷积层的编码-解码架构，利用连续电影帧的时间相关性预测视觉皮层及周围体素的活动。

Result: 模型成功重建视觉输入，并发现中枕区、梭状区和距状区对解码贡献最大，分别对应形状感知、复杂识别（如面部）和基本视觉特征（如边缘和对比度）。

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习模型可作为探索视觉处理机制的工具，特别是在自然刺激条件下。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

Motivation: 现有方法将RGB域视为统一域，忽略了其多子域特性（如白天、夜晚、雾天），解耦域不变和域特定特征有助于RGB-IR域适应。

Method: 设计了光谱自适应幂等解耦模块（SAID），结合滤波器组光谱处理范式与自蒸馏解耦损失，实现更准确的光谱解耦；提出空间-光谱耦合方法，联合耦合域不变特征。

Conclusion: 解耦-耦合策略有效提升RGB-IR域自适应目标检测性能，光谱和空间特征的联合处理是关键。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

Motivation: 高质量开源数据集对深度学习发展至关重要，但面临被滥用的风险。现有验证技术主要针对监督模型和对比预训练模型，无法直接用于掩码模型。

Method: DOV4MM基于掩码信息在嵌入空间中的重构难度差异，验证可疑黑盒模型是否使用了目标数据集进行预训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上的实验表明，DOV4MM显著优于现有方法，p值远低于0.05。

Conclusion: DOV4MM为掩码模型的数据集所有权验证提供了首个有效解决方案，有助于保护数据集所有者的权益。

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture.

augmentation techniques and implement semantic filtering to ensure high-quality
data. Experiments on ScanQA demonstrate that 3D-MoRe significantly outperforms

Similarly, on ScanRefer, our approach achieves a notable increase in CIDEr@0.5

Conclusion: SGLoc通过结合语义信息和3DGS表示，实现了高效且准确的相机位姿估计，为无先验位姿的定位问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

Conclusion: IICMVNCD在多视图新类发现中表现优越，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

Result: 在多个域上显著超越现有最优模型（SOTA），减少训练冗余。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过结合VLMs和指令调优，有效提升了FAS系统的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

Result: 在四个基准测试中，MS-DETR表现优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: MS-DETR通过统一学习运动与语义特征，显著提升了视频时刻检索与高光检测的性能。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视角下的小型多目标跟踪面临特征稀缺、运动复杂和遮挡等挑战，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 采用跟踪-检测范式，提出SliceTrain训练增强框架和基于运动方向维护与自适应相似度度量的独立外观跟踪器。

Result: 在SMOT4SB测试集上达到SO-HOTA分数55.205，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂现实世界中的小型多目标跟踪问题，具有先进性和实用性。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的稀疏视图车辆3D重建方法，结合深度图和鲁棒的姿态估计架构，通过选择性光度损失和DUSt3R架构提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和Gaussian Splatting）依赖密集输入视图，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决稀疏视图下的车辆重建问题。

Method: 改进Gaussian Splatting，引入选择性光度损失（仅用于高置信度像素），并用DUSt3R架构替代传统SFM流程。同时提供合成和真实公共交通工具数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，能在输入受限条件下实现高质量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了稀疏视图下的车辆3D重建质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热浪对公共健康构成严重威胁，但现有路线系统因难以从卫星图像中直接估计阴影信息而未能纳入阴影数据。

Method: 通过Blender模拟生成阴影数据集，并结合扩散模型DeepShade学习阴影变化规律，利用RGB和边缘特征进行联合建模。

Result: DeepShade在生成阴影图像方面表现优异，并成功应用于实际路线规划中计算阴影比例。

Conclusion: 该研究为极端高温天气下的城市规划提供了参考，并具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Motivation: 医学图像分割网络在有限且不完美的数据集上容易误分类，OoD数据在其他视觉任务中表现优异，因此探索其在医学分割中的应用。

Method: 提出Med-OoD框架，通过OoD数据监督增强分割网络性能，无需外部数据、特征正则化目标或额外标注。

Result: 实验表明Med-OoD显著减少误分类，在Lizard数据集上性能提升，且仅用OoD数据训练的网络达到76.1% mIoU。

Conclusion: Med-OoD为医学分割提供新思路，展示了OoD数据的潜力，鼓励重新思考其作用。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人脸识别系统特征空间结构的新型对抗性人脸生成方法，无需迭代优化，仅需少量查询即可高效攻击商业系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性攻击对人脸识别系统构成严重威胁，现有方法依赖迭代优化或迁移性，效率低且不适用于商业系统。

Method: 利用特征空间中相同属性个体形成的子空间，生成视觉差异大但被识别为目标身份的对抗性人脸。

Result: 仅需100张人脸图像的单次非自适应查询，攻击AWS CompareFaces API的成功率超过93%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且灵活，能生成具有特定属性的对抗性人脸，为防御提供了新挑战。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Method: 提出LidarPainter，一种一步扩散模型，利用稀疏LiDAR条件和损坏渲染实时恢复一致视图。

Result: 实验表明，LidarPainter在速度、质量和资源效率上优于现有方法，速度快7倍且GPU内存需求仅为五分之一。

Conclusion: LidarPainter不仅支持高保真重建，还能通过文本提示生成多样化风格，扩展资产库。

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

environment over a Hierarchical Scene Graph derived from sequences of RGB-D
frames utilizing a set of open-vocabulary foundation models and sensor data

across floors, rooms, locations, and objects. To effectively address complex
queries involving spatial reference to other objects, we integrate the
hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.
This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer
(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual
understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of
hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor
scenes. Our approach demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust
object grounding compared to existing methods. Overall OVIGo-3DHSG demonstrates
strong potential for applications requiring spatial reasoning and understanding

TL;DR: BSPF-ViT通过联合优化Q/K令牌的剪枝和融合，减少ViT的计算成本，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT的高计算成本限制了实际应用，现有方法独立剪枝Q/K令牌导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion (BSPF-ViT)，联合评估令牌及其邻居，保留关键令牌并通过相似性融合压缩。

Result: 在DeiT-T和DeiT-S上分别提升1.3%和2.0%的ImageNet分类准确率，计算开销减少50%，速度提升40%。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT在剪枝效率和性能之间取得平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Motivation: 现有双边网格方法仅支持线性变换，无法处理复杂颜色关系；传统MLP方法参数全局共享，难以适应局部变化。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: BPAM框架有效结合了双边网格的空间建模和MLP的非线性能力，提升了图像增强效果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

Result: 在真实和合成图像上的实验表明，该方法在光照调整和高频信息恢复方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，有效提升了低光立体图像的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Conclusion: AD-GS为高质量自由视角渲染提供了一种高效且无需标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in
recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior
over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or
low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible
density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the
challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily
reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via
ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for
integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: TGDA展示了作为预训练替代方案的潜力，为高效细粒度视觉系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Conclusion: 双集成框架有效提高了脑肿瘤分类的准确性，各组件对结果均有贡献。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习模型通过出生24小时内的胸部X光片预测极低出生体重婴儿的中/重度支气管肺发育不良（BPD）结局，AUROC为0.78。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是极低出生体重婴儿常见的慢性肺病，预防措施可能带来严重风险，因此早期预测至关重要。

Method: 采用ResNet-50模型，结合渐进层冻结、线性探测和CutMix增强技术，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片进行预测。

Result: 模型AUROC为0.78，显著优于ImageNet初始化和传统IRDS分级。

Conclusion: 领域特定的预训练和优化方法能有效预测BPD结局，适合临床推广。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Method: 通过优化视角重新解释扩散采样，引入RODS方法，利用损失景观的几何线索检测和纠正高风险步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上，RODS能检测70%以上的幻觉样本并纠正25%以上，同时避免引入新伪影。

Conclusion: RODS显著提升了扩散模型的采样鲁棒性和保真度，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

Method: 扩展了VQA数据集为DD-VQA+，并提出了MGFFD-VLM框架，结合属性驱动的混合LoRA策略和多粒度提示学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本伪造判断和分析上优于现有方法，准确率更高。

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架通过改进数据集和训练策略，显著提升了伪造检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: 生成式模型在医学影像短语定位中表现更优，为临床实践提供了更可靠和可解释的工具。

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Method: 提出了一个标注视频数据集，并采用基线方法进行技能时间分割。

Result: 结果显示问题可行，但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究为健美操领域的自动化工具开发提供了初步基础。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

Motivation: 研究扩散模型成功的原因，发现输入条件是关键，因此探索理想的表示方法应具备高保真度、易生成性和组合性。

Method: 引入离散潜在代码（DLC），一种基于自监督学习的图像表示，通过序列化离散标记替代连续嵌入，提升扩散模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: DLC是一种高效的图像表示方法，显著提升扩散模型的生成能力，并扩展其应用范围至文本到图像生成。

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Conclusion: CueCo通过整合对比学习和聚类，为无监督视觉表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18
backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new

Result: FADE在概念移除和图像质量方面优于现有方法，性能提升5-10%。

Conclusion: FADE为安全公平的生成建模设定了新标准，无需从头训练即可删除指定概念。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅性能优越，模块化设计还便于未来改进和实际应用适配。

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with

expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上显著提升用户偏好对齐。

Conclusion: QuRe有效解决了假阴性问题，提升了组合图像检索的性能和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

Method: 采用YOLO11x作为教师模型，YOLO11n作为学生模型，通过CWD和MGD方法进行知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验显示，CWD和MGD分别提升了2.5%和1.9%的mAP50，且未增加模型复杂度。

Conclusion: CWD和MGD是提升深度学习杂草检测准确性的有效、高效且实用的方法。

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

### [74] [Text-driven Multiplanar Visual Interaction for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12382)
*Kaiwen Huang,Yi Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yizhe Zhang,Chen Gong,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Text-SemiSeg的文本驱动多平面视觉交互框架，用于半监督医学图像分割，通过文本增强视觉特征，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督医学图像分割能降低标注成本，但现有研究很少利用文本数据增强视觉语义嵌入。

Method: 框架包含三个模块：文本增强多平面表示（TMR）、类别感知语义对齐（CSA）和动态认知增强（DCA）。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg通过文本与视觉特征的交互，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更高效和鲁棒的目标检测架构提供了基准和实验设置。

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RadGazeIntent的深度学习模型，旨在捕捉放射科医生在解读医学图像时的意图驱动行为，通过处理眼动数据预测其诊断目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型未能捕捉放射科医生在图像解读中每个注视点背后的意图，而理解这种意图对改进医学图像分析至关重要。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的架构，处理眼动数据的时空维度，将其转化为诊断意图的粗粒度表示，并基于医学眼动数据集创建了三个意图标记子集（RadSeq、RadExplore、RadHybrid）。

Result: RadGazeIntent在所有意图标记数据集上均优于基线方法，能够准确预测放射科医生在特定时刻关注的发现。

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功建模了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

### [77] [InterpIoU: Rethinking Bounding Box Regression with Interpolation-Based IoU Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12420)
*Haoyuan Liu,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数InterpIoU，通过插值框解决IoU在非重叠情况下的不可微问题，并避免传统几何惩罚的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU损失函数依赖手工设计的几何惩罚，对小物体检测效果不佳且可能导致边界框扩大。

Method: 提出InterpIoU，利用插值框与目标框的IoU作为损失项，并进一步提出动态调整插值系数的Dynamic InterpIoU。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在小物体检测中效果显著。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了传统IoU损失的局限性，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的视频识别网络DVFL-Net，通过知识蒸馏和时空特征调制，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在视频识别中表现出色，但计算成本高，难以在设备上高效部署。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制技术，将大型教师模型的知识迁移到小型学生模型中。

Result: DVFL-Net在多个基准测试中表现优异，实现了性能和效率的平衡。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net是实时视频识别应用的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究假设区域级描述能力对VQA任务（尤其是涉及密集文本图像的场景）有益，因此开发了DAM-QA框架。

Method: DAM-QA引入多区域视图机制，聚合图像内容的区域描述，以更有效地识别与文本相关的证据。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中，DAM-QA表现优于基线DAM，DocVQA上提升7分以上，且参数更少。

Conclusion: DAM-QA展示了区域感知模型在文本丰富VQA任务中的潜力，并缩小了与通用视觉语言模型的差距。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在跨模态理解中存在幻觉问题，现有方法成本高或引入数据分布不匹配。

Result: 实验显示SENTINEL减少90%以上的幻觉，在幻觉和通用能力基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SENTINEL在减少幻觉和保持模型性能方面表现出色，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Abstract: We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for
monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf
components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a
high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D

with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable
training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed
RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and

Result: CytoSAE能识别形态学相关概念，生成患者和疾病特异性概念，在AML分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学图像提供可解释性工具，性能与现有技术相当，且具有亚细胞级解释能力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

TL;DR: 研究将大语言模型（LLMs）作为“主观文学评论家”，探索其在文学评估中的审美偏好和评价模式。通过分析十篇日本科幻短篇小说的翻译文本，发现LLMs的评价存在显著差异和五种独特模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文学评估中是否具有类似人类批评家的个体化评价特征，而非中立基准工具。

Method: 将十篇日本科幻小说翻译成英文，由六种先进LLMs在七个独立会话中评估，使用主成分分析和聚类技术分析数据。

Result: 发现评价一致性差异显著（α值1.00至0.35），五种评价模式，且不同模型具有独特的评价词汇。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备类似人类批评家的个体化评价特征，而非单纯的中立评估工具。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

### [88] [MapIQ: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Map Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11625)
*Varun Srivastava,Fan Lei,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Vivek Gupta,Ross Maciejewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MapIQ是一个包含14,706个问答对的数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）中的表现，涵盖三种地图类型和六个主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Map-VQA研究主要关注choropleth地图，覆盖的主题和任务有限，需要更全面的评估基准。

Method: 引入MapIQ数据集，评估多种MLLMs在六种视觉分析任务中的表现，并与人类基线对比。还研究了地图设计变化对模型的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了MLLMs的鲁棒性、敏感性及其对内部地理知识的依赖，为提升Map-VQA性能提供了方向。

Conclusion: MapIQ填补了Map-VQA研究的空白，为未来改进MLLMs在地图理解方面的能力提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在波斯语中使用少样本学习和增量学习方法进行跨语言情感分析，目标是利用高资源语言的知识开发一个能在有限数据下工作的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在波斯语中进行情感分析的模型，利用高资源语言的知识，同时仅需少量波斯语数据。

Method: 使用三种预训练多语言模型（XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT），通过少样本和增量学习方法在小样本波斯语数据上进行微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa表现最佳，达到96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型是有效的。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

TL;DR: PgM框架通过模态分区器将多模态表示分为单模态和配对模态特征，分别学习并重构，适用于多种下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，单模态和配对模态特征的分离学习能提升表示能力，适应不同任务需求。

Method: PgM包含模态分区器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和单配对模态解码器，分别处理特征学习和重构。

Result: 实验证明PgM在四种多模态任务中有效，且具有迁移性，可视化展示了特征的分布和贡献。

Conclusion: PgM通过分离学习单模态和配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Conclusion: ExpliCIT-QA为敏感领域的表格问答系统提供了可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRABS的方法，结合浅层语法分析和LLM，用于理解Python笔记本的信息流和执行依赖关系，解决了LLM在长上下文和幻觉问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据科学和机器学习Python笔记本的复杂性和依赖性问题，直接重新执行笔记本以理解其信息流和操作往往不切实际。LLM虽然能理解代码，但在处理实际笔记本时存在幻觉和长上下文挑战。

Method: 提出CRABS方法，结合浅层语法分析（AST）和LLM的零样本学习，捕获笔记本的上下界估计，并通过LLM解决剩余歧义，生成信息流图和执行依赖图。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本上评估，LLM解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和执行依赖识别上的F1分数分别达到98%和99%。

Conclusion: CRABS方法有效解决了笔记本理解的挑战，结合语法分析和LLM的优势，显著提高了信息流和依赖关系的识别准确性。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Result: 情感特征显著提升了性能，尤其在主观F1分数上，团队在希腊语任务中排名第一（Macro F1 = 0.51）。

Conclusion: 情感特征的集成和阈值校准是提升多语言主观性检测任务性能的有效策略。

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

Motivation: 研究动机是复现并调和Ortu等人、Yu、Merullo、Pavlick以及McDougall等人的三项近期研究，这些研究通过机械解释工具探讨了模型学习的事实与矛盾上下文信息之间的竞争。

Method: 方法包括分析注意力头强度与事实输出比率的关系，评估关于注意力头抑制机制的竞争性假设，并研究这些注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 研究发现，促进事实输出的注意力头通过通用的复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制实现其功能，且其行为具有领域依赖性，较大模型表现出更专业化和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 结论表明注意力头的行为是领域依赖的，且其抑制机制更倾向于通用性而非选择性。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Result: 基线模型在语言识别任务中表现与最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: 该研究为印度语言的语言识别提供了数据集和基线模型，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了自回归模型的顺序限制，显著提升了生成效率，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Conclusion: DualReward框架能有效平衡从可靠人工示例中学习与探索高质量干扰项，适用于自动化测试生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部将“有害性”与“拒绝”编码为独立概念，并提出“有害性方向”作为新的安全机制分析维度。通过操控这一方向，可以揭示LLMs对指令的理解，并开发出“Latent Guard”作为内在安全防护工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正理解“有害性”而非仅机械拒绝，并分析其内部安全机制。

Method: 识别“有害性方向”与“拒绝方向”的区别，通过操控方向验证LLMs对指令的判断，并开发“Latent Guard”作为安全应用。

Result: 发现LLMs对“有害性”的理解比拒绝行为更稳定，且“Latent Guard”在检测不安全输入和减少过度拒绝方面表现优异。

Conclusion: LLMs内部对“有害性”的理解具有鲁棒性，为AI安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

### [103] [POLYCHARTQA: Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models with Multilingual Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11939)
*Yichen Xu,Liangyu Chen,Liang Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyChartQA是首个大规模多语言图表问答基准，覆盖10种语言的22,606张图表和26,151个问答对，旨在解决现有基准的英语中心化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要基于英语，限制了其全球适用性。PolyChartQA旨在填补这一空白，推动多语言图表理解的发展。

Method: 采用解耦流水线，分离图表数据和渲染代码，通过翻译数据和重用代码生成多语言图表，并利用LLM翻译和严格质量控制确保一致性。

Result: 实验显示，英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为全球包容性视觉语言模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

*Amos You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BlockBPE是一种并行GPU实现的BPE算法，优化了高吞吐量批量推理，比现有方法快2-2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU绑定的BPE实现（如HuggingFace Tokenizers和tiktoken）在GPU批量推理中效率低下，BlockBPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词步骤，实现线程块内的高度并行化分词合并，将复杂度从O(n log n)降至O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE显著提升了GPU批量推理的效率，尽管牺牲了少量生成质量。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合信息熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，从而实现细粒度的提示压缩。实验表明DAC在多领域任务和大型语言模型中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了算法层面的注意力关键令牌和压缩过程中信息熵的变化。DAC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出动态注意力感知方法（DAC），结合熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化。

Result: 在LongBench、GSM8K和BBH等多个领域的实验中，DAC表现稳健且显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAC通过动态整合熵和注意力信息，实现了高效的提示压缩，为任务无关的提示压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

*Yi Zhao,Zuchao Li,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IAM框架通过利用不同规模LLM间注意力矩阵的高相似性，优化注意力计算和KV缓存使用，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在长上下文中的资源消耗问题严重，现有方法主要依赖模型内部稀疏性，未利用外部信息优化。

Method: 提出IAM框架，通过分析注意力矩阵相似性、选择映射层和验证一致性，实现小规模与大规模LLM间的注意力映射。

Result: 实验显示IAM可加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且性能损失小，适用于多种模型。

Conclusion: IAM是一种通用且与现有KV缓存优化方法正交的高效工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于查询的多阶段知识图谱问答框架，用于提升多跳和时间问题的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多跳推理和时间问题上表现不佳，而基于查询的知识图谱问答（KGQA）提供了一种模块化替代方案。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多跳和时间问答数据集上表现优异，且适用于小型语言模型。

Conclusion: 基于查询的多阶段KGQA框架在多跳和时间问答任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Large language models excel in question-answering (QA) yet still struggle
with multi-hop reasoning and temporal questions. Query-based knowledge graph QA
(KGQA) offers a modular alternative by generating executable queries instead of
direct answers. We explore multi-stage query-based framework for WikiData QA,
proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging
multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection
studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method
using CoT reasoning. Our results demonstrate the potential of query-based

*Xinyu Wang,Vahid Partovi Nia,Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的PoT量化框架，用于LLM权重，在极低精度下优于现有技术，并通过高效反量化加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs部署因计算资源需求高而困难，现有PoT量化在GPU上效果不佳。

Method: 提出两步骤后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并校准优化。

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下优于现有整数量化，反量化速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 新型PoT量化框架在低精度下高效且准确，适用于LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，标准翻译系统难以处理低资源语言和方言中的俚语、混合代码及有害言论的文化标记，尤其是在毒性内容翻译方面。

Method: 1. 人工验证的少样本提示工程，筛选和排序新加坡英语示例；2. 通过语义相似度基准测试优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了框架的有效性和效率，提升了翻译质量并支持文化敏感的审核。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了翻译质量，还强调了在内容审核等实际应用中保留社会语言细微差别的重要性。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与LLM在语言理解上的差异，尤其是在推理、情感解释和信息检索等功能任务中的应用。

Method: 使用LLM将阅读材料中的单词分组为节点和边，构建基于语义和问题导向的图结构，并通过眼动数据验证重要节点和边的注视分布。

Result: LLM在图拓扑结构层面表现出高度一致的语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持人类与AI协同学习的策略，并扩展了先前的研究发现。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证价值相似性在人工社会中是否与人类社会一样影响关系建立。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值的可控性；主实验生成具有特定价值的代理对并分析对话后的信任和亲密感。

Result: 高价值相似性的代理对表现出更强的信任和亲密感。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并揭示价值影响关系建立的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，简化大型语言模型（LLM）对多义词的定义会降低完整性，增加误解风险。通过微调Llama 3.1 8B模型，可以显著提升定义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨简化定义对不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）的影响，尤其是多义词的定义可能因简化而丢失关键信息。

Method: 使用DeepSeek v3、Llama 4 Maverick等模型，通过LLM-as-Judge和人工标注，评估简化对多义词定义质量的影响。

Result: 简化显著降低定义的完整性，忽略多义性；微调Llama 3.1 8B模型显著提升了定义质量。

Conclusion: 教育类NLP需平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保为所有学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Motivation: 研究旨在比较人类和LLMs在语言创造力方面的表现，特别是在生成新词和短语的能力上。

Method: 设计了基于构词法（派生和复合）和隐喻语言使用的测试任务，对24名人类和24个LLMs进行评估，使用OCSAI工具自动评分（原创性、精细度和灵活性）。

Result: LLMs在所有评估标准中均优于人类，并在八项任务中的六项表现更好；人类更倾向于扩展性创造力（E-creativity），而LLMs偏向固定性创造力（F-creativity）。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言创造力方面表现突出，但人类和LLMs在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF填补了书籍规模共指消解基准的空白，揭示了当前模型在长文本上的挑战，并开源了数据和代码。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

*Payal Bhattad,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao,Anju Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）文本增强的框架，包括可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），验证了GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率上的最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保真和稳定性上的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时。

Method: 提出两个评估组件：可扩展性分析和IASR，用于量化语义一致性和递归改写中的语义漂移。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo表现最佳，应用于BERTopic任务时，主题粒度提升400%且完全消除主题重叠。

Conclusion: 验证了所提框架在实际NLP流程中评估LLM增强的实用性。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

### [120] [Overview of the Sensemaking Task at the ELOQUENT 2025 Lab: LLMs as Teachers, Students and Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12143)
*Pavel Šindelář,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT的Sensemaking任务评估生成语言模型在三个步骤中的表现：问题生成、问题回答和答案评分，发现仍需改进问题生成和答案限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过共享任务评估生成语言模型的高层次能力，特别是在文本理解方面的表现。

Method: 采用三步评估框架（问题生成、回答、评分），使用多语言和多来源测试材料，并对比自动与手动评估。

Result: 发现LLMs在问题回答中表现尚可，但在问题生成和答案限制方面存在问题，且评分系统易受干扰。

Conclusion: 需改进问题生成评估策略和答案限制机制，评分系统需更稳健。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述可能的翻译行为模式，并通过分析击键和注视数据揭示隐藏的认知过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究翻译行为背后的认知和情感状态，以更好地理解翻译过程中的动态变化。

Method: 通过记录击键和注视数据，构建多层次的BTSS，并将其用于计算翻译代理的模拟。

Result: BTSS能够模拟翻译过程中情感、自动行为和认知的时序动态。

Conclusion: BTSS为翻译行为研究提供了新的框架，并可用于开发计算翻译代理。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

*Reuben Smit,Retief Louw,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索了一种在低资源环境下无需自动语音识别（ASR）的孤立词阅读评估方法，通过对比儿童语音与少量成人参考模板，使用自监督学习（SSL）模型编码，发现SSL特征在儿童语音处理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境中，传统的自动语音识别（ASR）方法难以应用，因此需要探索无需ASR的评估方法，尤其是针对儿童语音的评估。

Method: 采用少样本学习方法，将儿童语音输入与少量成人参考模板进行比较，利用SSL模型的中间层进行编码，并研究了离散化SSL特征和模板质心平均等设计选项。

Result: 实验显示，成人语音表现良好，但儿童语音输入性能显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表征在低资源语音任务中表现优异，但在少样本分类系统中处理儿童数据时存在明显局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

*Shilin Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，利用LLM提升ASR关键词识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时表现不佳，传统方法各有局限性。

Method: 采用多粒度融合方法，结合词级和短语级融合，通过延迟融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识结合。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上实现了关键词相关指标的最优性能，同时保持非关键词文本的高准确率。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架显著提升了关键词识别性能，词级和短语级组件相互补充，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

*Yikang Liu,Wanyang Zhang,Yiming Wang,Jialong Tang,Pei Zhang,Baosong Yang,Fei Huang,Rui Wang,Hai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-index的量化指标，用于测量翻译文本中的翻译腔（translationese），并通过对比微调的语言模型计算。实验表明T-index在跨域设置中具有泛化能力，并与人类判断一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 翻译腔（translationese）是翻译文本中的一种特征，但缺乏量化测量方法。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用对比微调的语言模型计算T-index，并通过合成数据集和真实翻译数据集评估其泛化能力和有效性。

Result: T-index在少量数据微调后即可有效捕捉翻译腔，与人类标注的翻译腔程度相关性较高（Pearson's r = 0.568），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种稳健且高效的翻译腔测量指标，可作为现有MT质量评估指标的补充。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Infherno的端到端框架，利用LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，将自由形式的临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源，解决了现有方法的泛化性和结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如模块化规则系统或指令调优的LLM）在将临床笔记转换为FHIR资源时存在泛化性不足和结构不一致的问题，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Infherno框架，结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，实现端到端的转换，并支持自定义和合成数据的前端。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源方面表现良好，与人工基准相当，并支持跨机构的临床数据集成和互操作性。

Conclusion: Infherno框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为临床数据集成和互操作性提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

Motivation: 文本异常检测缺乏标准化和全面的基准测试，限制了方法的比较和创新。

Result: 嵌入质量显著影响异常检测效果，深度学习模型与传统方法在LLM嵌入下表现相当；跨模型性能矩阵呈现低秩特性。

Conclusion: 开源基准工具包为未来研究提供了基础，嵌入质量是异常检测的关键因素。

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了现有代码大语言模型（LLMs）在VHDL代码生成和摘要任务中的表现，发现其性能不足，并提出了一种名为Chain-of-Descriptions（CoDes）的新方法以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中广泛应用，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）中的研究和优化仍不足。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤（基于问题陈述或VHDL代码）来增强LLMs的输入提示，从而提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在VHDL-Eval和VHDL-Xform数据集上显著优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅提高了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量，还为未来优化代码LLMs提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的影响，为开发更公平的AD检测模型提供依据。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中文和希腊语语音的感知实验，结合声学分析（如shimmer值和语音部分）。

Result: 男性语音更频繁被识别为AD，shimmer值与AD感知显著相关，语言对AD感知无显著影响。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在模型开发中解决，并进一步验证跨语言性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在处理用户请求时的模糊性问题，提升交互系统的清晰度。

Method: 采用三种LLM架构（Llama3-8B、Gemma2-9B和Mistral-7B变体）和一个多样化模糊性数据集，设计多智能体辩论框架。

Result: 辩论框架显著提升了Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B的性能，其中Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率高达76.7%。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架是增强LLM能力的有效方法，为开发更鲁棒和自适应的语言理解系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究了具备网页浏览能力的大语言模型（LLMs）能否通过用户名推断社交媒体用户的 demographic 属性，并探讨了其潜在的应用与风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖静态数据，而具备网页浏览能力的LLMs可以实时获取信息。然而，LLMs是否能直接检索和分析社交媒体数据尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用合成数据集（48个X/Twitter账户）和调查数据集（1,384名国际参与者），评估LLMs访问社交媒体内容并预测用户demographic属性的能力。

Result: LLMs能够以合理准确度预测用户demographic属性，但分析显示模型可能对低活跃度账户引入性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: 此能力对计算社会科学有潜力，但也存在滥用风险（如信息操作和定向广告）。建议LLM提供商限制公开应用中的此类功能，同时保留受控访问供研究使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否可用于检测算术错误，以实现轻量级的自我纠正。

Method: 使用简单探针解码隐藏状态，训练错误检测器，并在简单和复杂算术任务中验证其效果。

Result: 探针能准确解码预测和正确答案，错误检测器准确率超90%，且能泛化到复杂任务，通过选择性重新提示提高准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为轻量级自我纠正提供可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据过滤，显著提升了企业数据的检索和生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业依赖专有数据决策，但现有LLMs和RAG在处理异构数据时存在局限。

Method: 采用混合检索（密集嵌入和BM25）、元数据过滤、语义分块和量化索引，结合人工反馈优化。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，Faithfulness等定性指标显著提高。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了企业任务的准确性和相关性，未来将扩展至多模态数据和代理检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

Motivation: 探讨是否可以利用推理链（CoT）来预测最终回答的偏差，以减少有害内容的产生。

Method: 评估了多种监控方法，包括人类、大型语言模型和文本分类器，比较了基于文本和激活状态的方法。

Result: 线性探针在CoT激活状态上的表现显著优于文本方法，且能在推理早期预测安全性。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可用于实时安全监控和早期干预，适用于不同规模和类型的模型。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

*Suman Adhya,Debarshi Kumar Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S2WTM通过使用球形Sliced-Wasserstein距离解决VAE-NTMs中的后验崩溃问题，提升了主题建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE-NTMs在处理高维文本数据时存在后验崩溃问题，导致潜在表示失效。

Method: 提出S2WTM，利用球形Sliced-Wasserstein距离对齐后验分布与先验分布。

Result: S2WTM在生成连贯且多样的主题上优于现有模型，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: S2WTM有效解决了后验崩溃问题，提升了主题建模的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BETR的显式优化数据选择方法，通过将预训练数据与评估基准对齐，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索显式优化数据选择方法的效果，以解决实践中通过基准驱动迭代隐含目标的问题。

Method: 提出BETR方法，通过嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全库分数。

Result: 实验结果显示，BETR在10项任务中的9项上表现优于基线，计算效率提升2.1倍，且能泛化到不同基准。

Conclusion: 结论表明，直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且选择策略需根据模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of

backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的验证方法，用于评估代理行为轨迹，并发现其存在“同意偏差”问题。通过自接地验证（SGV）方法，显著提升了验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用）中，如何将人类直觉转化为可扩展的验证规则是一个挑战。MLLMs因其世界知识和对齐人类偏好的能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出自接地验证（SGV）方法，通过无条件生成和条件生成两步，利用MLLMs自身的采样机制优化验证过程。

Result: SGV方法使MLLM验证器的准确率提升高达20个百分点，并在多个任务中实现实时监督，显著提升任务完成率。

Conclusion: SGV方法有效解决了MLLMs的同意偏差问题，显著提升了验证性能，为复杂领域中的代理行为评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

<details>

Motivation: 动态规划（DP）建模传统上需要专家知识，LLMs有潜力自动化这一过程，但面临数据稀缺和随机性挑战。

Method: 引入DP-Bench基准和DPLM模型，采用DualReflect合成数据生成方法，结合前向和后向生成。

Conclusion: 结合前向和后向生成的数据方法在动态规划问题中具有互补优势，DPLM为自动化DP建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

Conclusion: Aime为多智能体协作提供了更灵活、高效的基础框架。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Result: 智能体主要关注光流不连续区域和大光流区域，行为类似昆虫飞行，且该策略在不同训练智能体中一致。

Conclusion: 该策略可能适用于开发简单明确的物理无人机控制法则。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future

provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Result: Xiangqi-R1模型在合法移动和准确性上分别提升18%和22%，优于通用LLMs。

Conclusion: 为复杂空间领域的通用战略智能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these

### [149] [State-based approach to the numerical solution of Dirichlet boundary optimal control problems for the Laplace equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11646)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Dirichlet边界控制问题中控制空间与状态空间的关系，以及如何通过正则化和有限元方法优化控制效果。

Method: 采用$H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$范数作为控制成本，结合正则化和有限元误差估计，优化网格尺寸$h$与正则化参数$\varrho$的关系。

Result: 提出了控制成本与近似精度之间的最优平衡关系，并通过数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和数值实验，证明了方法的有效性，特别是在带有盒约束的情况下。

Abstract: We investigate the Dirichlet boundary control of the Laplace equation,
considering the control in $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, which is the natural
space for Dirichlet data when the state belongs to $H^1(\Omega)$. The cost of
the control is measured in the $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm that also plays
the role of the regularization term. We discuss regularization and finite
element error estimates enabling us to derive an optimal relation between the
finite element mesh size $h$ and the regularization parameter $\varrho$,
balancing the energy cost for the control and the accuracy of the approximation
of the desired state. This relationship is also crucial in designing efficient
solvers. We also discuss additional box constraints imposed on the control and
the state. Our theoretical findings are complemented by numerical examples,
including one example with box constraints.

Abstract: We introduce a family of discontinuous Galerkin methods to approximate the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a Stokes-Brinkman type of problem based in
the interior penalty strategy. Under the standard assumptions on the meshes and
a suitable norm, we prove the stability of the discrete scheme. Due to the
non-conforming nature of the method, we use the well-known non-compact
operators theory to derive convergence and error estimates for the method. We
present an exhaustive computational analysis where we compute the spectrum with
different stabilization parameters with the aim of study its influence when the
spectrum is approximated.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于一维非线性薛定谔方程的规范稳定虚时演化方法，通过自适应反馈项避免显式归一化，提高了算法灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚时演化方法需要显式归一化波函数，破坏算法灵活性，因此提出了一种无需外部归一化的自调节方法。

Method: 引入自适应反馈项mu(tau)，与波函数规范的时间导数成比例，实现连续稳定演化。

Result: 方法在波函数轮廓和L2误差上优于基线方法，收敛于孤子解。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于高维系统，未来将研究其在多维、多孤子和外势场中的应用。

Abstract: We present a norm-stabilized imaginary-time evolution (ITE) scheme for the
one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). Traditional ITE solvers
often require explicit renormalization of the wavefunction after each step to
preserve norm, which can be disruptive and algorithmically inflexible. We
propose an alternative approach in which the evolution is continuously
stabilized using an adaptive feedback term mu(tau), proportional to the time
derivative of the wavefunction norm. This results in a self-regulating flow
that requires no external normalization while preserving convergence toward
soliton solutions. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness by comparing the
final wavefunction profiles and L2 errors against analytical solutions and
baseline methods without feedback. Although this work focuses on the 1D case,
the framework is designed to extend naturally to higher dimensions. Future work
will explore the behavior of the feedback mechanism in 2D and 3D systems,
multi-soliton scenarios, and external potentials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学计算中，许多问题的解是通过缓慢收敛的迭代序列逼近的，因此需要加速技术来提高效率。

Method: 介绍了基于外推法和固定点映射的加速方法，如AA、Quasi-Newton和Inexact Newton方法。

Result: 这些方法在物理等领域中表现出高效性，尤其是AA方法。

Conclusion: 固定点迭代加速技术（如AA）是提高收敛速度的有效工具。

Abstract: A pervasive approach in scientific computing is to express the solution to a
given problem as the limit of a sequence of vectors or other mathematical
objects. In many situations these sequences are generated by slowly converging
iterative procedures and this led practitioners to seek faster alternatives to
reach the limit. ``Acceleration techniques'' comprise a broad array of methods
specifically designed with this goal in mind. They started as a means of
improving the convergence of general scalar sequences by various forms of
``extrapolation to the limit'', i.e., by extrapolating the most recent iterates
to the limit via linear combinations. Extrapolation methods of this type, the
best known example of which is Aitken's Delta-squared process, require only the
sequence of vectors as input. However, limiting methods to only use the
iterates is too restrictive. Accelerating sequences generated by fixed-point
iterations by utilizing both the iterates and the fixed-point mapping itself
has proven highly successful across various areas of physics. A notable example
of these Fixed-Point accelerators (FP-Accelerators) is a method developed by D.
Anderson in 1965 and now widely known as Anderson Acceleration (AA).
Furthermore, Quasi-Newton and Inexact Newton methods can also be placed in this
category as well. This paper presents an overview of these methods -- with an
emphasis on those, such as AA, that are geared toward accelerating fixed point
iterations.

Conclusion: 该拟插值算子具有广泛适用性和高效性，为有限元方法提供了新的理论和实践工具。

Abstract: We design a quasi-interpolation operator from the Sobolev space
$H^1_0(\Omega)$ to its finite-dimensional finite element subspace formed by
piecewise polynomials on a simplicial mesh with a computable approximation
constant. The operator 1) is defined on the entire $H^1_0(\Omega)$, no
additional regularity is needed; 2) allows for an arbitrary polynomial degree;
3) works in any space dimension; 4) is defined locally, in vertex patches of
mesh elements; 5) yields optimal estimates for both the $H^1$ seminorm and the
$L^2$ norm error; 6) gives a computable constant for both the $H^1$ seminorm
and the $L^2$ norm error; 7) leads to the equivalence of global-best and
local-best errors; 8) possesses the projection property. Its construction
follows the so-called potential reconstruction from a posteriori error
analysis. Numerical experiments illustrate that our quasi-interpolation
operator systematically gives the correct convergence rates in both the $H^1$
seminorm and the $L^2$ norm and its certified overestimation factor is rather
sharp and stable in all tested situations.

of backward Euler full discretization with a sum-of-exponentials (SOE)
approximation for the convolution integral, and derive error estimates for the
semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes. Finally, we provide several numerical
examples to verify the theoretical results.

Conclusion: DA-RKHS提供了一种自动、高效的核选择方法，显著提升了核方法的性能。

Abstract: Learning convolution kernels in operators from data arises in numerous
applications and represents an ill-posed inverse problem of broad interest.
With scant prior information, kernel methods offer a natural nonparametric
approach with regularization. However, a major challenge is to select a proper
reproducing kernel, especially as operators and data vary. We show that the
input data and convolution operator themselves induce an automatic,
data-adaptive RKHS (DA-RKHS), obviating manual kernel selection. In particular,
when the observation data is discrete and finite, there is a finite set of
automatic basis functions sufficient to represent the estimators in the
DA-RKHS, including the minimal-norm least-squares, Tikhonov, and
conjugate-gradient estimators. We develop both Tikhonov and scalable iterative
and hybrid algorithms using the automatic basis functions. Numerical
experiments on integral, nonlocal, and aggregation operators confirm that our
automatic RKHS regularization consistently outperforms standard ridge
regression and Gaussian process methods with preselected kernels.

Result: 实验表明，SFLI显著提升了初始ε-秩，加速收敛，缓解了谱偏置，并提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: SFLI方法简单高效，仅需在现有算法中添加一行代码即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks for scientific computing remains
computationally expensive due to the slow formation of diverse feature
representations in early training stages. Recent studies identify a staircase
phenomenon in training dynamics, where loss decreases are closely correlated
with increases in $\varepsilon$-rank, reflecting the effective number of
linearly independent neuron functions. Motivated by this observation, this work
proposes a structured first-layer initialization (SFLI) pre-training method to
enhance the diversity of neural features at initialization by constructing
$\varepsilon$-linearly independent neurons in the input layer. We present
systematic initialization schemes compatible with various activation functions
and integrate the strategy into multiple neural architectures, including
modified multi-layer perceptrons and physics-informed residual adaptive
networks. Extensive numerical experiments on function approximation and PDE
benchmarks, demonstrate that SFLI significantly improves the initial
$\varepsilon$-rank, accelerates convergence, mitigates spectral bias, and
enhances prediction accuracy. With the help of SILP, we only need to add one
line of code to conventional existing algorithms.

Abstract: In this work we propose and analyze a new Hybrid High-Order method for the
Brinkman problem for fluids with power-law viscosity. The proposed method
supports general meshes and arbitrary approximation orders and is robust in all
regimes, from pure (power-law) Stokes to pure Darcy. Robustness is reflected by
error estimates that distinguish the contributions from Stokes- and
Darcy-dominated elements as identified by an appropriate dimensionless number,
and that additionally account for pre-asymptotic orders of convergence.
Theoretical results are illustrated by a complete panel of numerical
experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized finite element method for solving
second-order elliptic partial differential equations with rough coefficients.
The method uses local approximation spaces computed by solving eigenvalue
problems on rings around the boundary of local subdomains. Compared to the
corresponding method that solves eigenvalue problems on the whole subdomains,
the problem size and the bandwidth of the resulting system matrices are
substantially reduced, resulting in faster spectral computations. We prove a
nearly exponential a priori decay result for the local approximation errors of
the proposed method, which implies the nearly exponential decay of the overall
approximation error of the method. The proposed method can also be used as a
preconditioner, and only a slight adaptation of our theory is necessary to
prove the optimal convergence of the preconditioned iteration. Numerical
experiments are presented to support the effectiveness of the proposed method
and to investigate its coefficient robustness.

Motivation: 解决离散不适定问题时，传统方法如非迭代Golub-Kahan-Tikhonov和Arnoldi方法在矩阵非对称时精度不足。

Method: 从无限维Hilbert空间出发，离散化问题后应用迭代Golub-Kahan-Tikhonov方法，并引入新的正则化参数选择策略。

Result: 改进方法比传统非迭代Golub-Kahan-Tikhonov和迭代Arnoldi-Tikhonov方法产生更精确的解。

Conclusion: 迭代Golub-Kahan-Tikhonov方法结合新正则化参数选择策略，显著提高了离散不适定问题的求解精度。

Abstract: The Golub-Kahan-Tikhonov method is a popular solution technique for large
linear discrete ill-posed problems. This method first applies partial
Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization to reduce the size of the given problem and then
uses Tikhonov regularization to compute a meaningful approximate solution of
the reduced problem. It is well known that iterated variants of this method
often yield approximate solutions of higher quality than the standard
non-iterated method. Moreover, it produces more accurate computed solutions
than the Arnoldi method when the matrix that defines the linear discrete
ill-posed problem is far from symmetric.
  This paper starts with an ill-posed operator equation in infinite-dimensional
Hilbert space, discretizes the equation, and then applies the iterated
Golub-Kahan-Tikhonov method to the solution of the latter problem. An error
analysis that addresses all discretization and approximation errors is
provided. Additionally, a new approach for choosing the regularization
parameter is described. This solution scheme produces more accurate approximate
solutions than the standard (non-iterated) Golub-Kahan-Tikhonov method and the
iterated Arnoldi-Tikhonov method.

Abstract: We propose a locally conservative enriched Galerkin scheme that respects the
discrete maximum principle of an elliptic problem. To this end, we use a
substantial over-penalization of the discrete solution's jumps to obtain
optimal convergence. To avoid the ill-conditioning issues that arise in
over-penalized schemes, we introduce an involved splitting approach that
separates the system of equations for the discontinuous solution part from the
system of equations for the continuous solution part, yielding well-behaved
subproblems. We prove the existence of discrete solutions and optimal error
estimates, which are validated numerically.

Abstract: The Sinc convolution is an approximate formula for indefinite convolutions
proposed by F. Stenger. The formula was derived based on the Sinc indefinite
integration formula combined with the single-exponential transformation.
Although its efficiency has been confirmed in variety of areas, there remain
some open problems in its theory. The first contribution of this study is to
resolve those problems by refinement of the theory of the Sinc convolution.
This contribution includes a partial resolution of Stenger's conjecture. The
second contribution of this study is to improve the convergence rate by
replacement of the single-exponential transformation with the
double-exponential transformation. In both theoretical and numerical ways, this
study also shows that the convergence rate of the new formula is improved
compared to Stenger's formula.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法对多样化视频类型（尤其是HDR内容）泛化能力不足，需开发更有效的评估框架。

Method: FR模型使用Swin Transformer提取深度结构和纹理相似性；NR模型利用SigLip 2提取全局特征。通过预训练和混合数据集训练策略优化模型。

Result: 模型在实验中表现优异，CompressedVQA-HDR-FR在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中获FR赛道第一名。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: 研究为临床应用中数据变异性、病变模糊性和协议差异提供了解决方案，并公开了代码和模型以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and
models will be publicly accessible and ready to use at

### [166] [Recurrent U-Net-Based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN) for Accurate Deformation Predictions in Sheet Material Forming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11547)
*Yingxue Zhao,Qianyi Chen,Haoran Li,Haosu Zhou,Hamid Reza Attar,Tobias Pfaff,Tailin Wu,Nan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RUGNN的图神经网络替代模型，用于预测材料成形过程中的变形场，解决了传统AI模型在捕捉3D空间关系和置换不变性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于标量或图像的AI替代模型难以捕捉复杂的3D空间关系和置换不变性，因此需要开发更高效的图神经网络模型。

Method: 开发了RUGNN模型，结合门控循环单元（GRUs）处理时序动态，以及受U-Net启发的图上下采样机制处理空间长程依赖。提出了一种新的‘节点到表面’接触表示方法。

Result: RUGNN在冷成形和热成形案例中表现出色，预测结果与真实有限元模拟高度一致，且优于其他基线GNN架构。

Conclusion: RUGNN是一种可靠的方法，能够支持板材成形设计，提供准确的制造性预测。

Abstract: In recent years, various artificial intelligence-based surrogate models have
been proposed to provide rapid manufacturability predictions of material
forming processes. However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically
built with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability
to capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a
permutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based
surrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study
developed a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U
Net-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate
predictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming
timesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model
temporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample
mechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'
contact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements
in computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN
model was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot
forming case study using aluminium alloys. Results demonstrate that the RUGNN
model provides accurate deformation predictions closely matching ground truth
FE simulations and outperforming several baseline GNN architectures. Model
tuning was also performed to identify suitable hyperparameters, training
strategies, and input feature representations. These results demonstrate that
RUGNN is a reliable approach to support sheet material forming design by
enabling accurate manufacturability predictions.

TL;DR: 论文开发了SurgeryLSTM模型，用于预测脊柱手术住院时长（LOS），结合时间建模和可解释性，性能优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LOS预测的准确性和可解释性，以支持临床决策和医院规划。

Method: 比较传统ML模型与SurgeryLSTM（带注意力的BiLSTM），使用EHR数据评估性能。

Result: SurgeryLSTM表现最佳（R2=0.86），注意力机制提高了可解释性，关键预测因素包括骨病和慢性肾病。

Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM为LOS预测提供高效且可解释的解决方案，支持临床决策系统集成。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for
predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the
benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and
Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random
forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,
SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an
attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.
Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key
predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved
the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)
and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by
dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative
clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most
contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone
disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most
impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention
mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential
nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher
accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical
adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based
temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM
presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in
elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal,
explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance
discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

TL;DR: CMCO框架通过结合蒙特卡洛dropout和分形预测，为神经算子提供无需重新训练或定制损失设计的分布无关预测区间，实现高效不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在实时虚拟传感中因稀疏、噪声或非共位传感器数据导致的不确定性量化难题，特别是在高风险领域。

Method: 提出Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO)，将蒙特卡洛dropout与分形预测结合于DeepONet架构中，实现空间解析的不确定性估计。

Result: 在湍流、弹塑性变形和全球宇宙辐射剂量估计等应用中，CMCO始终实现接近名义覆盖率的性能。

Conclusion: CMCO为神经算子提供了一种通用、即插即用的不确定性量化解决方案，为科学机器学习奠定了可扩展、泛化性强且不确定性感知的新基础。

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe
deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in
high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the
norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework
that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated,
distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with
split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves
spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or
custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow
operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains.
Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow,
elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO
consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with
strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a
general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking
real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and
safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal
computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable,
generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to
compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity
simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the
\emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein
Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic
differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed
distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural
Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime
geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics
emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential,
including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage
efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges
across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open
source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive
approaches to numerical relativity. Code is made available at

comprehensive and focused review of recent advances in synthetic tabular data
generation, emphasizing methods that preserve complex feature relationships,

and evaluation strategies. Therefore, this review prioritizes the actionable
goals that drive synthetic data creation, including conditional generation and
risk-sensitive modeling. Additionally, the survey proposes a benchmark
framework to align technical innovation with real-world demands. By bridging

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular
time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality.
They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational
social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and
seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant
challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena
using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional
tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders
that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings
support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection,
similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised
classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray
astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and
spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our
framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing
complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: As deep generative models proliferate across the AI landscape, industrial
practitioners still face critical yet unanswered questions about which deep
generative models best suit complex manufacturing design tasks. This work
addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models
(Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal
Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and
Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our
evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation
of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation
(reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii)
dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific
dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle
conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware
reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring
additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically
calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence,
component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall
performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal
variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics,
and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM
generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.

Method: 通过Dropout鲁棒性曲线（DRC）、测试准确率的方差、神经元激活比例和嵌入分布等指标分析模型行为。

Result: 发现Dropout鲁棒性、神经元稀疏性和嵌入分布与“顿悟”行为相关，并揭示了其与数据集对称性的联系。

Conclusion: 提出的指标能有效预测“顿悟”行为，并为理解其起源提供了新视角。

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test
accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in
training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including
variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity
measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of
neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout
Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the
dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The
variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training
checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally,
the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the
embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that
correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries.
These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and
behaviour of grokking.

Conclusion: 提出的协议在保护隐私的同时实现了可验证的联邦学习评估，适用于简单CNN和MLP模型。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data without exposing raw data. However, the evaluation phase in FL may leak
sensitive information through shared performance metrics. In this paper, we
propose a novel protocol that incorporates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to
enable privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation for FL. Instead of
revealing raw loss values, clients generate a succinct proof asserting that
their local loss is below a predefined threshold. Our approach is implemented
without reliance on external APIs, using self-contained modules for federated
learning simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experimental evaluation on both
the MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets. We focus on a
threshold-based proof for a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
(for MNIST) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (for HAR), and evaluate
the approach in terms of computational overhead, communication cost, and
verifiability.

Result: 模型能够匹配模拟和空间转录组数据的连续轨迹，捕捉细胞间和细胞内的相互作用。

Conclusion: STAGED提供了一种自适应且准确的方法来建模细胞动态，填补了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: The advent of single-cell technology has significantly improved our
understanding of cellular states and subpopulations in various tissues under
normal and diseased conditions by employing data-driven approaches such as
clustering and trajectory inference. However, these methods consider cells as
independent data points of population distributions. With spatial
transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic
cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key
computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such
complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM)
provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules
derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address
this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED)
integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and
its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE
networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents
genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning
their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match
continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from
spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and
intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate
representation of cellular dynamics.

Result: 提出的转子基线性层仅需O(log^2 d)参数，性能与块Hadamard和低秩近似等基线相当。

Conclusion: 研究为理解几何原语在深度模型中的组合提供了代数视角。

Abstract: Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of
low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but
these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this
compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize
linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using
Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions
of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a
differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This
construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense
matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention
layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such
as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an
algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into
higher-level functions within deep models.

Result: 嵌入表征方法比学习动态方法更不易加剧偏差，但难样本优先策略不一定提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 核心集选择方法需谨慎设计，以减少偏差并确保模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data
size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning.
However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn
spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand
whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate
these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the
implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected
coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an
extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations
benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,
and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.
Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between
sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant
model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using
embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk
of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based
on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some
coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing
difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail
industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions
are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being
treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the
timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network
operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures.
However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable
limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to
devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and
the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable
insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth
leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data
demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of
leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which
improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for
the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the
improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

Abstract: We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs
(PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the
numerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead
observes preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices
being compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the
reward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a
regret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we
present a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ for
episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per
episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is
the number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret
lower bound of $\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda
scores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that
achieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global
optimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all
occupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from
suboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and
computational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization
algorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the
unknown-transition setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RiemannLoRA的新方法，通过将LoRA矩阵视为光滑流形上的元素，解决了低秩矩阵分解中的过参数化和初始化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中广泛应用，但仍面临初始化策略和过参数化的挑战。

Method: 将固定秩的LoRA矩阵视为光滑流形，利用流形优化确定初始化方向，并结合数值线性代数和黎曼优化实现高效计算。

Result: 在LLM和扩散模型上的实验表明，RiemannLoRA在收敛速度和最终性能上优于标准LoRA及其先进改进。

Conclusion: RiemannLoRA通过流形优化框架有效解决了LoRA的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly
reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,
including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating
overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose
a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a
unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a
smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes
overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss
decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to
obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our
method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian
optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures
demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and
final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

TL;DR: FLEX是一个图生成模型框架，通过结构条件生成和对抗训练提升图神经网络在分布外场景下的链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在链接预测任务中表现优异，但依赖于同分布数据；图生成模型虽能生成新图，但应用受限。FLEX旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FLEX结合结构条件图生成和对抗训练（自动编码器与图神经网络协同训练），确保结构对齐以提升分布外性能。

Result: 实验表明FLEX在合成和真实分布外场景中显著提升性能，并分析了图数据增强对链接结构的影响。

Conclusion: FLEX无需专家知识即可适应不同分布外场景，为图生成模型的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link
prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples
being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models
(GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this,
GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge
this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1)
structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training
between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment
between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert
knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are
conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's
performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the
effects of graph data augmentation on link structures. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统局部预测模型在泛化性、过拟合、数据漂移和冷启动问题上的不足，探索全局模型在负载预测中的潜力。

Method: 研究特征转换和目标转换模型，提出基于时间序列聚类（TSC）的方法，并通过实验验证。

Result: 全局目标转换模型表现优于局部模型，而特征转换模型需依赖TSC处理数据异质性。

Conclusion: 全局模型在负载预测中具有优势，目标转换模型尤其有效，但需结合聚类技术优化特征转换模型。

Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various
hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of
delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local
forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in
handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.
These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally
expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In
contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance
prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through
globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load
forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of
different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore
feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how
globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In
addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its
potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the
balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series
clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming
models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.
Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity
load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently
outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global
features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming
models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring
TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的性能受限于随机或低信息初始特征表示，导致收敛慢和次优解。

Method: 使用GEE生成高质量初始节点特征，结合GNN形成GG框架，并进一步提出GG-C变体用于节点分类。

Result: 在节点聚类任务中，GG在所有评估数据集上表现最佳，收敛更快；GG-C在节点分类中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结构感知的特征初始化对发挥GNN潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide
range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often
constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature
representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions.
In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph
encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that
enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework
as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and
supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world
datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For
node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which
concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines.
These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature
initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将Conformal Prediction与Ensemble-SINDy（E-SINDy）结合的方法，用于量化SINDy模型的不确定性，并在时间序列预测、模型选择和系数不确定性方面展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化SINDy模型的不确定性对于评估其可靠性至关重要，尤其是在安全关键应用中。

Method: 通过将Conformal Prediction框架与E-SINDy结合，提出了三种应用：时间序列预测的不确定性量化、基于特征重要性的模型选择以及模型系数的不确定性量化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在时间序列预测中能可靠地达到目标覆盖率，有效量化特征重要性，并在非高斯噪声下为模型系数生成更稳健的不确定性区间。

Conclusion: Conformal Prediction与E-SINDy的结合能够显著提升模型的不确定性量化能力，适用于复杂动态系统。

Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for
discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying
uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability,
particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty
quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble
approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a
framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees
based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three
applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1)
quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on
library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified
model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three
applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical
systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can
reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting,
effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty
intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to
standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的机器学习方法在药物-靶点相互作用（DTI）预测中难以有效整合药物、靶点及其相互作用的多样化特征。

Method: 引入GiG模型，将药物和靶点的分子结构图表示为药物-靶点相互作用图中的元节点，结合转导学习和归纳学习，探索其复杂关系。

Result: GiG模型在多个评估指标上显著优于现有方法，证明了整合不同学习范式和相互作用数据的优势。

Conclusion: GiG框架为DTI预测提供了一种高效的方法，展示了多特征整合和多学习范式结合的重要性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for
advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine
learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have
difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets
and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel
framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and
inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target
interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a
GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and
target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph,
enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate
the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug
SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in
its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model
significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics,
highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and
interaction data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现中，生成稳定的分子构象对估计分子与靶标的结合亲和力至关重要。传统方法如分子动力学效率较低，而生成式机器学习方法更具潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展至更大分子系统、零样本泛化至新分子及生成局部结构提供了潜力。

Abstract: Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug
discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule
to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a
promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of
conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce
Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample
conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,
using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular
graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples
rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is
able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann
distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for
zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD
simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for
scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot
generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local
structure into the GFlowNet model.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了对比激活添加（CAA）在不同规模的Llama 2模型（7B、13B、70B）中的有效性，发现CAA在早期至中层最有效，且效果随模型规模增大而减弱，负向调控比正向调控效果更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）能力的提升，较少广泛部署的对齐技术效果尚不明确，因此研究CAA在不同规模模型中的表现。

Method: 通过对比对（如仇恨到爱）在模型的残差流向量空间中寻找理想方向，并在前向传播时添加该方向，直接操控残差流以提取特征控制输出。

Result: 1) CAA在早期至中层最有效；2) CAA效果随模型规模增大而减弱；3) 负向调控比正向调控效果更显著。

Conclusion: CAA的效果受模型规模和调控方向影响，为LLM对齐技术提供了新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the
efficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building
on previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition
(CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the
family of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable
'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive
pairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual
stream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and
aims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs.
Using answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found
that 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The
effectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more
pronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.

Motivation: 荷兰铁路网络是全球最繁忙的之一，延误问题突出，现有研究多关注短期预测，忽视了网络范围的模式。

Conclusion: 研究为交通网络评估提供了新见解，并提出了未来开发更稳健预测模型的方向。

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays
being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This
research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway
network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological
features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and
neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple
effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,
originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air
network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node
Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,
DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is
to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited
performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the
necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research
contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and
proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for
delays.

Conclusion: FlatVI通过优化潜在流形的几何特性，显著提升了单细胞数据建模的性能，适用于需要欧几里得几何假设的下游分析。

Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep
generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA
sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent
space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear
shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear
interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the
data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data
representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that
regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders
towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell
count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate
geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances
compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry.
Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our
approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data
demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

Result: 在合成和真实噪声的基准数据集上，CLID-MU优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLID-MU无需干净标签数据集，通过跨层信息差异有效处理噪声标签问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural
networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by
using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this
approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset,
which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the
challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean
labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the
need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively
preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and
the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the
Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU).
CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature
spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training.
Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both
synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at

Abstract: Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major
challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have
demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D
molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based
conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable
Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph
diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen
samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical
reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a
dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M
conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional
small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers
competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand
generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a
foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular
generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure
conditioning.

Conclusion: MNIST-Gen为特定任务提供高效的数据集生成工具，具有模块化和可扩展性。

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST,
FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited
to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on
domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other
real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant.
Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming,
legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present
MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating
MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using
hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic
understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve
intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical
approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics,
enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes:
individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large
datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category
theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable
morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of
concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and
\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing
task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization
accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

Conclusion: HyperEvent在准确性和效率上显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模图。

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction in continuous-time dynamic graphs is a fundamental
task for modeling evolving complex systems. Existing node-centric and
event-centric methods focus on individual interactions or atomic states,
failing to capture the structural cohesion of composite hyper-events, groups of
causally related events. To address this, we propose HyperEvent, a framework
reframing dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition. Central to
HyperEvent is the dynamic construction of an association sequence using event
correlation vectors. These vectors quantify pairwise dependencies between the
query event and relevant historical events, thereby characterizing the
structural cohesion of a potential hyper-event. The framework predicts the
occurrence of the query event by evaluating whether it collectively forms a
valid hyper-event with these historical events. Notably, HyperEvent outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on 4 out of 5 datasets in the official leaderboard.
For scalability, we further introduce an efficient parallel training algorithm
that segments large event streams to enable concurrent training. Experiments
validate HyperEvent's superior accuracy and efficiency on large-scale graphs.
Among which HyperEvent achieves a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank
over state-of-the-art baseline on the large-scale Flight dataset while
utilizing only 10.17% of the training time.

Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and
other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and
inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address
the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making
several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step
ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion
module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a
subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions
to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural
pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is
trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing
time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and
optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This
streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a
two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process,
Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop.
Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity
predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes
Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources
are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual
multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by
incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of
reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely
applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces
significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical
efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either
incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising
statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we
propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret
bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of
our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD)
estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion
of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator,
even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to
maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient
optimistic method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设特征顺序固定，无法区分特征值和位置对预测的影响，限制了模型解释的准确性。

Result: 在健康、自然语言和合成数据集上的实验表明，OrdShap能有效捕捉特征值和位置的影响，提供更深入的模型行为洞察。

Conclusion: OrdShap为位置敏感的特征归因提供了理论支持，提升了模型解释的准确性。

Abstract: Sequential deep learning models excel in domains with temporal or sequential
dependencies, but their complexity necessitates post-hoc feature attribution
methods for understanding their predictions. While existing techniques quantify
feature importance, they inherently assume fixed feature ordering - conflating
the effects of (1) feature values and (2) their positions within input
sequences. To address this gap, we introduce OrdShap, a novel attribution
method that disentangles these effects by quantifying how a model's predictions
change in response to permuting feature position. We establish a game-theoretic
connection between OrdShap and Sanchez-Berganti\~nos values, providing a
theoretically grounded approach to position-sensitive attribution. Empirical
results from health, natural language, and synthetic datasets highlight
OrdShap's effectiveness in capturing feature value and feature position
attributions, and provide deeper insight into model behavior.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of platform integration has emerged as an effective
solution to mitigate market fragmentation by consolidating multiple
ride-hailing platforms into a single application. To address heterogeneous
passenger preferences, third-party integrators provide Discount Express service
delivered by express drivers at lower trip fares. For the individual platform,
encouraging broader participation of drivers in Discount Express services has
the potential to expand the accessible demand pool and improve matching
efficiency, but often at the cost of reduced profit margins. This study aims to
dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express from the perspective
of individual platforms. The lack of historical data under the new business
model necessitates online learning. However, early-stage exploration through
trial and error can be costly in practice, highlighting the need for reliable
early-stage performance in real-world deployment. To address these challenges,
this study formulates the decision regarding the proportion of drivers'
acceptance behavior as a continuous control task. In response to the high
stochasticity, the opaque matching mechanisms employed by third-party
integrator, and the limited availability of historical data, we propose a
policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The
proposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance
during the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term
memory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and
adopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning
efficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate
the effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces
early-stage training losses.

Abstract: Imbalanced problems are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and are
extensively explored in classification tasks. However, they also present
challenges for regression tasks due to the rarity of certain target values. A
common alternative is to employ balancing algorithms in preprocessing to
address dataset imbalance. However, due to the variety of resampling methods
and learning models, determining the optimal solution requires testing many
combinations. Furthermore, the learning model, dataset, and evaluation metric
affect the best strategies. This work proposes the Meta-learning for Imbalanced
Regression (Meta-IR) framework, which diverges from existing literature by
training meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline composed of the
resampling strategy and learning model per task in a zero-shot fashion. The
meta-classifiers are trained using a set of meta-features to learn how to map
the meta-features to the classes indicating the best pipeline. We propose two
formulations: Independent and Chained. Independent trains the meta-classifiers
to separately indicate the best learning algorithm and resampling strategy.
Chained involves a sequential procedure where the output of one meta-classifier
is used as input for another to model intrinsic relationship factors. The
Chained scenario showed superior performance, suggesting a relationship between
the learning algorithm and the resampling strategy per task. Compared with
AutoML frameworks, Meta-IR obtained better results. Moreover, compared with
baselines of six learning algorithms and six resampling algorithms plus no
resampling, totaling 42 (6 X 7) configurations, Meta-IR outperformed all of
them. The code, data, and further information of the experiments can be found

Abstract: Imbalanced problems can arise in different real-world situations, and to
address this, certain strategies in the form of resampling or balancing
algorithms are proposed. This issue has largely been studied in the context of
classification, and yet, the same problem features in regression tasks, where
target values are continuous. This work presents an extensive experimental
study comprising various balancing and predictive models, and wich uses metrics
to capture important elements for the user and to evaluate the predictive model
in an imbalanced regression data context. It also proposes a taxonomy for
imbalanced regression approaches based on three crucial criteria: regression
model, learning process, and evaluation metrics. The study offers new insights
into the use of such strategies, highlighting the advantages they bring to each
model's learning process, and indicating directions for further studies. The

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实证科学和机器学习中普遍存在的可复现性问题促使了对可复现学习算法的研究。当前在批量设置下已有较好理解，但在控制设置（如强化学习）中仍存在显著差距。

Method: 提出了一种可复现的强化学习算法，在低水平表格MDP中实现了样本效率的提升。

Result: 算法在生成和情景设置下分别实现了$	ilde{O}(S^2A)$和$	ilde{O}(S^2A)$的样本复杂度，并提供了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 探索并非可复现学习的显著障碍，算法在状态空间$S$方面接近最优。

Abstract: The epidemic failure of replicability across empirical science and machine
learning has recently motivated the formal study of replicable learning
algorithms [Impagliazzo et al. (2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from
a fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the
design of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood.
In contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control
settings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with
a shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative
model of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch
setting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only
$\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a
generative model jumps to $\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the
substantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key
question in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration
inherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable
RL even possible?
  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular
MDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our
main result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging
the gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a
matching $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under
the common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in
the episodic setting of $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of
our algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-accelerated optimization framework for
RF power amplifier design that reduces simulation requirements by 65% while
maintaining $\pm0.3$ to $\pm0.4$ dBm accuracy. The proposed method combines
MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling with CatBoost gradient boosting to
intelligently explore multidimensional parameter spaces. Instead of
exhaustively simulating all parameter combinations to achieve target P2dB
compression specifications, our approach strategically selects approximately
35% of critical simulation points. The framework processes ADS netlists,
executes harmonic balance simulations on the reduced dataset, and trains a
CatBoost model to predict P2dB performance across the entire design space.
Validation across 15 PA operating modes yields an average $R^2$ of 0.901, with
the system ranking parameter combinations by their likelihood of meeting target
specifications. The integrated solution delivers 58.24% to 77.78% reduction in
simulation time through automated GUI-based workflows, enabling rapid design
iterations without compromising accuracy standards required for production RF
circuits.

Conclusion: 多轮强化学习在CUDA内核优化中表现优异，尤其是串行细化比并行采样更有效。

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems'
efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve
performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable
rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply
Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of
this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that
addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as
learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns.
We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL
for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin
shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of
generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to
1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini
(0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found
scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In
particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of
improvement.

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used
but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased
computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have
successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their
application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate
simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to
RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our
networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the
RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions
for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The
stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote
convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little
to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered
permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,
sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture
of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of
the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with
the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are
automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network
compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)
and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned
considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm
that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher
performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within
multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use
preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal
fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual
information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful
capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant
challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with
graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM
\textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In
MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to
enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure
information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a
multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and
relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the
fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of
the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world
datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud
detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Abstract: Social interactions play a crucial role in shaping human behavior,

such as verbal conversation, non-verbal gestures, facial expressions, and body
language. In this work, we develop a novel computational approach to detect a
foundational aspect of human social interactions, in-person verbal
conversations, by leveraging audio and inertial data captured with a commodity
smartwatch in acoustically-challenging scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we
conducted a lab study with 11 participants and a semi-naturalistic study with
24 participants. We analyzed machine learning and deep learning models with 3
different fusion methods, showing the advantages of fusing audio and inertial
data to consider not only verbal cues but also non-verbal gestures in
conversations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive set of evaluations
across activities and sampling rates to demonstrate the benefits of multimodal
sensing in specific contexts. Overall, our framework achieved 82.0$\pm$3.0%
macro F1-score when detecting conversations in the lab and 77.2$\pm$1.8% in the

Result: 实验表明，DUSE在类别平衡和不平衡场景下均优于8种核心集选择基线方法，并展现出对未见模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUSE为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field
of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large
amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the
available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model
training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert
annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common
method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a
certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot
fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges,
we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven
Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring
function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an
active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection
baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE
exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

Method: 比较正则化平均与更复杂的方法在不同反馈粒度下的表现。

Result: 实证分析表明，五级反馈下复杂方法所需个体数量减半。

Conclusion: 反馈粒度越高，复杂方法优势越明显。

Abstract: Human feedback is increasingly used across diverse applications like training
AI models, developing recommender systems, and measuring public opinion -- with
granular feedback often being preferred over binary feedback for its greater
informativeness. While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's
distribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,
cost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to
approximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the
empirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As
we will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.
  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using
feedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback
granularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of
regularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more
sophisticated than regularized averaging.
  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this
pattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the
number of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By
contrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance
of regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for acquiring
knowledge from sequential tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Although many CL methods have been proposed to show impressive empirical
performance, the theoretical understanding of their generalization behavior
remains limited, particularly for replay-based approaches. In this paper, we
establish a unified theoretical framework for replay-based CL, deriving a
series of information-theoretic bounds that explicitly characterize how the
memory buffer interacts with the current task to affect generalization.
Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds reveal that utilizing the limited
exemplars of previous tasks alongside the current task data, rather than
exhaustive replay, facilitates improved generalization while effectively
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our prediction-based bounds
yield tighter and computationally tractable upper bounds of the generalization
gap through the use of low-dimensional variables. Our analysis is general and
broadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method.
Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our
derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL
settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为城市规划和交通优化提供了灵活、高效的未来移动流模拟工具。

Abstract: The mobility patterns of people in cities evolve alongside changes in land
use and population. This makes it crucial for urban planners to simulate and
analyze human mobility patterns for purposes such as transportation
optimization and sustainable urban development. Existing generative models
borrowed from machine learning rely heavily on historical trajectories and
often overlook evolving factors like changes in population density and land
use. Mechanistic approaches incorporate population density and facility
distribution but assume static scenarios, limiting their utility for future
projections where historical data for calibration is unavailable. This study
introduces a novel, data-driven approach for generating origin-destination
mobility flows tailored to simulated urban scenarios. Our method leverages
adaptive factors such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and it
utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend
historical data with these adaptive parameters. The approach facilitates rapid
mobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions
of interest, without requiring extensive calibration data or complex behavior
modeling. The promising performance of our approach is demonstrated by its
application to mobile phone data from Singapore, and by its comparison with
existing methods.

### [210] [Emergence of Quantised Representations Isolated to Anisotropic Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12070)
*George Bird*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Spotlight Resonance方法的新方法，用于确定表征对齐，发现网络原语的代数对称性是任务无关表征结构的强预测因子。通过改变激活函数的研究，揭示了离散表征的形成机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究功能形式选择如何无意中引入归纳偏差，导致任务无关的表征结构，特别是当代形式如何诱导连续结构的离散化（量化效应）。

Method: 使用新工具对自编码器模型进行消融研究，仅改变激活函数，分析离散和连续代数对称性对表征的影响。

Result: 发现离散代数置换等变对称性导致表征离散化，而连续代数正交等变对称性保持表征连续性。量化表征与重建误差增加相关。

Conclusion: 功能形式对表征的影响机制为解释性研究提供了新见解，支持离散表征形成的因果模型，并可能解释下游解释性现象。

Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology for determining representational
alignment, developed upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Using this,
it is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong
predictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this
new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and
arrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the
activation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise
when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic
permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a
continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings
corroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended
inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in
representations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of
otherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this
supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations
may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability
phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general
linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed
mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide
several insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary
results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with
a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures
that this collapse can be detrimental.

*Yiding Feng,Wei Tang*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量两个预测模型之间信息差距的框架，称为信息差距（informativeness gap），并证明了其泛化性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决决策者在多个可能校准错误的预测模型中选择更“有用”模型的问题。

Method: 引入信息差距的概念，并通过其对现有理论（如U-Calibration和Blackwell informativeness）的泛化性进行验证。同时提出了一种基于对偶特性的信息度量方法。

Result: 信息差距框架能够有效衡量模型的实用性，且该度量方法具有完备性、可靠性，并能高效估计。

Conclusion: 该框架为决策者在多模型选择中提供了理论支持，并扩展了现有信息比较的理论基础。

Abstract: In many applications, decision-makers must choose between multiple predictive
models that may all be miscalibrated. Which model (i.e., predictor) is more
"useful" in downstream decision tasks? To answer this, our first contribution
introduces the notion of the informativeness gap between any two predictors,
defined as the maximum normalized payoff advantage one predictor offers over
the other across all decision-making tasks. Our framework strictly generalizes
several existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration
Decision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its
calibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51,
Bla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated. Our
second contribution is a dual characterization of the informativeness gap,
which gives rise to a natural informativeness measure that can be viewed as a
relaxed variant of the earth mover's distance (EMD) between two prediction
distributions. We show that this measure satisfies natural desiderata: it is
complete and sound, and it can be estimated sample-efficiently in the
prediction-only access setting. Along the way, we also obtain novel
combinatorial structural results when applying this measure to perfectly
calibrated predictors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线设备的快速增长导致频谱稀缺问题加剧，动态频谱分配（DSA）成为解决方案，但传统ML方法因隐私和带宽限制难以应用。联邦学习（FL）提供了一种分布式替代方案。

Method: 采用半监督联邦学习方法结合能量检测，解决标记数据稀缺问题；提出基于疫苗接种启发的防御机制，对抗数据投毒攻击。

Result: 实验表明，FLSS在未标记数据集上接近完美准确率，并能抵御高比例恶意参与者的数据投毒攻击。

Conclusion: FLSS是一种有效的分布式频谱感知解决方案，解决了数据稀缺和安全问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Advancements in wireless and mobile technologies, including 5G advanced and
the envisioned 6G, are driving exponential growth in wireless devices. However,
this rapid expansion exacerbates spectrum scarcity, posing a critical
challenge. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)--which relies on sensing and
dynamically sharing spectrum--has emerged as an essential solution to address
this issue. While machine learning (ML) models hold significant potential for
improving spectrum sensing, their adoption in centralized ML-based DSA systems
is limited by privacy concerns, bandwidth constraints, and regulatory
challenges. To overcome these limitations, distributed ML-based approaches such
as Federated Learning (FL) offer promising alternatives. This work addresses
two key challenges in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS). First, the scarcity of
labeled data for training FL models in practical spectrum sensing scenarios is
tackled with a semi-supervised FL approach, combined with energy detection,
enabling model training on unlabeled datasets. Second, we examine the security
vulnerabilities of FLSS, focusing on the impact of data poisoning attacks. Our
analysis highlights the shortcomings of existing majority-based defenses in
countering such attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel
defense mechanism inspired by vaccination, which effectively mitigates data
poisoning attacks without relying on majority-based assumptions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our solutions,
demonstrating that FLSS can achieve near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets
and maintain Byzantine robustness against both targeted and untargeted data
poisoning attacks, even when a significant proportion of participants are
malicious.

Conclusion: FourCastNet 3 在计算效率、概率校准和光谱保真度方面表现优异，适用于气象预报和早期预警系统。

Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable,
geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting.
The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model
the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in
stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3
delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble
models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8
to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches,
FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains
realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these
advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture
tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on
1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-
and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical
numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a
single GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly
resolution in under 20 seconds. Its computational efficiency, medium-range
probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal
timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting
and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.

Conclusion: PRISM为资源受限的边缘环境提供了一种可扩展且实用的基础模型部署方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range
of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but
pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing
interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing
foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a
communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer
inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation
to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device
communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to
eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in
position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme
tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2
across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and
CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead
(up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation
(51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation.
This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation
models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: GMRF MCVAE特别适用于需要建模多组件一致性的实际应用。

Abstract: Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial
assemblies or multi-modal imaging, challenge current generative modeling
techniques. Existing Multi-component Variational AutoEncoders typically rely on
simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently
compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly
address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component
Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian
Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design
choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer
representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically,
our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula
dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships,
demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly
enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results
indicate that the GMRF MCVAE is especially suited for practical applications
demanding robust and realistic modeling of multi-component coherence

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer
sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from
text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We
address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information
related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving
as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach
involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to
make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to
erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the
projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its
orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the
embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves
state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on
classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear
classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

Conclusion: 该研究为3D环境感知通信提供了基础数据集和基准，推动了未来研究的发展。

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling
environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial
distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM
construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely
on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as
direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial
variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static
learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data
distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a
large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in
realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than
previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA,
forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than
prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet
with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce
RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D
convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware
scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based
on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate
that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich,
high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work
provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D
environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised classification is a fundamental machine learning problem.
Real-world data often contain imperfections, characterized by uncertainty and
imprecision, which are not well handled by traditional methods. Evidential
clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, addresses these challenges. This
paper explores the underexplored problem of explaining evidential clustering
results, which is crucial for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Our
analysis shows that, in the general case, representativity is a necessary and
sufficient condition for decision trees to serve as abductive explainers.
Building on the concept of representativity, we generalize this idea to
accommodate partial labeling through utility functions. These functions enable
the representation of "tolerable" mistakes, leading to the definition of
evidential mistakeness as explanation cost and the construction of explainers
tailored to evidential classifiers. Finally, we propose the Iterative
Evidential Mistake Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which provides interpretable
and cautious decision tree explanations for evidential clustering functions. We
validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world data. Taking into
account the decision-maker's preferences, we were able to provide an
explanation that was satisfactory up to 93% of the time.

Motivation: 解决全量化模型性能不足和硬件部署挑战，通过选择性量化优化模型。

Result: 在四种ONNX模型上测试，精度损失减少54.14%，模型大小减少72.9%。

Conclusion: TuneQn有效优化选择性量化，显著提升模型性能和部署效率。

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network
models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of
accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance
below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware
accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues,
quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but
selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose
TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of
ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and
multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX
models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics
like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best
model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings
across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility
effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model
candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the
fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the
original model.

Conclusion: 结论是PILM为线性PDEs问题提供了一种高效且可解析求解的方法，尤其在数学正则化下表现更佳。

Abstract: Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs),
and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary
conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding
the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as
physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by
minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained
significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we
investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear
combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an
analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and
verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with
uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain
rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces
elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical
regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian
perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The
PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward
and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度神经网络（DNNs）优化器的角色，指出其不仅影响收敛速度，还影响学习解的性质，呼吁社区关注优化器的设计。


<details>

Motivation: 早期对DNNs可行性的怀疑源于其非线性特性导致无法保证收敛到全局最优解。然而，实践证明DNNs在标准训练协议下表现良好，这导致社区倾向于将优化视为凸问题，忽视了优化器对解性质的影响。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁社区更深入地理解现有优化器的偏置，并设计具有明确目标的新优化器，而不仅仅是关注收敛速度。

Abstract: Due to the nonlinear nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one can not
guarantee convergence to a unique global minimum of the loss when using
optimizers relying only on local information, such as SGD. Indeed, this was a
primary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early
days of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed
this skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows
that sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit
well-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This
success has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model
for learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of
required iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We
argue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another
perspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the
optimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative
properties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will
encode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class
of models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of
encoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community
should aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as
aim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain
properties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their
convergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our
understanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we
converge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a
critical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping
model outcomes.

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet
crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics,
neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD)
have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise,
resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this
paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series
follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing
behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the
extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals.
Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures,
demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

Conclusion: 该方法灵活、可扩展，适用于不同非平稳核，无需重新设计优化过程。

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression
because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they
often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and
may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses
nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling
these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as
input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the
chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior
of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods
for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different
nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure.
Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily
modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on
several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and
log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated
with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only
nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover
the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于适配器的一步适应方法在多领域应用中的性能下降和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出RegCL框架，通过合并不同领域训练的适配模块参数，并利用权重优化指导合并过程。

Result: 实验证明RegCL在多领域下游任务中表现优异，保持参数效率且无需历史数据存储。

Conclusion: RegCL有效整合多领域知识，适用于动态场景，提升了SAM模型的扩展性。

Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in
specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step
adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for
specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.
This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.
To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual
learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge
integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model
merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the
parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on
different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which
minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the
domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge
while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant
regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.
Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual
learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its
effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the
data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in
streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with
the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be
replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach
performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing
number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in
practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue
of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a
novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main
components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge,
(2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model
(PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our
proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current
SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity
analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of
parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（如Deepseek-R1）在链式思维生成过程中易受安全威胁（如后门提示攻击），导致推理机制被破坏，安全性和任务性能同时下降。

Method: 提出Thought Purity（TP）防御范式，包含三个部分：安全优化的数据处理流程、强化学习增强的规则约束和自适应监控指标。

Result: TP是首个针对链式思维攻击（CoTA）的全面防御机制，显著提升了安全性与功能性的平衡。

Conclusion: TP为下一代AI架构的安全性与功能性提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g.,
Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large
Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains
a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like
backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning
mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this
vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously
degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To
address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought
Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to
malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves
this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data
processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3)
adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive
defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement
learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the
security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Conclusion: 该方法为拓扑深度学习提供了高效且表达能力强的表示，适用于分子分类和性质预测任务。

Abstract: Topological neural networks have emerged as powerful successors of graph
neural networks. However, they typically involve higher-order message passing,
which incurs significant computational expense. We circumvent this issue with a
novel topological framework that introduces a Laplacian operator on
combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels
that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information
and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration
into modern transformer-based architectures.
  Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can
distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly
outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency.
Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art
descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in
distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on
topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning
by providing expressive yet scalable representations, thereby opening up
exciting avenues for molecular classification and property prediction tasks.

Result: 样本复杂度降至O(SA log A)，并通过实验验证了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在样本复杂度上优于现有工作，适用于无限时域MDP。

Abstract: In this study, we derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds on the
asymptotic sample-complexity for RL within the infinite-horizon Markov Decision
Process (MDP) setting that are sharper than those in existing literature. The
premise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each
other, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when
learning the $\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of
'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\epsilon$-optimal
value of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the
$\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of
transitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity
have values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number
of samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs
constructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce
the sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \log A)$ timesteps,
where $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend
these results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a
PAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with
showing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against
prior work in an experimental setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能的快速发展引发了对可信赖性的担忧，尤其是可解释性和鲁棒性。传统树模型虽具可解释性，但计算成本高且易受设备变化和对抗攻击影响。

Method: 采用$MoS_2$闪存模拟CAM实现软边界，结合软树模型进行高效推理。

Result: 在WDBC数据集上达到96%准确率，MNIST数据集中设备阈值变化10%时仅下降0.6%，优于传统决策树的45.3%下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升AI可信赖性和效率的专用硬件设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns
regarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and
robustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in
interpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains
computationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence.
Previous efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable
memory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement
sharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which
leads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
This work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$
Flash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient
inference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference
experiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional
robustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays
achieve $96\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database,
while maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model
validated only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\%$ device
threshold variation, compared to a $45.3\%$ drop for traditional decision
trees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's
trustworthiness and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对验证器不完美性如何影响测试时扩展性能的理论理解，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析验证器的ROC曲线几何特性，比较Best-of-N（BoN）和拒绝采样（rejection sampling）的性能差异，并在GSM8K数据集上使用不同版本的Llama和Qwen进行实验验证。

Result: 拒绝采样在固定计算量下优于BoN，但在无限计算量下两者性能趋于一致，由ROC曲线在原点附近的斜率决定。

Conclusion: 验证器的ROC曲线几何特性是决定测试时扩展性能的关键因素，理论分析为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging
additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied
techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a
verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding
of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this
gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is
precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.
Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC
curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve
for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to
extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute
regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed
compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level
of accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our
theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different
versions of Llama and Qwen to generate and verify solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的应用中（如医疗），如何高效获取信息以进行预测是一个关键问题，需权衡信息价值与获取成本。

Method: 提出NOCTA方法，包括非参数（NOCTA-NP）和参数（NOCTA-P）两种互补估计器，用于动态获取特征。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上，NOCTA优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NOCTA能有效解决动态特征获取问题，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of
information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in
healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to
imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be
acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover,
temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over
time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is
important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff
Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at
inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition
cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,
and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based
on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric
method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).
Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both
NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts

computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures
generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our
approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the
computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by
iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence
akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require
load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in
training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These
results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the
design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TDA的新框架，将TMLE直接嵌入神经网络参数空间，解决了现有方法在因果推断中的偏差问题，并支持多参数目标。


<details>

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络在预测方面强大，但在因果参数（如处理效应或生存曲线）的推断上缺乏有效性。现有方法要么依赖不保证解决高效影响函数方程的“目标损失”，要么计算成本高昂。

Method: TDA通过将模型参数分区并冻结大部分参数，仅更新一小部分“目标”子集，沿目标梯度迭代更新，从而消除一阶偏差并生成有效的置信区间。

Result: 在IHDP数据集和模拟生存数据上，TDA减少了偏差并提高了覆盖率，优于标准神经网络估计器和现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: TDA为现代深度架构中的复杂多参数目标提供了一条直接、可扩展的严格因果推断路径。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack
valid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire
survival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and
Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,
existing neural implementations either rely on "targeted losses" that do not
guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally
expensive post-hoc "fluctuations" for multi-parameter settings. We propose
Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly
into the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone
architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but
a small "targeting" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting
gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the
gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in
estimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid
confidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal
estimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting
gradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits
classical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric
efficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment
effects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces
bias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators
and prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable
pathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for
complex multi-parameter targets.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its
open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which
malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model.
Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules
that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest
majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight
Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically
irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete
information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private
validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design
satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their
participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning
an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions
of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping
adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3
percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries.
This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which
collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light,
budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a
practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.

Abstract: In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications
of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box
functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive
stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack
guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation
costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that
adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is
grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition
functions, namely the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected
improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected
cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these
two acquisition functions. In experiments on synthetic and empirical tasks,
including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture size search, we
show that combining our stopping rule with the PBGI acquisition function
consistently matches or outperforms other acquisition-function--stopping-rule
pairs in terms of cost-adjusted simple regret, a metric capturing trade-offs
between solution quality and cumulative evaluation cost.

Abstract: Slurry transportation is always crucial for many industrial processes. This
study numerically investigates the settling behavior of multisize solid
particles in a non-newtonian slurry inside a semicircular open channel (flume).
The non-newtonian slurry is modelled using a three-dimensional (3D) unsteady
Eulerian-Eulerian (E-E) model coupled with the Hershel-Bulkley (HB) rheological
model. A detailed sensitivity analysis of drag models is performed to establish
the solid-fluid interaction in the slurry flow. The numerical model is
validated with the experimental data from the literature and shows a fair
agreement. The validated model is used to simulate the settling behavior of the
slurry in the flume. The mean particle diameter of the solid particles in the
slurry is in the range of 75-296 $\mu$m with a median diameter of 188 $\mu$m.
The effect of particle size distributions (PSDs), flume inclination, bubble
size and bubble volume fraction on the particle settling inside the flume is
investigated in the parametric study. The analysis of our results revealed that
the settling of solids is significantly affected by PSDs in the open channel
system. In particular, the increase in flume inclination progresses the
settling and dissipation of fine and coarse particles, respectively. Additional
simulations showed that the inception of bubbles influences the settling
velocity of solids, which changes the settling behavior of multisize solids
inside the flume. The presented study can be used as a valuable guideline for
the optimisation of intermediate exclusion of water from thickened slurry in
order to ensure the stability of tailing storage facility.

Abstract: Many species of fish, as well as biorobotic underwater vehicles, employ body
caudal fin propulsion, in which a wave-like body motion culminates in
high-amplitude caudal fin oscillations to generate thrust. This study uses high
fidelity simulations of a mackerel-inspired caudal fin swimmer across a wide
range of Reynolds and Strouhal numbers to analyze the relationship between
swimming kinematics and hydrodynamic forces. Central to this work is the
derivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin.
This vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model
forms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics.
Scaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and
swimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity
simulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and
experimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters
that critically influence hydrodynamic performance. The results provide a
mechanistic framework for understanding thrust generation, optimizing swimming
performance, and assessing the effects of scale and morphology in aquatic
locomotion of both fish and biorobotic underwater vehicles.

Conclusion: CNS为三维湍流研究提供了更可靠的基准解，揭示了DNS在数值噪声影响下的局限性。

Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering
disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by
Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of
numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that
turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very
sensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical
noise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic
systems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that
numerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence
on turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov
turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than
DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS
can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required
small level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible
throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In
physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out
by Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent
Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with
that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal
trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly
polluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has
huge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and
the energy cascade but also even in statistics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度、数据驱动的降阶框架，用于高瑞利数下二维Rayleigh-Bénard对流，通过非线性自编码器和神经ODE建模慢速和快速分支，显著提升了精度。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高瑞利数下的Rayleigh-Bénard对流表现出间歇性的大尺度环流反转，传统方法难以捕捉其复杂多尺度动态。

Method: 从直接数值模拟中提取POD模态，通过高斯滤波分解为慢速和快速分量，分别用非线性自编码器和神经ODE建模。

Result: 模型将状态空间从10^5维降至20维，准确重建了流动结构、雷诺应力、能量自相关等，反转统计与DNS结果一致。

Conclusion: 多尺度潜在模型能有效捕捉湍流中的复杂动态，相比单分支方法显著提升了精度。

Abstract: We present a multiscale, data-driven reduced-order framework for
two-dimensional Rayleigh Benard convection in a square cell at high Rayleigh
number, where the flow exhibits intermittent large-scale circulation reversals.
Starting from direct numerical simulations using Nek5000, we extract a set of
energy-ranked POD modes from the combined velocity and temperature fields. A
Gaussian filter decomposes the temporal coefficients into low-frequency (slow)
and high-frequency (fast) components, enabling a two-branch modeling strategy.
Each branch is mapped into a latent representation using a nonlinear
autoencoder and evolved via neural ODEs that incorporate time modulation. This
strategy reduces the system from an original state space dimension of 10^5 to a
compact 20-dimensional latent space while preserving the essential multiscale
dynamics. Our model achieves accurate reconstruction of instantaneous flow
structures, Reynolds stresses, energy autocorrelations and long-time
quantities, such as angular momentum and wall observables. Furthermore, a
waiting time analysis of flow reversals validates the statistical alignment of
model prediction and DNS results. The explicit modeling of separate slow and
fast branches yields significantly improved accuracy in both short-time flow
structures and long-time reversal statistics, compared to single-branch
alternatives. These results demonstrate the potential of multiscale latent
models for capturing complex dynamics in turbulent flows.

Result: 表面活性剂梯度显著改变波动力学，尤其在溢流破碎波中导致波峰演化、涡度生成及向俯冲行为的转变。

Conclusion: 表面活性剂主要通过Marangoni应力而非表面张力降低影响破碎波动态。

Abstract: We investigate the influence of insoluble surfactants on the spatio-temporal
evolution of breaking waves, focusing on both regular and spilling regimes.
Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are conducted using an
interface-tracking/level-set method that incorporates surfactant-induced
Marangoni stresses. The simulations reveal that surfactant gradients, through
Marangoni stresses, markedly alter the wave dynamics. While regular breakers
exhibit only minor modifications in the presence of surfactants, increasing
surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses in spilling breakers leads to pronounced
changes in the crest evolution, vorticity generation, and even a transition
towards plunging-like behavior. To quantify these effects, we also extend
circulation-based theoretical frameworks to account for surfactant
contributions. This work demonstrates the crucial role that surfactants play in
the dynamics of breaking waves, revealing that their impact is primarily driven
by Marangoni stresses rather than surface tension reduction.

Abstract: In this work, we used a coupled level set and volume of fluid (CLSVOF)
computational method for studying the generation of microdroplets in a two
dimensional circular co-flow microfluidic device. The fundamental understanding
of shear thinning behavior on controlled droplet formation in a microchannel is
systematically investigated. Droplet generation and dynamics are controlled by
altering the operating conditions and fluid properties, such as CMC solution
concentration, both fluids flow rates, and interfacial tension. The droplet
length, velocity, liquid film thickness, and formation frequency are
quantitatively analyzed and presented in a non-dimensional form. The droplet
length decreased with the flow rate and concentration of the CMC solution.
However, the length of the droplet increased with dispersed phase flow rate and
interfacial tension. From the set of simulation data, the flow regime maps and
scaling relations are developed over a range of operating conditions. This work
provides critical insights into the uniform and controlled droplet formation in
shear-thinning fluids within a circular co flow microchannel, offering guidance
for future innovations in the design and optimization of microfluidic systems
for specific applications.

Abstract: This study presents a three-dimensional transient computational fluid
dynamics simulation of droplet generation in a flow-focusing microfluidic
device using the Coupled Level Set and Volume of Fluid method for interface
capturing. We systematically investigated the effects of shear-thinning
non-Newtonian fluids, specifically carboxymethyl cellulose solutions, on the
generation of mineral oil droplets. The rheological properties of carboxymethyl
cellulose were analyzed at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%, with
the parameters K and n specified in terms of viscosity. The study examines the
influence of rheological properties, continuous and dispersed phase flow rates,
and interfacial tension forces on the generation and dynamics of controlled
high-throughput droplets. The numerical results provide insights into droplet
characteristics, including droplet length, velocity, formation frequency,
liquid film thickness, pressure distribution, and flow regimes. The findings
revealed that increasing the carboxymethyl cellulose concentration (0.1% to
1.0%) and continuous phase flow rate (10 {\mu}L/min to 30 {\mu}L/min) reduces
droplet length by 53% and 45%, respectively. while increasing the dispersed
phase flow rate (2 {\mu}L/min to 18 {\mu}L/min) and interfacial tension results
in increased droplet length by 62% and 42%. At lower concentrations of
carboxymethyl cellulose, plug-shaped droplets fully occupy the channel width in
the squeezing regime. As concentration increases, a transition to the dripping
and jetting regimes is observed. The study further explores non-dimensional
parameters, expressing the Weber and modified Capillary numbers as functions of
flow rate and interfacial tension. These insights impact drug delivery,
material synthesis, and microfluidic technologies requiring precise droplet
control.

Abstract: This work experimentally investigates deformable nitrogen bubbles rising in
ultrapure water and interacting with a vertical wall, focusing on how this
downstream boundary alters their dynamics, an effect critical to many
real-world processes. The experiments were conducted with a fixed Morton
number, $Mo = 2.64 \times 10^{-11}$, with Bond, Galilei, and Reynolds numbers
in the ranges $0.08 \lesssim Bo \lesssim 0.33$, $71 \lesssim Ga \lesssim 194$,
and $132 \lesssim Re \lesssim 565$, respectively. The initial dimensionless
horizontal distance between the wall and the bubble centroid was systematically
varied, $0.3 \lesssim L \lesssim 5$, and the bubble trajectories from two
orthogonal vertical planes were captured using high-speed imaging. While the
bubble rising paths were stable without the wall presence for all the cases,
the results reveal that wall proximity significantly affects the rising path,
depending on $Bo$ (or $Ga$) and $L$. A map with four distinct interaction
regimes and their transitions is obtained: (i) Rectilinear Path (RP) at low
$Bo$ and large $L$, with negligible wall influence; (ii) Migration Away (MA) at
higher $Bo$ and moderate-to-large $L$, with lateral deviation from the wall;
(iii) Collision and Migration Away (C+MA) at high $Bo$ and small $L$, where
bubbles first collide and then migrate away; and (iv) Periodic Collisions (PC)
at low $Bo$, where repeated wall impacts occur due to competing forces. These
findings bridge the gap between idealised simulations and practical systems,
offering high-quality data to support and refine computational models of
bubble-wall interactions in industrial and environmental applications.
