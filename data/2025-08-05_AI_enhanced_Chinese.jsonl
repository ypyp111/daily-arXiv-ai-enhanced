Yet, gas filaments produce the smallest bubble\nsizes, which drive gas dissolution, critical to ocean-atmosphere exchange such\nas carbon dioxide and oxygen, as well as marine aerosols emission, serving as\nnuclei for cloud condensation and ice particle production. Here, we unravel the\nfundamental physics governing the splitting of a single filament in a model\ngeometry by combining numerical simulations, laboratory experiments and theory.\nWe show that the splitting of a single filament generates a power-law bubble\nsize distribution following $d^{-3/2}$ with $d$ the volume equivalent bubble\ndiameter, suggesting the existence of a self-similar breakup mechanism, absent\nin liquid ligament fragmentation. We propose a deterministic model, based on\nthe capillary fragmentation of a filament with power-law shape, which\nquantitatively captures the bubble size distribution. We demonstrate that the\nfilament shape at breakup sets the size distribution of a first generation of\nbubbles. This distribution is then reproduced at smaller and smaller scales by\nlatter breakups in a self-similar manner. The $d^{-3/2}$-distribution coincides\nwith the size distribution of small bubbles observed in dilute turbulent flow,\nsuch as below breaking waves. We argue that the turbulent bubble size\ndistribution observed in nature arises as the superposition of many individual\nfilament splittings.

Under consideration at JFM", "summary": "We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of\nthe spreading of viscous droplets over rough and smooth substrates. First, we\nexperimentally investigate the wetting of a roughened glass surface by a\nviscous droplet of silicone oil, wide and shallow relative to the capillary\nlength $\\ell_c$. The radius of the droplet grows according to a\n$R_\\mathrm{drop}\\sim t^{1/8}$ scaling reminiscent of gravity currents (Lopez,\n1976; Voinov, 1999). The droplet is preceded by a mesoscopic fluid film that\npercolates through the rough substrate, its radius increasing according to\n$R_\\mathrm{film}\\sim t^{3/8}/(\\log t)^{1/2}$. To rationalize these observed\nscalings, we develop a new 'capillary current' model for the spreading of\nshallow droplets with arbitrary radius on both smooth and rough surfaces. We\npropose that, throughout their evolution, capillary currents maintain a\nquasi-equilibrium balance between hydrostatic and curvature pressure, perturbed\nonly by unbalanced contact line forces arising along the droplet's edge. In\naddition to rationalizing our experimental data, our model provides new\nrationale for a number of scalings reported in prior work. In particular, for\ndrops small with respect to $\\ell_c$, it recovers the classic spreading laws of\nTanner (1979) and Hoffman (1975); for drops wide with respect to $\\ell_c$, it\nreveals how millimetric, surface-tension-driven capillary currents exhibit the\nsame spreading behavior as relatively large-scale viscous gravity currents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7c98\u6027\u6db2\u6ef4\u5728\u7c97\u7cd9\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u57fa\u5e95\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6bdb\u7ec6\u7ba1\u7535\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7c98\u6027\u6db2\u6ef4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u5e95\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7c97\u7cd9\u8868\u9762\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7845\u6cb9\u6db2\u6ef4\u5728\u7c97\u7cd9\u73bb\u7483\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6bdb\u7ec6\u7ba1\u7535\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6db2\u6ef4\u534a\u5f84\u9075\u5faa$R_\\mathrm{drop}\\sim t^{1/8}$\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u800c\u6db2\u819c\u534a\u5f84\u9075\u5faa$R_\\mathrm{film}\\sim t^{3/8}/(\\log t)^{1/2}$\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6269\u6563\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6bdb\u7ec6\u7ba1\u7535\u6d41\u4e0e\u91cd\u529b\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002"}}

We examine how the thickness and fragmentation of such a\nradially expanding rim change upon its severance from its sheet, absent of\nliquid influx. To do so, we design an experiment enabling the study of rims pre\nand post severance by vaporizing the thin neck connecting the rim. We confirm\nthat the severed rim follows a ballistic motion, with a radial velocity\ninherited from the sheet at severance time. We identify that the severed rim\nundergoes fragmentation in two types of junctions: the base of inherited,\npre-severance, ligaments and the junction between nascent rim corrugations,\nwith no significant distinction between the two associated timescales. The\nnumber of ligaments and fragments formed is captured well by the theoretical\nprediction of rim corrugation and ligament wavenumbers established for unsteady\nexpanding sheets upon droplet impact on surfaces of comparable size to the\ndroplet, and with the sheet thickness profiles in both systems having the same\nfunctional form. Our findings are robust to changes in impacting laser energy\nand initial droplet size. Finally, we report and analyze the re-formation of\nthe rim on the expanding sheet and propose a prediction for its characteristic\ncorrugation timescale.

This\nis particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated\ntrials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.\nHowever, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire\nmodel selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We\nintroduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past\nexperiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines\nefficiently.

On four text classification and\ntwo question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak\nF1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error\nratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the\nzero-shot Pareto front.

The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing\nsingle-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address\ndifferent types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world\nqueries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost\nefficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an\nadaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent\norchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.\nSpecifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG\nmodules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and\ngeneration agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the\nappropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for\neach query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable\ncosts. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement\nlearning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based\npenalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a\nreasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate\nthat our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only\nachieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within\nacceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on\nhttps://github.com/chenyiqun/Agentic-RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RAG\u6846\u67b6MAO-ARAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fa\u5b9aRAG\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6267\u884c\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u6587\u6863\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMAO-ARAG\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAO-ARAG\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks.

Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type.

Results demonstrate that the approaches perform\nwell, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid\nmodels utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale\nvideos with real data are the easiest to predict.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0eRNN\u30013D CNN\u7b49\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cSSIM\u6307\u6807\u4ece0.69\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.82\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eRNN\u30013D CNN\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f3D CNN\u4e0eConvLSTM\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cSSIM\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.82\uff0c\u7070\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c3D CNN\u4e0eConvLSTM\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5c24\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

As Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive\nway that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated\nexperimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk\nof losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also\nthat these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple\ngains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the\ncontingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios.

Maintaining reliable\nconnectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite\nbeams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address\nchallenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can\nanalyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific\nlocations.

Recent works show that when\ntrained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward\nmodels in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained\nweights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.\nCurrent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training\nlargely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on\nraw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of\nevents. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training\nframework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is\nwell-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long\nevent sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling\nparadigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to\naccumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic\ninformation about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and\nreduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to\nreason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nstate-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Unlike\ntraditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct\ninputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature\nextraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts\nrelevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture\ncomplex relationships between signal types and fault patterns.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed model, achieving 92.5\\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\\% for\nbearing faults, and 93.1\\% for broken rotor bar detection.

Experimental results on ten\ndiverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced\nLLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all\nbaseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing\nenhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically\naligned attention patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCCRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LPWCA\u548cPAI\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LPWCA\u6355\u83b7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0cPAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a03.55M\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "CCRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u533a\u57df\u805a\u7126\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Experimental visualizations of the flow inside the device and\nmeasurements of the mixture density and liquid and vapor flow rates at the\nnozzle orifice are employed to validate the model and assess the sensitivity of\nnumerical results to modeling parameters. The results obtained for a standard\ndevice geometry show that the model is able to quantitatively predict several\naspects of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the metered discharge.

In response, we introduce WebDS, the first\nend-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data\nscience tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data\nportals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,\nmulti-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats\nthat better reflect the realities of modern data analytics.

One of their prominent applications\nin traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky\ndriving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows\nand static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -\nlimiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world\ndriving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across\ndifferent thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more\nvariability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which\nmay be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway\nemerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh\ndriving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual\nvariation.

The prevailing theory, a critical-layer resonance mechanism\nproposed by Miles (1957), has seen numerous refinements; yet, the role of\nLagrangian drift -- the velocity a fluid parcel actually experiences -- in wave\ngrowth was not understood. Our analysis first recovers the classic Miles growth\nrate from linear theory before extending it to third order in the wave slope to\nderive a modified growth rate. The leading-order wave-induced mean flow alters\nthe higher-order instability, manifesting as a suppression of growth with\nincreasing wave steepness for the realistic wind profiles considered. This\nresult is qualitatively consistent with observations. An integral momentum\nbudget suggests that the wave-induced current alters the coupling between the\ntotal phase speed and the total Lagrangian mean flow at the critical level (as\ndefined in the linear theory), thereby reducing the efficiency of momentum\ntransfer. Notably, this Lagrangian drift is precisely what Doppler-shift based\nremote sensing of upper ocean currents measure, providing a direct\nobservational pathway to account for this wave-induced feedback in studies of\nair-sea coupling.

Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits\ntheir applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across\nvarying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the\nhippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively\nreconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for\ntrajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by\nselectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two\ncomplementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent\nlearned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity\nto represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall\nknowledge by equiprobable sampling.

Code:\n  https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT", "summary": "In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient\nexecution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile\nmodels-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical\ntasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and\nmedical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical\nimaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing\nlightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we\npropose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)\ntailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly\npurposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a\nparameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This\ndesign exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being\nlighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we\nintroduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively\nbalances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of\nmedical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer\nbottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with\ndownsample skip connections for dense prediction.

It consists of\nthree subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or\nall modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER\nreveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on\naudio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual\nmodality.

However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive\ninformation, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world\nwhere data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification\n(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting\nunauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its\ndiversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely\nchallenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied\non oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of\nsecurity. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model\nfirst learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet\nidentifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an\nout-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging\nVision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most\ninformative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer\nset, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a\nbetter trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments\nacross diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach\nsimultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly\noutperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and\neffectiveness, with moderate computational overhead.

We consider the case in which the\nelastic interface is clamped at the lateral walls of a closed trough and thus\nencloses a finite amount of fluid. For a slender film undergoing infinitesimal\ndeformations, the displacement of the elastic surface from its initial\nequilibrium position obeys a sixth-order (in space) initial boundary value\nproblem (IBVP). To solve this IBVP, we construct a set of odd and even\neigenfunctions that intrinsically satisfy the boundary conditions (BCs) of the\noriginal IBVP. These eigenfunctions are the solutions of a non-self-adjoint\nsixth-order eigenvalue problem (EVP). To use the eigenfunctions for series\nexpansions, we also construct and solve the adjoint EVP, leading to another set\nof even and odd eigenfunctions, which are orthogonal to the original set\n(biorthogonal). The eigenvalues of the adjoint EVP are the same as those of the\noriginal EVP, and we find accurate asymptotic formulas for them. Next,\nemploying the biorthogonal sets of eigenfunctions, a Petrov--Galerkin spectral\nmethod for sixth-order problems is proposed, which can also handle lower-order\nterms in the IBVP. The proposed method is tested on two model sixth-order BVPs,\nwhich admit exact solutions. We explicitly derive all the necessary formulas\nfor expanding the quantities that appear in the model problems into the set(s)\nof eigenfunctions. For both model problems, we find that the approximate\nPetrov--Galerkin spectral solution is in excellent agreement with the exact\nsolution.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly.

Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image\ngeneration, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable\ndiagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary\nchallenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the\nstructural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram\ngeneration. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent\nsystem designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into\nstructured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic\nreasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and\nstructurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual\neffort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the\nSketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework\nencompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed\ngraphs, and model architectures.

On the other\nhand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a\ngiven sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with\nserious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study\nMIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models\n(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,\ntheir effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,\nwe propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art\nattack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five\nexisting MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k\noutperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR\nmetrics, especially on smaller models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIAs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3awin-k\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08min-k\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5win-k\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516b\u4e2aSLMs\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "win-k\u5728AUROC\u3001TPR @ 1% FPR\u548cFPR @ 99% TPR\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MIAs\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "win-k\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Project Page:\n  https://chaitanya100100.github.io/UniEgoMotion/", "summary": "Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is\ncrucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,\nadvancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by\naccurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.\nHowever, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with\nstructured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world\negocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and\ndynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nEgocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks\nthat utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without\nrelying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional\nmotion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored\nfor egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports\negocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person\nvisual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene\nsemantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer\nplausible 3D motion.

An NLP-Based Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nbeen a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take\nunstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI\nplanning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as\nplanners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated\nactions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during\nplan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the\nplans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and\nreliability of classical planners.

Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski\nand Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)\nderive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised\ncontinuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =\n\\alpha / (\\alpha + \\beta)$, where $\\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and\n$\\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full\nautomation is precluded whenever $\\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in\nthree complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an\nevolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task\nspectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is\nreproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation\ncalibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from\napproximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third\nof tasks to humans.

To\nvalidate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and\nrigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for\ntime-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal\n(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,\n2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't\nabout the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent\ncomplementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic\nfeature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, \"Complementary Feature\nDomains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning,\" presents a mathematically\nquantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating\nthat optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic\ninformation-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u90fd\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e09\u79cd\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff08Hybrid 1\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u800c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u52a0\u5165\uff08Hybrid 2\uff09\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u662f\u5426\u7ee7\u627f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3001\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba8\u8bba\u53ca\u590d\u5408\u538b\u529b\u573a\u666f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c6,500\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba8\u8bba\u548c\u590d\u5408\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Current research shows that using large language\nmodels (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields\nexcellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization.

We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework\nnamed \\textbf{IterChat}.

Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue\ndataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target\npreference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and\ntheir corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental\nresults indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new\ndialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn\ndialogues.

Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may\nyield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such\nscenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,\nwe introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which\nestimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes\nrather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states\nis not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to\ncrucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a\nGaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to\nphysically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional\ndynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our\nmethod and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical\nsystems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,\nwhich models the global weather at a 5.625{\\deg} meridional resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u673a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u7ef4WeatherBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire\nsufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,\nwe decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge\ncontent learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we\nconstruct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world\nwebsites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web\nagent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the \"nouns\" upon\nwhich comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason\nand act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through\na novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing\nand training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner.

Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information\nentropy $H = - \\sum {{p_i}\\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the\niterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and\nconfidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world\nresearch question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12\noptimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves\nby 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the\nframework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases\nsignificantly by 0.92.

Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations.

However, directly extending them to the video\ndomain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects\ntemporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group\nCaptioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning.

To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label\nPropagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP\nbranch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and\nfeature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.\nFollowed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the\ncontribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP\nbranch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few\nfeatures are available but also in abundantly available situations.

Specifically,\nthe local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their\ncorresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.\nAfterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident\ndisparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a\ndual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance\nat disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo\nbenchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728KITTI Stereo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u56e0\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u89c6\u5dee\u6807\u6ce8\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u6613\u53d7\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u5dee\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u51c6\u5bc6\u96c6\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u6df1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI Stereo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u75283D\u51e0\u4f55\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Then, to reconstruct data\ncorrectly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor\n(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories\nwhile discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.\nFinally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction\nwith Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a\nrepresentation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers\nprevious category information and returns category-adaptive\nrepresentation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of\n66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,\nrespectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aC3D-AD\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c7b\u70b9\u4e91\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165KAL\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\uff0cKAA\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cRPP\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747AUROC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a66.4%\u300183.1%\u548c63.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "C3D-AD\u5728\u591a\u7c7b3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002"}}

While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,\nlittle is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these\nfailures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk.

This influx of data presents opportunities\nfor cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts\nwhile also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope\nwith this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by\njointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their\noriginal data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability\ndifferences and educational context differences between different\ngroups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of\nmodels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware\nfederated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models\nbuilt upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,\npreserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students\non each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the\nstudents in each client based on its local student learning data, and each\nclient uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter\naggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The\nmain idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the\nfirst is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic\nfunction-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;\nthe second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,\ncontaining exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware\naggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness.

Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle\nin handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we\ninstead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view\nSemantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations.

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated\ntasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory\nleading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues.

Although existing sparse attention\nmechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as\nstatic patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head\nattention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native\nsparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.\nMoreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also\ndemonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.\nCrucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly\noutperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the\nchallenging needle-in-a-haystack task.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages.

Our\nanalysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative\nsamples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn\ndrives rapid performance gains.

Specifically, although linear\nattention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight\ndesign, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence\nmodeling.

Applying these\nmethods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static\nvehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed\ninstallations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,\nocclusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on\nspecialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these\nconditions.

The proposed license plate recognition pipeline\nfilters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several\nprompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a\nrevised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection\nmodule, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class\ndataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected\non the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of\n91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public\nUFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The\nself-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make\nand model recognition.

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation\nmodel with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through\nself-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with\nexpert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers\nthree significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot\ngeneralisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and\nout-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control\npolicies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is\nlightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling\nlarge-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC\nprocess and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its\nself-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,\noutperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In\npractice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,\nshortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size\nposes critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache\ncompression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads\nin Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different\nfunctionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens\nand thus degrades the performance of LLMs.\n  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in\nGQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first\nidentify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of\nretrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of\nretrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding\nsemantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important\ntokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs.

This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system\nthat uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a\nlarge language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration\nwith the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two\nsessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using\nApple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent\nstroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector\nClassifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,\nwere trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was\ndeveloped to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across\nfour participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely\nRandomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of\n0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully\nprovided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement\nnear the wrists improved data quality.

Rather than humans browsing and clicking,\nvision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and\ntransact.

Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top\nrow, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption\nof a universal \"top\" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward\nendorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally\nhuman-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios\nwhere sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a\nseller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI\nbuyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated\nshopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across\nmodels and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,\nraising competition questions.

To determine when and how to change\ngrouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period\nof the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation\nmechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to\nreduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct\nextensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,\nand our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and\nimproves model accuracy compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5DC-PFL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7ebf\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DC-PFL\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two\nprimary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve\nmultiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of\nmany utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to\ntheir omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a\nmulti-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves\nwith dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with\n43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation\nTheory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a\ncomprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as\nutterances that do not contain talk moves.

The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on\nmodel decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated\nscripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the\npriority of the \"Garbage-In, Garbage-Out\" problem that caused poor data inputs\nor incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates\ntwo external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality\ndata at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time\nevaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,\nidentify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External\nAgent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and\naccuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training\ncycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world\nscenario, which is \"Document Identification and Information Extraction\".

Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to condense information from\nsequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling\nPrivacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the\ntraining characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the\ncondensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the\nprivacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more\nrepresentative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align\nthe current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay\nsamples to match the style of the current domain.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal\nperformance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EAC-MoE\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3MoE-LLMs\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faQESC\u548cPESF\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "MoE-LLMs\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8GPU\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u4f4e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u6cd5\u7b49\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEAC-MoE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bQESC\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u6821\u51c6\uff09\u548cPESF\uff08\u526a\u679d\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "EAC-MoE\u4e3aMoE-LLMs\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The main bottleneck lies in the\nexpensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a\npromising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision\ninteger computations, significantly reducing overhead.

Multiple Instance Learning\n(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level\nprediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while\noverlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction\nstage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap\nand suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown\npromise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds\nupon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.\nThis inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and\ninterdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and\ndrastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a\nCascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an\naverage of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust\nslide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling\nstrategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both\nmodel-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a\nLocal-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution\nWSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global\ncontextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR\nis optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity.

To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end\nVElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit\ncontour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial\nlevel set function from image features and the point input, which then\nprogressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a\nshape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This\nnetwork learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling\ngeometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive\nexperiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA\noutperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a\nsingle-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric\nmodeling under weak guidance.

This task poses significant challenges due to\ncomplex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly\ndeformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single\nmodel to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse\namodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to\nadopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different\nshape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's\nunderlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and\ninsufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized\nexperts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific\nsparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to\nlearn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a\nlightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,\nShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures\nkey shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to\nthe most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert\nrouting. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting\noccluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well\ninterpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining\nhigh capacity and efficiency.

However, their application to semantic segmentation is\nhindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as\nsegmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM\npre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation\nscenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To\novercome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based\nsegmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited\ndata and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.\nSpecifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a\ndomain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of\nthe backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the\nRein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and\nlogit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic\ntransfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment\nanything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated\nRein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,\ndaytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,\nnighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with\nefficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and\nadaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of\nparameters.

A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual\npre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining\nfrom scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution\nshifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this\npaper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this\ndistribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay\nand gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the\nLlama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100\nbillion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and\ngradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting.

The latter, also known as region-based\ncorrespondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to\nenable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at\npixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two\nsteps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.\nIn this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly \"searching for\ncorresponding prompts\", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models\n(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we\nintroduce the \"corresponding prompt problem\", which aims to identify a\ncorresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,\nsuch that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of\ncorresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an \"inverse\nprompt\" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,\ninverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y.

Recent advances move beyond\ndiscrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward\ncontinuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential\nEquations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the\nunderlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,\nextrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the\ndynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably\nunder distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as\nthe continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics\nsolely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories\ntoward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To\nachieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and\n(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain\nrich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to\nprocess past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to\nextract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.\nDuring training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future\ntrajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal\ncurrent action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon\noptimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,\nindicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable\nperformance.

However, autonomously\nbuilding computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the\ncomplexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the\nneed for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we\nintroduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework\nthat transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly\ninto optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given\nonly raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge\noutputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training\nvirtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:\nTask Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature\nretrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop\noptimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated\ngeneration of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts\nwith differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to\ncollaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.\nWe demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,\nusing six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and\ncytokine stimulations across multiple modalities.

However, current RLVR methods\ntypically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.\nMethods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often\nyield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other\nhand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments\nfor each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision\nlabels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning\n(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method\nCredit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response\nrollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,\ngeneral-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to\ngenerate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable\ntoken-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned\nidentical rule-based rewards.

We propose three tasks to benchmark\nperformance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful\nVideo Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results\nhighlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more\nsophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches.

Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to\nlinguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon\nLLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,\ngenerating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we\nintervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,\nbalancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.\nFurthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's\noverreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our\nattention manipulation.

Given the\ndistributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual\nconcepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In\nthis paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular\nConcept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a\ngiven query.

Here, we propose a\npoint-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the\nprior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver\nvessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.\nThis adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities\nacross point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS\npublic datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores\ncompared to four pioneering point-based methods.

Space-filling curves are\napplied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute\nefficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to\nlearn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which\nenables standard vision models to process event data without architecture\nchange. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent\nout-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks\nand 10 datasets (Fig.1).

We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and\nunsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.\nEmpirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on\nsafety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.\nComprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to\npreserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling\nlaw for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning\nloss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics.

When approaching a work zone, large\ntrucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures\ncaused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of\nlarge truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated\nwith merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging\nbased on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into\na mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is\ncritical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a\nminimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free\nmerging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in\nresponse to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is\ncompared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based\nmerging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based\nmerging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower\nconflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and\nTime Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.\nFurthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can\nperform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete\nstop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly\nobserved with the baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7LSTM\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u5361\u8f66\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u51b2\u7a81\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u5361\u8f66\u56e0\u4f53\u79ef\u5927\u548c\u76f2\u533a\u591a\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u5408\u5e76\u51b2\u7a81\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u300150%\u548c85%\u5206\u4f4d\u95f4\u9699\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "LSTM\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u51b2\u7a81\u98ce\u9669\uff08TET\u548cTIT\u503c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5361\u8f66\u52a8\u6001\u5408\u5e76\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u6b62\u3002", "conclusion": "LSTM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u5361\u8f66\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with\nfeature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens\nin a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel\ntrigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering\ndeeper insights into adversarial attack patterns.

However,\nthese methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators\nlabel only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion\nmatrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains\ninadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all\ntasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based\nmethod, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to\nintroduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.\nSpecifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion\nmatrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.\nRather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended\nas a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype\nlearning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance\nissues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.\nExtensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves\nup to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average\naccuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "PTBCC\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4ec5\u6807\u6ce8\u5c11\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\uff0c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u4e00\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "PTBCC\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u7ec4\u539f\u578b\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u578b\u4e0a\u7684Dirichlet\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPTBCC\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534715%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad83%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "PTBCC\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt.

To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified\nhierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive\nassessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by\ndual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation\nenvironments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,\nheterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast\nsystem) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into\nstandardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To\nbridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control\nabstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level\nactuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs\non physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM\nintroduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically\nexplores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for\nsafety-critical scenario generation.

Our extensive simulations\ndemonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy\nthan those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant\nwhen the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5316LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u7528\u6237\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u4e13\u4e1aLLM\u96c6\u7fa4\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u54cd\u5e94\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u4e1a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Compared to traditional methods based on\nTransformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based\napproaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic\nnature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

This paper proposes the\nFlexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for\nneural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance\ndegradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,\nwhich is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,\nFAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model\nperformance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures\ndifferences between unimportant units and those that cause performance\ndegradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to\nautomatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more\nefficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.\nAnother advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without\npost-pruning fine-tuning.

For instance, the coreset selection and\ndataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating\nrepresentative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two\nsignificant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate\nthe quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive\nbias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training\nimages require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,\nleading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by\nthe nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a\nDNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the\ngeneralization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory\ncomputing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images\nneed to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR\nenergy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system\nwith a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge\ndevices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free\nnear-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization\nissues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The\nexperimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNMS\u7684\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DNN-free\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aDNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548cDDR\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684DNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728DNN\u4f9d\u8d56\u548cDDR\u8bbf\u95ee\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDE-SNE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08DNN-free\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u548c\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efaNMS\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "NMS\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DQ\u3001DQAS\u3001NeSSA\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "NMS\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548cDDR\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u7684DNN-free\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can\nlead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements\nto kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and\nacquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have\nbeen explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these\nfundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to\nrely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective\nframework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition\nFunction Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a\nlightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various\nkernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration\nbefore expensive evaluations.

As a central contribution,\nwe present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes\ndataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local\ncoordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps\nprovided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and\nnuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an\nalignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A\nmanual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set\nof high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future\nresearch on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of\nAID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery\nserves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion\nprediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that\nreplaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a\n15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory\nprediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery\nas a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated\nvehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are\nunavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain.

Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily\nfocused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although\nthe new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x\nspeedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this\ncapability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix\nmultiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the\nBlackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of\nMXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical\nreasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX\n5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than\nTensorRT-FP8.

We employ a\nstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model\nthrough a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation\nfeature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities\nwithout sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's\ngenuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training\nstrategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training\" stage utilizes\nself-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by\nreinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster\nrobustness in challenging scenarios.

However, existing\nnon-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,\nlayer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt\nto scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical\nbottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further\nlimits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning\npolicies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning\nFramework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design\ndependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports\nreal-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable\nto static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and\nreal-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can\nevaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative\noptimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can\ngenerate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to\n33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,\noutperforming manually designed pruning policies.

In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric\ncondition, namely $\\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the\nsoftmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error\n$\\epsilon$.

This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two\ndistinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and\ntheir associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a\nuser's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully\naddress both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data\nremoval or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work\nintroduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution\nto these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy\ntailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,\nit uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,\nwhich is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any\nremaining data traces among affected clients.

However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this\ndegradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision\ncounterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To\naddress the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an\neffective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.\nUnfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models\nas they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is\nunsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory\nand latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to\nimprove their robustness and generalization ability efficiently.

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT\nobjective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change\nsmoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust\nPerception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the\ncurrent accuracy-robustness trade-off.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism.

Existing research shows that\npre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.\nHowever, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may\ninfluence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.\nIn particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely\nacknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been\nsystematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address\nthis gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed\nusing computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve\ncross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of\na foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across\nmultiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets\ntailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using\nthe medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and\nXRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across\nmodalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective\napplication of this approach.

The\nmain challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple\nquery such as \"Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors\" can\nspan a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to\ndance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to\nretrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for\nthe AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,\nyet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive\ncapability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially\nDecorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:\nfeature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.\nSpecifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text\nfeature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative\nsamples across different spaces.

In this study, we\ninvestigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a\npretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic\ncrosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed\nsurveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting\npedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial\nconditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing\nnormal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or\naltered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while\nsimple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,\nparticularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade\npedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nadversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real\npedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections.
