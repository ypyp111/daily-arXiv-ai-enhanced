The\nscheme preserves positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy\nand a minimum principle of the specific entropy, as well as global properties,\nsuch as total energy balance. The scheme uses an operator splitting approach\ncomposed of two subsystems: the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics\nand a source system. The source system couples the electrostatic potential,\nmomentum, and Lorentz force, thus incorporating electrostatic plasma and\ncyclotron motions. Because of the high-frequency phenomena it describes, the\nsource system is discretized with an implicit time-stepping scheme. We use a\nPDE Schur complement approach for the numerical approximation of the solution\nof the source system. Therefore, it reduces to a single non-symmetric\nPoisson-like problem that is solved for each time step.\n  Our focus with the present work is on the efficient solution of problems\nclose to the magnetic-drift limit. Such asymptotic limit is characterized by\nthe co-existence of slowly moving, smooth flows with very high-frequency\noscillations, spanning timescales that differ by over 10 orders of magnitude,\nmaking their numerical solution quite challenging.\n  We illustrate the capability of the scheme by computing a diocotron\ninstability and present growth rates that compare favorably with existing\nanalytical results. The model, though a simplified version of the\nEuler-Maxwell's system, represents a stepping stone toward electromagnetic\nsolvers that are capable of working in the electrostatic and magnetic-drift\nlimits, as well as the hydrodynamic regime."}

The case of NACA0012 wing\nprofiles at small incidences is then considered.

The zonal flow is driven by an\nimposed forcing in a thin layer near the surface. A meridional circulation is\nset up, analogous to the Ferrel-like cells observed in Jupiter's atmosphere.\nActing on a stably stratified thin surface layer, the meridional flow induces a\nhorizontal temperature anomaly which leads to a gradual reduction of the zonal\nwinds with depth, governed by the thermal wind equation. Our model is a\nBoussinesq plane layer, with gravity acting parallel to the rotation axis. A\nsuite of fully three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations has been\nperformed to investigate the model behaviour. Below the forced stable layer,\nconvection is occurring, typically in the form of tall thin cells. The\nfluctuating components of the three-dimensional flow can be driven by either\nthe convection or the Reynolds stresses associated with the jet shear flow.\nWhen fluctuations are mainly driven by convection in the form of tall thin\ncolumns and the forcing is relatively weak, the horizontal temperature anomaly\npersists much deeper into the interior than when it is driven by shear flow.\nThe zonal jets can therefore extend deep into the interior, consistent with the\nJuno gravity data."}

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form.

Each node is described by two views, composed by the\noriginal features and structural features derived from random walks and\ndegrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi\nGraph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as\nregularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic\nspaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus\nlikely anomalous.

In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal\nanalysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace\nperforms data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and\nknowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,\ncounterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time\noperator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering\ntransparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive\nevaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN\nframework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),\nwhich spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an\nacademic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement\nwith domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance\n(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in\nthe C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live\ndeployment."}

Or training\ndataset size?\n  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI\nAgents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and\nhighlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.\nIn doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to\ntransductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the\ndistribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce\nthe time needed to find solutions to new tasks.\n  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role\nof information in learning is about reduction of time rather than\nreconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a\nuniversal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their\nalgorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the\nobserved power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show\nthat scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on\nbenchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone\nsuper-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can\nbehave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.\nInstead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning\nmodels is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly\nconsidered."}

However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three\nconundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation\nshift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise\nsub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This\ndecoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the\nfeature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between\nstage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across\nall classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL\nconsistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire\nCIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference\nphases."}

To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,\nthis work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent\ndynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the\nhierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale\nstructure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking\nerror, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,\nthe dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately\nleverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of\ninaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and\nobjects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture\nrepresentations across different visual objects in the video facilitates\ncontrollable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video\nreconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video\nprocessing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally\nconsistent video editing."}

We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and\nevaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign\nprovides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%\non BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical\nknowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10\nand typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code\ndata is beneficial even for specialized models."}

Since Large Language Models\n(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their\nconjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or\nproof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this\ngap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the\nevaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing\ncapabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation\npipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is\nsubstantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during\nevaluation.

This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial\ninformation from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further\nenhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware\nadaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of\nfoundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from\nvarious modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the\nquality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of\ninitialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved\nbackbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome\nembeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative\nthan raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)\nto automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with\nrespect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a\nzero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous\ninformation. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses\nstate-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot\ntraining samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.\nCompared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with\nvarious advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,\npresenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs."}

Our\nframework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their\ncorresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without\nrequiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while\nutilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.\nThese results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool\nfor MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments."}

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability.

To remedy this, we propose\n\\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to\npredict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that\ncompels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.\nWe showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA\narchetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual\ntokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual\nfeatures. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we\nintroduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for\nreal-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a\n680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly\noutperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling\nlaw, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size\nincreases."}
