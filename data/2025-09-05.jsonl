This is the same metric that underlies\ncommon visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective\nliterally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare\nit to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of\ntasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of\noptimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight\nimprovement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These\nnew optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the\neffective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature\nacting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of\nthese optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning\nrate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric\nperspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing\npreconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity\ncomparable to that of Adam."}

Experimental investigations\nof rotating magnetoconvection (RMC) in the magnetostrophic regime are therefore\nessential to broadly characterize the properties of local-scale planetary core\nflow. Towards this end, we present here the first thermovelocimetric\nmeasurements of magnetostrophic, liquid metal convection, which are made using\nliquid gallium as the working fluid, at moderate rotation rates (Ekman numbers\n$10^{-4} \\leq Ek\\leq 10^{-5}$) and in the presence of dynamically strong\nmagnetic fields (Elsasser number $\\Lambda=1$). Complementary rotating\nconvection (RC) experiments are performed at the same rotation rates to serve\nas reference cases.

Unlike traditional\ncontact algorithms, the third medium contact introduces a third medium between\ntwo contacting bodies, thereby avoiding the complex treatment of the contact\nconstraints. The approach has been successfully applied in different\napplications in the framework of the finite element method (FEM). As a\ngeneralization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM)\ncan handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for\nmodeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the\nprojection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the\nrank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third\nmedium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which\nfurther complicates the application of VEM to such problems.

Addressing these biases individually proves\ninadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We\ntackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a\nlean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and\nminimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)\ndeliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders\nfor each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the\nclassifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine\nTuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving\na single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to\nrecognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup\nimbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias\nAmplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias\namplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,\nCelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute\nbias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and\ndistribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end\nmultibias solution for visual recognition.

However, existing methods often lack an\nunderstanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate\nnegative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels\nsignificantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we\npropose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative\nimages and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive\nnegative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance\nfar-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the\nin-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that\nare visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning\ncapability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to\nthis subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD\ndetection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an\nadaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task\nsettings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior\nknowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet\nbenchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\\%, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,\nenabling high scalability."}

Unlike\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D\nplane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial\nstructures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the\nvertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis\ninformation when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style\nchannel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting\ntheir ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal\nframework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract\nvoxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical\nslices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained\nspatial details with holistic contextual information.

However, current research lacks both evaluation\nbenchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we\npropose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,\nwhich can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data\nsynthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both\ntextual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning\nBenchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on\nSSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting\nsheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro\nhighlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in\na visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and\nQwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench.

Empirically, we conclude that this new class of\noptimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight\nimprovement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These\nnew optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the\neffective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature\nacting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of\nthese optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning\nrate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric\nperspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing\npreconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity\ncomparable to that of Adam."}

Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit\ngreater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with\ninstruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with\nnuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting\nPrinciples tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust\nand fair model evaluation."}

Understanding\nhow tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,\nhuman-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional\nAI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban\nquarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified\nfrom tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To\nassess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering\nmethod, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color\nthemes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street\nviews, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps\nbetween visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both\nstylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated\nthrough a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and\na multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:\ntourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business\nformats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and\nemotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this\nframework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist\nperception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage\nconservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces."}

Using both\nsupervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale\nexperiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed\nmethod to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same\narchitecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the\nmodel's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain\nclasses in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily\ndetected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious\nsignals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the\naforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research\nefforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in\ninvasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world\nscenarios."}

In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to\nparaphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based\nevaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically\ngenerate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common\nbenchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness.

ChronoGraph offers a\nrealistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware\nevaluation in microservice systems."}
