A central\nquestion is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized\nfunctions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's\ncore cognitive abilities. We introduce \"cyclic ablation,\" an iterative method\nto test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and\nadversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of\ndeception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception\nwas highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior\nafter each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term\nfunctional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this \"neurosurgery\" caused\na gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by\na consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view\nthat complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the\nlimitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability."}

A key challenge lies in confined configurations, where\noptimizing performance requires a deep understanding of the coupled\nhydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonlinearities that govern such flows. In this\nregard, low-order decomposition techniques offer an interpretable framework to\nquantify how nonlinear forcings drive coherent responses and amplify key flow\nstructures. This work, thus, pursues two main objectives: establish a\nresolvent-based framework tailored to high-pressure transcritical fluid flows,\nand characterize the spatio-temporal sensitivity of the resolvent operator\nusing data-driven turbulent base flows. These analyses identify the flow\nresponses and forcings that optimally enhance mixing and heat transfer, along\nwith their characteristic scales. The results of the resolvent framework\nreveals that amplification is dominated by streamwise-elongated structures with\nspanwise periodicity, associated with peak singular values near spanwise\nwavenumbers of order unity. Unlike ideal-gas or incompressible/isothermal\nflows, the dominant forcings arise from thermodynamic fluctuations in the\npseudo-boiling region.

Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely\nphenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into\nsurrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient\nresponse to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable\ninter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and\nnoisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant\nuncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can\nbe efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest\n(QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that\nQMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs.\nWell-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a\ntheoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical\nlinear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is\nverified numerically.

Planning involves\nstructuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible\ncontinuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively\ntransformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and\nencumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on\nvector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact\nsummary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing\nsystematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.\nUsing this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,\npath-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key\naspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent\nto which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the\nreliance of new predictions on earlier computations.

The\ndiscussion could be adapted to any hyperbolic system endowed with an entropy,\nbut we focus on compressible fluid mechanics, in its Eulerian and Lagrangian\nformulations. The unifying element is that we systematically express the update\nof conserved variables as $u^{n+1}=u^n- \\Delta t\\; \\delta u$, where the\nfunctional $\\delta u$ depends on the value of $u$ in the stencil of the scheme.\nThen, one can naturally define a graph connecting the states defining $\\delta\nu$.

We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before\nreasoning.

Existing behavioral control methods face\nsignificant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden\nby user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires\ninvasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with\nAPI-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that\ntransfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,\nwe introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection\n(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.\nWe demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of\nVLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual\ninputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for\nruntime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when\nan underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be\nsteered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based\ninterventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on\nopen-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment\ndirections: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct.

In this\npaper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space\ndynamics to address the question: \"How do diffusion models memorize?\" We show\nthat memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during\nearly denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and\naccelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)\nmemorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is\nlarger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying\npredictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training\nimages into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and\nsteering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of\nintermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and\nreplaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising\nschedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our\nexperiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling\nproperties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable\nperformance of SID-based GR through scaling.

Following prior work\non hinted vs.\\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT\nfaithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans\nfour datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models\n(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in\ncorrectness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data\nleak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator\nexpressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly\nacknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,\ncorrect hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks\nand logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks\nwith lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly\nuneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are\noften adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward\nverbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style\nmatters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style\nprompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance.

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding.

Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a\nstaged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then\nutilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally\nmaking decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach\nhas demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information\nprocessing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various\nmodules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper\npresents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for\nAudiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal\ninformation fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby\nreplacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This\ninnovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates\ninitial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This\nmethodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process\nwhile reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and\ngeneralization capabilities.

Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method.

To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical\ncaching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context\nrepresentations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient\nparallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel\ndecoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR\ndecoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR\nbaselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs\n- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and\naccurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released."}

We first show that the input information available\nto the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the\npreconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on\nfeature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th\npower of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,\nwe prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the\nteacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how\nthe interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three\ncomplementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that\nthe learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced\nby the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting\nreduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate\nthat generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is\naligned with that of the teacher."}

Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted\nmisinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content\nproduced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although\nboth share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP\nresearch focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community\ntargets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often\nspecialized for only one type of fake content.

However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)\nprovide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions\naccessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data\ncontamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework\nthat evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key\nidea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG\nwhere nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one\nfunction consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function\nschemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose\nthe correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows\nusers to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,\nand distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our\nFuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying\ndifficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose\nmodels with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance\ndeclines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected\nirrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong\nmodels often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or\nstale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in\nmulti-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple\nmitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent\nat each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains\nacross models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%\nfor GPT-5."}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate\npotential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still\nremains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game\nprojects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\n  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end\ncoordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of\nrunnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses\na Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints\nand engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces\nexecutable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific\ncomponent binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides\nreal-time error correction through conversational interaction.

In this work, we revisit the\nfoundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a\nsimple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by\naggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This\nobservation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure\nnaturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on\nthis insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN\nencoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node\nfeature noise.

Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves.

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses\non synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and\nasynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,\nand do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting\nintroduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot\nimplicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid\ncollisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the\nsystem, but doing so may cost a lot.

To address this, we introduce operational\nsafety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user\nqueries when tasked with a specific purpose.

Beyond known attack\nvectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable\nto fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive\ndemographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect\noutcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline.

To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting\n(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary\noptimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our\napproach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns\nglobal and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and\nadaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.\nFurthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where\natmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to\nspecialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the\nmodel's ability to capture temporal patterns.

The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data.

We record hours and kilometers of trajectories\nthrough a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.\nWe leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose\nannotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.\nThis makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at\nnight or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems\ndeveloped by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify\ncomponents that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with\ndifferent levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less\nmature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at\nhttps://www.lamaria.ethz.ch."}

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight\nalternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing\nwith simple operations.

Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality\nmonitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect\ndetection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does\nnot hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector\ndimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training\ntime, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable\ntrends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic\ninteractions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,\nsignals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings\nand saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality.

In this work, we\nintroduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion\nmodel via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained\nimage conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the\ncomplex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while\nreserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve\nthis, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect\nthe VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to\nunleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a\nlarge, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.\nFinally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and\nperform instruction tuning on downstream tasks.

In this paper, we propose a method that uses the\nAccelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and\nmore stable model, interacts with the environment independently while\nsimultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the\nfirst stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained\ntransformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.\nAs a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of\nits performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.\nBy conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill\nenvironments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show\nthat applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers\nbut also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of\ntwo.

Recent\nwork has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable\nsignature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV\nrely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and\nintroduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the\ncharge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated\nuncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we\ninfer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling\nrobust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key\nbenefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,\n(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty\nquantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded\nBMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates\n(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method\nreliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while\ncorrectly reporting no peaks in baseline cases.

We argue that safety\nmonitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult\nto assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce\nTruncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes\nfor dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be\ntrained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can\nearly-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger\nguardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:\nby evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger\nguardrails from the same model.

Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning.

For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental.

Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning.

As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular\ninterpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,\nlightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\\texttt{tensordict}$\nand applicable to any $\\texttt{torch}$ model.

Furthermore, we model context\n(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the\nvalue features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can\nsubstantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard\nattention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a\nmodified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with\nmisaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a\nrange of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior\nability to handle misalignment."}

Few-shot learning\nmethods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled\nexamples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot\nlearning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical\napplications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require\nlearning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously\nknown ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot\nclassification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been\nscarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public\ndatabases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for\nstandard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating\nmulti-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a\nstandard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide\nrange of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate\nthat increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training\nexamples per class improves classification performance.

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative\nmemory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal\nthat the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output\n(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary\ncontributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical\nanalyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the\nouter-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced\nand effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam."}

Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --\nmodels must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid\nhallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:\napproaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those\nthat encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct\nanswers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive\nexperiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to\nvanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves\ntruthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models\n(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups.

Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage.

SeMoBridge is\nclosed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,\ncombining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.\nExperiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a\nfraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,\nparticularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots).

We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

The\ndifficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed\ntopic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its\ninstances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can\nhappen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens\nof thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing\nand evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally\ninfeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit\nproblem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a\ncost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its\ndifficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics\nwithin a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of\nfinding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that\nvarious bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force\nsearching the most challenging topics."}

These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups.

Beyond known attack\nvectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable\nto fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive\ndemographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect\noutcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic\nvariations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed\nanalysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with\nperturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the\nviolations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work\nreinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to\nprevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for\ndevelopers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs\nwithout compromising fairness or reliability."}
