However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u540c\u610f\u504f\u5dee\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u63a5\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002MLLMs\u56e0\u5176\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u63a5\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u6b65\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "SGV\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fMLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe20\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SGV\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u540c\u610f\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This\nstudy numerically investigates the settling behavior of multisize solid\nparticles in a non-newtonian slurry inside a semicircular open channel (flume).\nThe non-newtonian slurry is modelled using a three-dimensional (3D) unsteady\nEulerian-Eulerian (E-E) model coupled with the Hershel-Bulkley (HB) rheological\nmodel. A detailed sensitivity analysis of drag models is performed to establish\nthe solid-fluid interaction in the slurry flow. The numerical model is\nvalidated with the experimental data from the literature and shows a fair\nagreement. The validated model is used to simulate the settling behavior of the\nslurry in the flume. The mean particle diameter of the solid particles in the\nslurry is in the range of 75-296 $\\mu$m with a median diameter of 188 $\\mu$m.\nThe effect of particle size distributions (PSDs), flume inclination, bubble\nsize and bubble volume fraction on the particle settling inside the flume is\ninvestigated in the parametric study. The analysis of our results revealed that\nthe settling of solids is significantly affected by PSDs in the open channel\nsystem.

However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically\nbuilt with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability\nto capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a\npermutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based\nsurrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study\ndeveloped a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U\nNet-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate\npredictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming\ntimesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model\ntemporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample\nmechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'\ncontact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements\nin computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN\nmodel was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot\nforming case study using aluminium alloys. Results demonstrate that the RUGNN\nmodel provides accurate deformation predictions closely matching ground truth\nFE simulations and outperforming several baseline GNN architectures.

Moreover, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require\npredefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data\ncontaining many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for\naccurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and\nspatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically\napplying deformable filters based on offset.

Materials and\nMethods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random\nforest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,\nSurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an\nattention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.\nPerformance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key\npredictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved\nthe highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)\nand baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by\ndynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative\nclinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most\ncontributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone\ndisorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most\nimpactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention\nmechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential\nnature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher\naccuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical\nadoption.

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u6e05\u6d01\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u201d\uff08CNS\uff09\u9996\u6b21\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4Kolmogorov\u6e4d\u6d41\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u63a5\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff08DNS\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u79bbCNS\u57fa\u51c6\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6e4d\u6d41\uff08\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1CNS\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CNS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u622a\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u820d\u5165\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eDNS\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "DNS\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8f68\u8ff9\u56e0\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u8fc5\u901f\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u6d41\u573a\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea7\u8054\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5747\u4e0eCNS\u57fa\u51c6\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "CNS\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u6e4d\u6d41\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86DNS\u5728\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive\ntraining of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial\ncomputational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward\nmodels or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and\nefficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image\ngeneration and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive\nexperiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO\ncompared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the\ntrained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent\nimages. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a\npaired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations\nand comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of\ngenerative models.

A\nGaussian filter decomposes the temporal coefficients into low-frequency (slow)\nand high-frequency (fast) components, enabling a two-branch modeling strategy.\nEach branch is mapped into a latent representation using a nonlinear\nautoencoder and evolved via neural ODEs that incorporate time modulation. This\nstrategy reduces the system from an original state space dimension of 10^5 to a\ncompact 20-dimensional latent space while preserving the essential multiscale\ndynamics. Our model achieves accurate reconstruction of instantaneous flow\nstructures, Reynolds stresses, energy autocorrelations and long-time\nquantities, such as angular momentum and wall observables.

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten\nspatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones\n(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong\ngeneral framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-VFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "ST-VFM\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u7a7a\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d41\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884VFM\u548c\u540eVFM\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-VFM\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-VFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Aime\nreplaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive\narchitecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that\ncontinuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution\nfeedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,\nassembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and\n(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of\ntruth for coherent, system-wide state awareness.

The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered\ntunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while\nmaintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the\nbehavior seen in flying insects.

To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve\nAssisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and\nanalysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct\ninterpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the\ninter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via\ncell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and\noutputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted\nKaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.\nThe LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the\nsyntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves\naverage F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%\nidentifying transitive cell execution dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCRABS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d45\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3Python\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60Python\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u65b0\u6267\u884c\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002LLM\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCRABS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d45\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\uff08AST\uff09\u548cLLM\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u89e3\u51b3\u5269\u4f59\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u56fe\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2aKaggle\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLLM\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8698%\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\uff0cCRABS\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523098%\u548c99%\u3002", "conclusion": "CRABS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

The findings\nrevealed that increasing the carboxymethyl cellulose concentration (0.1% to\n1.0%) and continuous phase flow rate (10 {\\mu}L/min to 30 {\\mu}L/min) reduces\ndroplet length by 53% and 45%, respectively. while increasing the dispersed\nphase flow rate (2 {\\mu}L/min to 18 {\\mu}L/min) and interfacial tension results\nin increased droplet length by 62% and 42%. At lower concentrations of\ncarboxymethyl cellulose, plug-shaped droplets fully occupy the channel width in\nthe squeezing regime. As concentration increases, a transition to the dripping\nand jetting regimes is observed. The study further explores non-dimensional\nparameters, expressing the Weber and modified Capillary numbers as functions of\nflow rate and interfacial tension. These insights impact drug delivery,\nmaterial synthesis, and microfluidic technologies requiring precise droplet\ncontrol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u77ac\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u526a\u5207\u7a00\u5316\u975e\u725b\u987f\u6d41\u4f53\uff08\u7fa7\u7532\u57fa\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7d20\u6eb6\u6db2\uff09\u5bf9\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u88c5\u7f6e\u4e2d\u77ff\u7269\u6cb9\u6ef4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d53\u5ea6\u3001\u6d41\u901f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u5f20\u529b\u5bf9\u6db2\u6ef4\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u725b\u987f\u6d41\u4f53\u5728\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u88c5\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6db2\u6ef4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u8f93\u9001\u548c\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6db2\u6ef4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8026\u5408\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u4f53\u79ef\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u754c\u9762\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u7fa7\u7532\u57fa\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7d20\u6eb6\u6db2\u5bf9\u6db2\u6ef4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u52a0\u7fa7\u7532\u57fa\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7d20\u6d53\u5ea6\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u6d41\u901f\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u6db2\u6ef4\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u5206\u6563\u76f8\u6d41\u901f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u5f20\u529b\u5219\u589e\u52a0\u6db2\u6ef4\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u6d53\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u8fd8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6db2\u6ef4\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u6324\u538b\u6001\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u6ef4\u843d\u6001\u548c\u55b7\u5c04\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u6db2\u6ef4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u8f93\u9001\u548c\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The experiments were conducted with a fixed Morton\nnumber, $Mo = 2.64 \\times 10^{-11}$, with Bond, Galilei, and Reynolds numbers\nin the ranges $0.08 \\lesssim Bo \\lesssim 0.33$, $71 \\lesssim Ga \\lesssim 194$,\nand $132 \\lesssim Re \\lesssim 565$, respectively. The initial dimensionless\nhorizontal distance between the wall and the bubble centroid was systematically\nvaried, $0.3 \\lesssim L \\lesssim 5$, and the bubble trajectories from two\northogonal vertical planes were captured using high-speed imaging. While the\nbubble rising paths were stable without the wall presence for all the cases,\nthe results reveal that wall proximity significantly affects the rising path,\ndepending on $Bo$ (or $Ga$) and $L$. A map with four distinct interaction\nregimes and their transitions is obtained: (i) Rectilinear Path (RP) at low\n$Bo$ and large $L$, with negligible wall influence; (ii) Migration Away (MA) at\nhigher $Bo$ and moderate-to-large $L$, with lateral deviation from the wall;\n(iii) Collision and Migration Away (C+MA) at high $Bo$ and small $L$, where\nbubbles first collide and then migrate away; and (iv) Periodic Collisions (PC)\nat low $Bo$, where repeated wall impacts occur due to competing forces.

However, these methods consider cells as\nindependent data points of population distributions. With spatial\ntranscriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic\ncell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key\ncomputational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such\ncomplex interactive cellular dynamics.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in\nscenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different\nsession or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the\ncorrelation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in\nunstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint\nvariation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure\nmodes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,\nwe propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame\nAlignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that\ncombines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,\nfollowed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric\nconsistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.

In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the\nreward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a\nregret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we\npresent a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{HSAT})$ for\nepisodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per\nepisode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is\nthe number of episodes.

Next, we develop algorithms that\nachieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$.

While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local\nforecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in\nhandling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.\nThese methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally\nexpensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In\ncontrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance\nprediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through\nglobalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load\nforecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of\ndifferent modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore\nfeature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how\nglobalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In\naddition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its\npotential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the\nbalance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series\nclustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming\nmodels and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.\nThrough extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity\nload, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently\noutperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global\nfeatures and clustering techniques.

However,\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components\nare vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling\nlayers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our\nmethod effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details\nafter demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and\neffectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial\nrobustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is\ncrucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video\ncompression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental\nresults show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to\nexisting FR and NR VQA models.

However, their deployment is\nchallenging due to the substantial computational resources required.\nPower-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this\ndifficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently\ndequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on\nGPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit\nmanipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization\nframework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in\nextremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference\nthrough more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the\nquantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)\ninitialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)\nrefine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT\npost-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer\nquantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our\nPoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating\npoint inference and leads to $3.67\\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and\n$1.63\\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684PoT\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u90e8\u7f72\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u800c\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709PoT\u91cf\u5316\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6b65\u9aa4\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e76\u6821\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57282-\u548c3-bit\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u578bPoT\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly\ndiscovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios.

The\nproposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance\nduring the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term\nmemory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and\nadopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning\nefficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG.

FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we\napply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in single-scale settings.

(2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from\na fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the\ndesign of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood.\nIn contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control\nsettings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with\na shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative\nmodel of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch\nsetting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only\n$\\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a\ngenerative model jumps to $\\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the\nsubstantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key\nquestion in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration\ninherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable\nRL even possible?\n  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular\nMDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our\nmain result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging\nthe gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a\nmatching $\\tilde{\\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under\nthe common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in\nthe episodic setting of $\\tilde{\\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of\nour algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u5bf9\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u6279\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5df2\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\u8868\u683cMDP\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86$\tilde{O}(S^2A)$\u548c$\tilde{O}(S^2A)$\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u975e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u663e\u8457\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4$S$\u65b9\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002"}}

Existing methods regard the RGB\ndomain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such\nas daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the\ndomain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple\nsubdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper\nproposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In\nterms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)\nmodule in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content\ninformation being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can\ndecouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In\nterms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which\nrealizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.\nMeanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the\nbaseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR\ndatasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on\nthe FLIR-ADAS dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u8026-\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684SS-DC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eRGB-IR\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u8026\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06RGB\u57df\u89c6\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u57df\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u591a\u5b50\u57df\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u767d\u5929\u3001\u591c\u665a\u3001\u96fe\u5929\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eRGB-IR\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e42\u7b49\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff08SAID\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u5149\u8c31\u5904\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8026\u5408\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRGB-IR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709UDAOD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eFLIR-ADAS\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026-\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347RGB-IR\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes\nall embeddings from different models and code at\nhttps://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work\nprovides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly\ndetection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GloVe\u3001BERT\u3001LLaMa\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08AUROC\u3001AUPRC\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u77e9\u9635\u5448\u73b0\u4f4e\u79e9\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression\nstrategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from\nthe global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we\nintroduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes\ncorrespondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted\nscene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,\nwe align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby\nobtaining a coarse pose estimation.

Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality.

The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes.

Using this,\nit is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong\npredictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this\nnew tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and\narrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the\nactivation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise\nwhen the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic\npermutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a\ncontinuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings\ncorroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended\ninductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in\nrepresentations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of\notherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69).

In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines.

To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a\nlarge-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in\nrealistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\\times$3 larger than\nprevious datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA,\nforming a novel 3D$\\times$33D dataset with 7$\\times$3 more height layers than\nprior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet\nwith 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce\nRadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D\nconvolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware\nscenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based\non sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate\nthat RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich,\nhigh-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work\nprovides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D\nenvironment-aware communication.

The retained tokens are compressed\nthrough a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing\ncomputational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric\nattention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.\nBSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning\nlevels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%\non DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism.

Our complexity\nanalysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of\nparameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.\nFor further study, the source code of our method is available at\nhttps://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u957f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5f00\u653e\u653f\u7b56\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f29\u653e-\u79fb\u4f4d\u5668\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u62a4\u53ca\u786c\u8f6f\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u8f83\u5c11\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables\naccurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs.

Furthermore, we\nintroduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an\nAttribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual\nLarge Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates\nMulti-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy.

Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal\nestimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting\ngradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits\nclassical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric\nefficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment\neffects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces\nbias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators\nand prior post-hoc approaches.

We evaluate\nDVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it\nagainst recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).\nAdditionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of\nforward KL divergence.

By learning geometry and\nmotion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms\nexisting 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading\ndynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\\times$ faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpatialTrackerV2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u76843D\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u53163D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5c063D\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u81ea\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u67093D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd530%\uff0c\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb50\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SpatialTrackerV2\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u76843D\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}
