When an airfoil or hydrofoil, for\nexample, undergoes time-dependent motion, nonlinear flow phenomena such as\ndynamic stall can emerge. The present work experimentally investigates the\ninteraction between a hydrofoil and surface gravity waves. The waves impose\nperiodic fluctuations of the velocity magnitude and orientation, causing a\nsteadily translating hydrofoil to be susceptible to dynamic stall at large wave\nforcing amplitudes. Simultaneous measurement of both the forces acting on the\nhydrofoil and the flow around it by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV)\nare performed, to properly characterise the hydrofoil-wave interaction. In an\nattempt at alleviating the impact of the flow unsteadiness via passive flow\ncontrol, a bio-inspired tubercle geometry is applied along the hydrofoil\nleading edge. This geometry is known to delay stall in steady cases but has\nscarcely been studied in unsteady flow conditions. The vortex structures\nassociated with dynamic stall are identified, and their trajectories,\ndimension, and strength characterised. This analysis is performed for both\nstraight- and tubercled-leading-edge geometries, with tubercles found to\nqualitatively modify the flow behaviour during dynamic stall. Contrary to\nprevious studies, direct measurements of lift do not evidence any strong\nmodification by tubercles. Drag-driven horizontal force fluctuations, however,\nwhich have not previously been measured in this context, are found to be\nstrongly attenuated. This decrease is quantified, and a physical model based on\nthe flow observations is finally proposed."}

This\nnonstandard L1 formulation is used to construct the NSFD scheme for a\nCaputo-type time-fractional initial value problem. The absolute stability of\nthe resulting scheme is rigorously examined using the boundary locus method,\nand its performance is validated through numerical simulations on test examples\nfor various choices of denominator functions. Based on this framework, two\nexplicit NSFD schemes are developed for 1D and 2D cases of the Caputo-type\nTFDE. Their stability is further assessed through the discrete energy method,\nwith particular focus on the expansion of stability region relative to SFD\nschemes. The convergence of the proposed NSFD schemes is also established.\nFinally, a comprehensive set of numerical experiments is conducted to\ndemonstrate the accuracy and stability advantages of proposed methods, with\nresults presented through tables and graphical illustrations."}

Using the NIH\nChest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest\nX-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three\nprompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and\ncorrection-based reflective prompts.

To\naddress this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement\nframework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables\nindividual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional\nexpression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four\nlightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent\nspaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively.

To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce\northogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate\nmotion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.\nThe learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared\nvisual priors with audio input.

Finally, we introduce a\nsummarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for\ncomparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on\nTracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The\nfindings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for\ntraceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly\nperforming sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation\naccuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness."}

This structure is then used to guide action\nselection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting\nthem accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when\nneeded. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,\nCausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without\nrequiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the\nOvercooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four\nLLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.\nExperimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions\nand improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming\nstrong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of\ncausality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and\ngeneralisable multi-agent LLM systems."}

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset.

A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability.

Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a\nvision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective\nreasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a\nsupervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.\nBy further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is\nable to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate\nconclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive\nexperiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%\non Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will\nbe made publicly available."}

Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation.

FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,\nrobustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and\nNon-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it\nwith state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces\nmalicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a\nmodel retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP\nachieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving\nstorage compared to the SOTA."}

In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights\ninto SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our\nfinding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate\nperturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep\nevaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse\n(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are\ninefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can\nbe pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the\nCIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the\nrequired attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in\nwhite-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable\nattack success rate."}

LCRReg requires no concept\nlabels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to\nsynthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for\npredefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces\nassociated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and\nreal-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly\nimproves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective\neven in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy\nbinary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic\nspurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared\nto baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc\nconcept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic\nstrategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept\nsupervision.

Can we trust the prediction of compressed\nmodels just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing\nwork has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related\nperformance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee\ntrust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence\nevaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base\ntheir predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to\nmeasure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures\nwhether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted\nprobabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability\ndiagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its\nmultiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:\nnatural language inference and paraphrase identification.

In this paper,\nwe introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that\nrestores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch\nsizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster\nconvergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging\ngradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component\nof the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the\nFisher-metric."}

In this process, benchmarks in the\nscientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning\ncapabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key\nchallenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in\nmultilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive\nmodality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge\npoints. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and\nchallenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs\ncover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and\nsupport five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We\nconducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source\nmodels, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for\nexisting MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini\nachieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly\nhigher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies.

To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}.
