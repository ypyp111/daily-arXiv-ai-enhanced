This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM:\nM2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary\nconditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and\ntwo space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at\nleast for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves\nregardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several\napproaches to handle the fact that q > N , we elect the so-called ''scalar''\napproach (which despite its name, also works when N > 1) as method of choice\nfor more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the\ncoefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion\nrelation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in\nthe spirit of analytic combinatorics.

We also\nconsider inference methods that impact feedback performance, including\nin-context learning, chain-of-thought, and access to environment dynamics.

By explicitly capturing fine-grained query-model interactions, our\nrouter predicts both response quality and generation cost, achieving up to 6.6%\nimprovement in Average Improvement in Quality (AIQ) and 2.9% in maximum\nperformance over existing routers. To robustly balance performance and cost, we\npropose an exponential reward function that enhances stability across user\npreferences. The resulting architecture is lightweight, generalizes effectively\nacross domains, and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to prior methods,\nestablishing a new standard for cost-aware LLM routing."}

We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and\nlocal neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning,\nparticularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework\nensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based\noptimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN\nuses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for\nlater ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key\ncomponents: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of\ndifferent meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more\ninformative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a\ncorrelation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding\nmatrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner\ndiversity.

This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making\ndomain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents\nthat, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is\nscientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),\nand enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-\nand closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided\nprompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus\nfine-tuned variants.

Automated detection remains challenging due to the\ndiffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy\nconcerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel\nprivacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical\npriors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.\nSpecifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea\nmanifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a\nfixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red\nchannel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on\ndiagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and\nexclude identity-revealing features.

Core contributions of MCP-AgentBench include:\nthe establishment of a robust MCP testbed comprising 33 operational servers\nwith 188 distinct tools; the development of a benchmark featuring 600\nsystematically designed queries distributed across 6 distinct categories of\nvarying interaction complexity; and the introduction of MCP-Eval, a novel\noutcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing real-world task success.\nThrough extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, we provide\nfoundational insights. MCP-AgentBench aims to equip the research community with\na standardized and reliable framework to build, validate, and advance agents\ncapable of fully leveraging MCP's transformative benefits, thereby accelerating\nprogress toward truly capable and interoperable AI systems."}

Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each\ncommunication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and\ntransmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a\nsingle bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining\nbits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit\nwhile maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and\nNon-IID settings.

Common\npolicy-based methods are either on-policy and do not effectively learn from\noff-policy data (e.g. PPO), or have poor empirical performance in the\ndiscrete-action setting (e.g. SAC). Consequently, starting from discrete SAC\n(DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First,\nwe determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the\nprimary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by\nmerely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as\nDQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic\nframework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an\nm-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard\npolicy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the\nresulting actor objective.

We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among\nvisual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,\nwe analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising\ndirections for future research."}

This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both\nperformance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance\ndisparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third\n(tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a\nconvolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves\nclassification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from\n0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond\nimproving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic\ninsights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions\nindicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high\nintra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary\nlimiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single\nmode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically\nplausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a\nmethodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model\nmay be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert\ndecision-making in forensic age estimation."}

In this paper, we present a\nfirst study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free\napplication that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using\nred-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks\ntrained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist.\nWith an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable\nperformance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can\nidentify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used\nto provide immediate feedback to the users. In summary, this work marks a first\nstep toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for\nvision abnormalities worldwide."}

Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint\nmutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during\nearly learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a\ntransition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately\nactionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system\nfailures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad\ncollapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action\ncoupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts\naction-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships.
