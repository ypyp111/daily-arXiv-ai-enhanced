### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率的空间细节恢复和光谱保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度

Method: 结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取的SSUF模块，可集成到标准2D卷积架构中；提出包含空间和光谱梯度分量的自定义损失函数

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数能有效提升高光谱超分辨率的性能，同时保持较低的模型复杂度

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布和继承偏见的可预测模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误会在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。当前对幻觉的理解仍不完整且碎片化，缺乏连贯理解会导致解决方案只能缓解表面症状而非根本原因。

Method: 提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，使用任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 调查发现幻觉通常源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承偏见，为开发更稳健有效的解决方案提供了基础。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，这项调查为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更稳健和有效的幻觉解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性约束，提升视觉-语言-动作模型对多模态扰动的鲁棒性，在17种扰动下显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观测等多模态扰动，需要开发全面的多模态鲁棒性方法。

Method: 采用离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声，通过输入变化保持任务语义一致性，并使用多臂老虎机框架自动识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，RobustVLA相比基线在17种扰动下绝对提升12.6%（pi0骨干）和10.4%（OpenVLA骨干），推理速度提升50.6倍，在真实FR5机器人上提升65.6%。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效解决了VLA模型的多模态鲁棒性问题，在多种扰动场景下均表现出色，特别适合真实机器人部署。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC框架通过无监督发现模型内在能力，基于梯度学习轨迹进行数据归因，并使用能力感知课程学习，仅用5%数据就能超越全数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视其潜在学习能力，导致数据效率低下且容易产生性能退化。

Method: 无监督发现内在能力，基于梯度学习轨迹进行数据归因，通过平衡选择和分阶段排序构建能力感知课程。

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据就在多模态基准测试中超越了全数据训练效果。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建模块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度递进，且缺少跨语言任务。真实世界图像通常只包含单一文化，使得基准测试相对容易。

Method: 构建了包含三个难度递进任务的基准：从基础视觉识别到高级文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成。包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对。

Result: 评估了11个开源MLLMs，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距，表明C³B对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战。

Conclusion: C³B基准测试揭示了当前MLLMs在文化意识能力方面的不足，鼓励未来研究推进MLLMs的文化意识能力发展。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了6个开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见问题，发现在医院相关职业的生成图像中存在系统性职业刻板印象，如护士总是女性、外科医生主要是男性，且不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意领域的广泛应用，其输出往往嵌入并放大了社会偏见。本研究旨在调查这些模型在性别表征方面的系统性偏见问题。

Method: 使用6个最先进的开源模型，通过精心设计的提示词，为5种医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析性别分布和模型差异。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士总是女性，外科医生主要是男性。不同模型存在显著差异：Qwen-Image和SDXL强制男性主导，HiDream-I1-dev结果混合，FLUX.1-dev在大多数角色中偏向女性。提示词修饰语进一步调节性别平衡。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型中的性别偏见既具有系统性又具有模型特异性。提示词措辞在塑造人口统计结果中起着关键作用，需要偏见感知设计、平衡默认设置和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象的强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词反演框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复出提示词模板，展示了提示词交易中的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型催生了提示词交易市场，但提示词本身存在被盗风险，这是一个未被充分研究的安全威胁。

Method: 将模板窃取视为顺序决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，将攻击成本降低到现有基线的13%以下，并能有效泛化到不同图像风格。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中紧迫的安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，自动验证视觉语言模型生成解释的忠实性，通过反事实测试检测解释与预测之间的因果不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的因果因素，这种可信度与忠实性不匹配带来技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLMs上，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT能够有效识别模型解释中引用的概念在因果测试中失败的情况，为模型可信度评估提供自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe框架通过分层解耦方法解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像理解中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能并减少内存使用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳是因为无法识别小物体，但本文发现主要问题是复杂背景干扰而非物体大小

Method: 提出分层解耦框架(HiDe)，包含Token-wise Attention Decoupling(TAD)识别关键信息token，以及Layout-Preserving Decoupling(LPD)从背景中解耦目标区域并重构紧凑表示

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新的SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别提升至92.1%和91.6%，内存使用减少75%

Conclusion: HiDe框架证明背景干扰是高分辨率图像理解的主要瓶颈，通过分层解耦方法有效解决了这一问题，且无需额外训练

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节，特别针对灰度变化引起的语义边缘模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中由于阴影、低对比度区域等灰度变化导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高低频分量来优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务表述为下一个路径点预测，提出Max-V1单阶段端到端自动驾驶框架，在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比基线提升30%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考自动驾驶问题，将其视为序列生成任务，利用VLM的生成能力实现从相机输入直接预测轨迹的端到端解决方案。

Method: 提出Max-V1框架，采用单次生成范式，利用统计建模原理设计监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家示范中学习复杂驾驶策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，整体提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化性能，具有跨车辆鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了能够实现基本驾驶行为的模型，为开发更强大的自动驾驶智能体奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的设计空间探索方法和框架，用于压缩卷积神经网络，解决了低秩分解中的多个挑战，包括最优秩选择、设计空间大、微调时间长等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩分解技术面临秩选择困难、设计空间庞大、微调时间长、与不同层类型和分解方法兼容性有限等挑战，需要一种更有效的压缩方法。

Method: 基于特征图相似性的新秩选择策略，一次性微调过程，兼容所有卷积层和全连接层，集成六种不同的低秩分解技术（卷积层和全连接层各三种），在单个模型中组合使用多种方法。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著的压缩效果，精度损失最小，优于多种最先进技术。

Conclusion: 提出的端到端框架有效解决了低秩分解的多个挑战，通过组合多种分解方法和基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，实现了更好的压缩效果和兼容性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型仍难以准确解释复杂的视觉-文本关系，提出的多代理标注系统在图像描述生成方面优于所有评估模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元(USN)度量的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN神经元并保留高USN神经元来减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，并在鲁棒关键点检测任务中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉和机器人应用中广泛使用，但现有认证训练和鲁棒性认证方法面临过参数化问题，导致紧密度和可扩展性受限。需要解决语义变换扰动（如亮度和对比度）下的鲁棒性验证挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的基于USN的剪枝方法有效解决了深度神经网络的过参数化问题，在保持模型表达能力的同时显著提升了鲁棒性认证的紧密度和可扩展性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Motivation: 高光谱异常检测在民用和军事应用中很重要，但由于复杂环境和先验知识有限，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 使用基于传输的数学模型描述高光谱像素，将其视为模板模式的变形观测，在SCDT域中应用无监督子空间建模技术构建背景信号模型。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于传输变换的方法为高光谱异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，在复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LoRA适配器的混合水印框架MOLM，通过二进制密钥激活生成模型中的轻量级适配器来实现鲁棒的水印嵌入和提取，解决了现有水印方法易受失真、自适应移除和密钥更新成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，这引发了检测合成图像和溯源来源的紧迫需求。现有水印方法对实际失真脆弱、易受自适应攻击移除，且密钥更新成本高昂。

Method: 提出通用水印框架，将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的关键依赖扰动。具体实现MOLM方法，通过二进制密钥激活残差块和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器，避免密钥特定的重新训练。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，能够鲁棒地恢复密钥，抵抗失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和对提取器的黑盒对抗攻击。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性，为生成图像的水印溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Motivation: 现有开放世界检测方法存在已知和未知类别间的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知召回率下降和已知类别准确率退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用SCG函数选择与已知对象显著不同的未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标分离已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类别的区分性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别将已知类别准确率提高了2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率相比领先基线提高了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式数据发现和表示学习方法，有效解决了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Motivation: 虽然已有许多研究改进潜在扩散模型(LDM)，但针对内在潜在空间改进的研究仍然稀缺。本文旨在通过增强变分自编码器(VAE)的潜在空间表示来提升LDM在遥感应用中的效果。

Method: 提出ExpDWT-VAE方法，采用双分支结构：一个分支通过卷积操作处理空间域输入，另一个分支通过2D Haar小波分解、卷积操作和逆DWT重建提取和处理频域特征。两个分支融合形成集成空间-频率表示，再通过卷积和对角高斯映射精炼为鲁棒的潜在表示。

Result: 使用TerraFly地图系统中的新卫星图像数据集进行验证，多个性能指标的实验结果都证明了所提方法在增强潜在空间表示方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过离散小波变换增强VAE潜在空间表示的方法能够有效提升潜在扩散模型在遥感应用中的性能，为卫星图像处理提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想化的观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角中固有的感知伪影（如遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致训练假设与部署现实之间的差距，限制了模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将提炼的历史特征条件化到预测解码器；基于EgoTraj-Bench基准进行训练。

Result: BiFlow实现了最先进的性能，平均减少minADE和minFDE 10-15%，表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正能够抵抗真实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Motivation: 探索零样本医学视觉语言模型在胸部X光片自动诊断中的潜力，特别是与监督CNN模型的性能对比，以及如何通过简单校准方法释放VLM的诊断能力。

Method: 在两个诊断任务（肺炎检测和肺结核检测）上比较监督CNN与零样本VLM BiomedCLIP的性能，并引入决策阈值校准方法来优化VLM的分类性能。

Result: 校准后VLM性能显著提升：肺炎检测F1分数从低于CNN提升至0.8841（超过CNN的0.8803）；肺结核检测F1分数从0.4812提升至0.7684，接近CNN的0.7834。

Conclusion: 适当的校准对于充分发挥零样本视觉语言模型的诊断潜力至关重要，使其能够匹配甚至超越高效的任务特定监督模型。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法存在高频结构细节保留不足和拟合高频时学习噪声的问题

Method: 提出频率带选择策略、基于Lipschitz常数的参数优化方法、以及频谱分离和低秩重建模块

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet通过频率控制成功解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with

First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

TL;DR: MathSticks是一个用于视觉符号组合推理的基准测试，通过移动火柴棍来修正错误方程，评估模型在视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在组合推理方面存在不足，需要统一的测试基准来评估视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性的综合能力。

Method: 创建包含140万个生成实例的基准测试，涵盖文本引导和纯视觉设置，系统性地测试数字规模、移动复杂度、解决方案多样性和运算符变化。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型发现显著局限性：闭源模型仅能处理简单案例，开源模型在视觉模式下失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进跨视觉和符号的组合推理提供了严格的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Yuheng2000/MathSticks.

*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用正常和异常样本作为参考的通用异常检测方法NAGL，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了现实场景中可用的异常样本所包含的宝贵信息。

Method: 提出NAGL框架，包含残差挖掘(RM)和异常特征学习(AFL)两个关键组件，利用正常-异常参考残差提取异常模式并自适应学习异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的通用异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，为更准确高效的跨域异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF是一种高效的图像特征提取技术，通过融合相对特征和绝对特征来增强基于图像的迭代方法选择，在稀疏线性系统求解中实现了5.86%-11.50%的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的选择方法可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致相同的选择和次优方法选择。

Method: RAF技术同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征，以及对应的数值作为绝对特征，创建全面的矩阵表示。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的评估显示，RAF将稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统图像选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过防止特征模糊性提高了选择准确性，释放了基于图像选择方法的潜力。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的生成式先验方法，通过利用视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来引导被遮挡手部姿态的精细化重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时3D手部姿态重建的模糊性问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如affordance）解决此类模糊性的启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布，通过大视觉语言模型推断手-物体交互的affordance感知文本描述来引导姿态精细化。

Result: 在具有严重遮挡的HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的扩散精细化方法显著提升了手部姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: affordance引导的精细化能够将遮挡区域重建为更准确且功能连贯的手部姿态，证明了上下文知识在手部姿态估计中的重要性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有方法在压缩token时忽视了压缩导致的特征空间扰动会增加学习难度的问题

Method: 通过将token压缩引入的特征空间扰动分解为token维度和层维度，分别引入token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 大量实验证明了所提框架在有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面的优越表现

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难，显著提升了多模态大模型的效率

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench是首个用于超声心动图基础模型的标准化基准测试，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归和5个分类任务，评估了心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器在不同协议下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型应用有限，缺乏标准化评估基准。现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，难以比较，且超声心动图存在噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准化测试套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估多种基础模型，包括心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 不同模型家族展现互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学意义轴。通用编码器迁移能力强，但在视图分类和细微病理识别等精细区分上表现不佳。

Conclusion: CardioBench建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供实用指导，通过发布预处理、分割和公开评估流程促进标准化比较。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从粗到精的级联扩散框架，结合概率建模与级联细化来解决3D手部姿态重建中的姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性模型在处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节引起的姿态模糊时存在困难，而现有的概率方法仅限于单阶段估计，无法在不进行细化的情况下产生准确的3D重建。

Method: 采用两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段是联合扩散模型，采样多样的3D关节假设；第二阶段是网格潜在扩散模型，在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将概率建模与级联细化相结合，解决了3D手部姿态重建中的姿态模糊问题，并实现了高精度的重建效果。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Forestpest-YOLO框架，专门针对林业遥感图像中的农业害虫检测问题，通过集成SPD-Conv、CSPOK和VarifocalLoss等创新模块，在小目标检测和极端数据不平衡问题上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 林业遥感图像中的农业害虫检测面临诸多挑战：目标微小、严重遮挡、与杂乱背景视觉相似，导致传统目标检测模型因细粒度特征丢失和数据不平衡问题而表现不佳。

Method: 基于YOLOv8架构，引入三个创新模块：1) SPD-Conv无损下采样模块，保留小目标的高分辨率细节；2) CSPOK跨阶段特征融合块，增强多尺度特征表示并抑制背景噪声；3) VarifocalLoss损失函数，使模型关注高质量和难分类样本。

Result: 在自建的ForestPest数据集上进行广泛实验，Forestpest-YOLO实现了最先进的性能，在小目标、遮挡害虫检测方面显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感图像中害虫检测的关键挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

TL;DR: 本文展示了在微生物学图像分析中，使用少量标注数据即可达到与传统方法相当性能的视觉基础模型，特别是MaskDINO在仅150张图像上微调就能接近YoloV9的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注和模型训练，过程耗时耗力。本文旨在证明在解决新的视觉任务时，无需进行大量标注即可获得良好性能。

Method: 收集了5000张带有边界框标注的培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集方法以及少样本和低样本场景。对比了三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在任务特定指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO在仅150张图像上微调就能达到与广泛训练的YoloV9模型接近的性能，在仅25张图像时仍能保持竞争力，在约70%的样本上表现可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据量的一小部分匹配其性能，使得自动化微生物系统的开发更早启动，迭代改进更快，且具有比传统模型更优的上限性能。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

TL;DR: 提出自适应共享专家(ASE)框架，在基于LoRA的MoE中引入共享专家，通过路由器计算的门控权重实现从单任务到多任务学习的平滑过渡，提升专家专业化和协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务到多任务学习转换过程中存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 在LoRA-based MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家联合归一化门控权重；通过增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，ASE在各种配置下持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE框架通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中的知识共享和专家协作问题，提升了多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或总序列时长的灵活性。

Method: 提出了Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)来支持任意时间戳插值，以及将长序列生成分解为分段帧合成的方法，采用外观-运动解耦条件策略确保跨段时空连续性。

Result: 在2x到32x的多尺度帧插值基准测试中，ArbInterp在所有场景下都优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp通过创新的时间戳感知位置编码和分段生成策略，成功实现了任意时间戳和任意长度的视频帧插值，为视频生成应用提供了更大的灵活性。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息直接集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致在内容保持和艺术风格化方面效果不佳。

Method: 提出多级动态风格迁移框架，包括：1）多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示；2）动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成；3）多级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计NeRF流程和引入创新模块，显著提升了3D风格迁移的性能，支持使用3D风格参考进行全视角风格迁移。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

*Yunbo Xu,Xuesong Zhang,Jia Li,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于共识的在线特征增强策略（COFA），通过交替使用前景和背景特征来提升视觉语言导航（VLN）的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉语言导航中，前景区域提供语义线索，背景区域包含空间连接信息，但这两者在视觉观察中的重要性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 首先利用语义增强的地标识别来分离前景和背景作为候选增强特征，然后通过共识驱动的在线增强策略，让智能体根据不同的指令和导航位置来整合两阶段投票结果以确定特征偏好。

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上的实验表明，这种在线前景-背景特征增强方法提升了基线的泛化能力，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过交替使用前景和背景特征，并结合共识驱动的在线增强策略，可以有效提升视觉语言导航任务的泛化性能。

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RCOR方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分，实现对象中心和上下文感知建模的解耦，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合，在保持上下文信息的同时提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了在真实世界部署中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来改进泛化，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦对象中心和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在域内和域外背景数据集上的性能，即使在复杂场景如ImageNet-1k中也能实现定位先于识别。

Conclusion: RCOR是首个同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的方法，无需牺牲任何一方，证明了在复杂场景中定位先于识别是可行的。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练在一步生成中很关键，但GAN训练难以正确收敛且存在模式崩溃问题。研究发现条件判别器中的冗余捷径阻碍了有意义的知识提取。

Method: 采用无条件判别器(UCD)，强制判别器提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，无需条件注入。这种方法与标准GAN理论兼容，可以即插即用。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，表现出显著的性能提升和高效率。

Conclusion: UCD通过促进GAN训练中的纳什均衡，有效解决了模式崩溃问题，为一步生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Motivation: 现有基于CNN和Transformer的深度伪造检测方法在建模复杂非线性伪造伪影方面仍有改进空间，需要更有效的检测算法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了几何先验和网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux方法成功揭示了现有概念擦除技术在整流流框架中的局限性，为未来安全研究提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

semantically consistent tagging. OTTER consistently outperforms competitive
baselines on two benchmark datasets: it achieves an overall F1 score of 0.81 on
Otter and 0.75 on Favorite, surpassing the next-best results by margins of 0.10
and 0.02, respectively. OTTER attains near-perfect performance on open-set

Motivation: 薄云缺乏明显特征和训练样本质量低限制了深度学习云检测方法的准确性，需要进一步改进。

Method: 使用渐进训练框架训练多尺度场景级云检测网络，结合多尺度概率图和云厚度图获取像素级云概率图，通过自适应阈值和距离加权优化生成二值云掩码。

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下具有优越性和潜力，显著提升了云检测精度。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Align Your Tangent (AYT)的新方法，通过引入流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数来加速一致性模型(CMs)的训练，解决CM训练中切线振荡问题，显著提升训练效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一致性模型(CMs)虽然能实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批量大小才能获得有竞争力的样本质量。研究发现CM训练收敛时切线方向存在振荡问题，平行于数据流形而非指向流形，这阻碍了训练效率。

Method: 提出了流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数，该损失能够提供与流形对齐的切线方向，使更新方向指向数据流形。该方法称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)，通过缓解切线振荡来加速CM训练。

Result: AYT方法能够将CM训练加速数个数量级，甚至在学习感知图像块相似度(LPIPS)指标上表现更优。此外，该方法支持使用极小的批量大小进行训练，且不会损害样本质量。

Conclusion: 通过引入流形对齐的切线方向，AYT方法有效解决了CM训练中的振荡问题，大幅提升了训练效率和样本质量，为快速高质量生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有生成AI方法忽略了图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，且将潜在空间的概率分布视为无趣或预定义的。本文旨在统一几何和概率视角。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影机制，构建了确定性模型MPPM，在表示空间和潜在空间中操作。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

Motivation: 标准学习方法使用one-hot编码，计算复杂度和内存需求随类别数线性增长。本文旨在通过二进制编码方法将这些需求降低到对数级别。

Method: 研究了一系列二进制编码方法，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOC)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配和标签嵌入树。

Result: 与one-hot编码(DSC=82.4)相比，二进制分割方法的性能下降，DSC范围在39.3到73.8之间。

Conclusion: 虽然二进制编码在效率上有所改进，但在达到最先进分割质量方面面临挑战，希望这项研究能启发未来对大型多类分割任务的紧凑编码策略的研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件-图像知识蒸馏的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过CLIP教师模型指导事件学生模型学习视觉表示，并结合SNN和CNN混合网络解决事件数据分割中的信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应和抗运动模糊的优势，但缺乏纹理和颜色信息，难以实现开放词汇检测。现有方法局限于预定义类别，无法泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用CLIP教师模型处理图像帧，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导事件学生模型学习视觉表示；设计SNN-CNN混合框架，SNN自适应确定事件分割时机，CNN处理提取的特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，同时保留关键的时间信息。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功弥合了图像和事件流之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据上的开放词汇目标检测，解决了现有方法泛化能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出ProtoMask模型，利用图像分割基础模型改进原型案例推理方法的可解释性，通过将显著图计算限制在预定义的语义图像块中来提高可视化真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于原型案例推理的XAI方法通常依赖后处理显著图技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑。作者旨在通过图像分割模型改进嵌入空间到输入空间的映射真实性。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，利用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，构建ProtoMask模型架构。每个掩码在模型中作为独立输入，将显著图计算限制在语义图像块内。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，ProtoMask模型具有竞争性的性能表现和独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割技术，有效提高了原型案例推理方法的可解释性真实性和可靠性，为XAI领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个基于推理的概念瓶颈模型框架，通过图变换器和混合专家模块增强概念关系建模，在多数据集上实现了更高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，忽略了概念间的结构化关系，无法适应复杂的概念推理模式。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模概念关系，集成图变换器捕捉多层次依赖，并用混合专家模块替代前馈层以动态分配推理任务。

Result: MoE-SGT在多个数据集上比其他概念瓶颈网络实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过建模概念间的结构化关系并利用动态专家选择机制，MoE-SGT显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于MLLM内在不确定性的训练免费框架，通过响应熵值评估候选视觉输入，使模型能自主关注最显著数据，在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位等任务中达到与专业微调方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务中存在困难，现有方法依赖复杂、任务特定的微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为主动引导信号，通过响应熵值对候选视觉输入进行评分，使模型能自主聚焦于最相关的视觉信息。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务中，使现成的MLLM达到了与专业微调方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强多模态细粒度性能的强大通用策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督深度学习的运动校正方法，用于心脏磁共振灌注成像，替代传统迭代配准方法，显著提高了处理速度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习管道，通过一次性估计替代迭代配准，采用三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析来减少对比度相关影响，对齐灌注序列和辅助图像。

Result: 深度学习方法显著改善了时间-强度曲线的时间平滑性，心肌对齐性能与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图显示运动减少，处理时间减少了15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道实现了快速、鲁棒的运动校正，提高了动态和辅助图像的准确性，在多厂商数据上训练使其能够跨序列泛化，有助于推动定量灌注成像的临床应用。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用仅12个EEG通道和视觉变换器模型，在情绪预测任务中达到91.57%的准确率，显著降低了传统32通道EEG设备的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性问题，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。低成本EEG设备提供更直接、无偏的数据源，但需要验证其简化测量能力是否足够准确。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集中的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器（ViT）模型进行情绪分类。

Result: 仅使用12个测量点（通道）就能在4象限（高/低唤醒度和效价）情绪预测中达到91.57%的准确率，与使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%相比表现优异。

Conclusion: 显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得高准确率，证明了低成本EEG设备在情绪预测任务中的可行性，为心理健康、人机交互和情感计算应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决极端盲图像恢复(EBIR)问题的新框架，通过将极度低质量(ELQ)到高质量(HQ)的恢复过程分解为两步：首先将ELQ图像投影到中间低质量(LQ)流形，然后使用现成的BIR模型恢复为HQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的盲图像恢复方法在处理极端退化情况时效果不佳，因为直接从ELQ到HQ的映射存在巨大的域差距，容易产生不自然的伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论，将图像恢复视为信息瓶颈问题，设计了包含低质量重建项和高质量先验匹配项的损失函数来训练投影器。支持推理时提示精炼和即插即用的现有模型增强。

Result: 在严重退化情况下的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够稳定训练并提升恢复质量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解恢复过程解决了EBIR问题，为现有图像恢复模型提供了无需微调的增强能力，在极端退化情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的自动缺陷检测系统，使用U-Net架构在OCT图像上实现陶瓷制造中的内部缺陷检测，达到0.979 Dice Score的高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在陶瓷制造中，无损检测对于确保组件质量而不损害其完整性至关重要。光学相干断层扫描(OCT)能够提供高分辨率内部成像，但需要自动化方法来检测孔隙、分层或夹杂物等缺陷。

Method: 开发基于U-Net架构的神经网络，使用手动分割标注的OCT图像进行训练，评估多种实验配置以提升性能，并应用后处理技术进行定量和定性评估。

Result: 系统表现出0.979 Dice Score的准确行为，优于可比研究，每体积18.98秒的推理时间支持其在检测夹杂物方面的可行性。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了更高效、可靠和自动化的质量控制，为陶瓷制造中的无损检测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

TL;DR: 提出了MULTI-TAP多目标任务感知预测器，用于评估图像-文本对齐度，能同时进行多目标和单目标评分，在性能和效率上优于现有方法，并发布了新的数据集EYE4ALL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像-文本对齐评估缺乏全面基准，现有预测器在人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性方面存在不足，特别是在存在多个有效描述的现实场景中。

Method: 使用在预训练大型视觉语言模型隐藏状态上训练的轻量级岭回归层构建MULTI-TAP，能产生细粒度的多目标评分和单一总体评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在不同LVLM架构上表现稳健，性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o基预测器G-VEval相当但模型更小(7-8B)，在多目标基准和新数据集EYE4ALL上优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为可靠视觉语言应用开发提供了强大的图像-文本对齐评估工具，新数据集EYE4ALL为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础，特别是考虑了盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成方法主要关注短片段，且仅与单一参考对比，忽略了音频描述写作的主观性本质。需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析两部独立音频描述轨道，量化描述的主观性；提出ADQA基准测试，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解问题，评估长视频片段的音频描述质量。

Result: 发现当前音频描述生成方法在帮助盲人和低视力用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面，远落后于人工创作的音频描述。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的音频描述生成方法，并提出了公共排行榜用于基准测试，为未来工作提供了建议。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用深度神经网络的特征表示来生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这限制了在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 使用深度神经网络的特征映射，将其添加到干净图像中来破坏目标模型的分类性能，实现单次查询攻击。

Result: ZQBA能够将对抗样本迁移到不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet），在单次查询下比现有方法更有效，同时保持扰动不可感知。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了深度神经网络在实际应用中的脆弱性，提供了一种高效的黑盒攻击方案。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法在概念瓶颈模型中实现了更好的不确定性传播和可解释性，同时提升了分类性能。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaLogic评估框架，用于检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的缺陷，通过生成语法不同但语义相同的提示词对来识别模型的对齐失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在处理语义等效但语法不同的提示词时，经常产生不一致的图像，暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，无需依赖真实图像作为基准。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估发现，Flux.dev和DALLE-3分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，揭示了模型在逻辑理解方面的系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需真实基准的评估方法，能有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题，有助于模型调试和改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen通过物理感知轨迹引导有效提升了视频生成的物理一致性。

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义先前的伪离散方法，通过在one-hot空间中直接保留核心扩散特性，建立判别式学习和生成式学习之间的桥梁。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间建立联系。

Result: 在分类任务上优于基线方法，并在图像描述生成任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力。

Conclusion: ADD框架通过协调机制在one-hot空间中实现了真正的离散扩散，验证了各组件带来的可测量增益。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索。为了将短语定位扩展到立体领域，需要专门的数据集来支持语义和几何的联合推理。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo技术从现有单视图数据生成准确的右视图图像，构建包含立体图像对、对齐分割掩码和短语标注的PhraseStereo数据集。

Result: 成功创建了PhraseStereo数据集，为立体视觉中的短语-区域分割提供了首个基准，支持多模态学习利用深度线索进行更精确和上下文感知的定位。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉领域的研究奠定了基础，将促进能够联合推理语义和几何的模型发展，该数据集将在论文接受后公开发布。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NSARM框架，结合自回归模型和两阶段训练方法，在保持快速推理的同时提升真实图像超分辨率的鲁棒性和生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Real-ISR方法存在速度与质量权衡问题：基于扩散模型的方法质量高但速度慢，直接输入的方法速度快但质量低，且现有方法对输入图像质量变化鲁棒性差

Method: 基于视觉自回归模型的逐尺度预测策略，采用两阶段训练：先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端全模型微调

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中均优于现有Real-ISR方法，视觉结果更优，推理速度快，对输入图像质量变化具有更高鲁棒性

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现了优越的视觉质量和鲁棒性，同时保持快速推理速度

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次类别间的内在关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号。

Method: 提出了两种层次对比学习方法：基于高斯混合模型的G-HMLC和基于注意力机制的A-HMLC，显式建模类别间关系和层次间不平衡分布。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，在线性评估中实现了最先进的性能，比现有层次对比学习方法准确率提高了2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模层次间关系，实现了跨所有层次级别的细粒度聚类，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GSMamba，一种结合移位窗口自注意力和Mamba选择性扫描的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter Mamba机制有效处理时空依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RNN的视频超分辨率方法存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer虽然能建模全局上下文但复杂度高且不适合长序列。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的选择性状态空间模型，但单独使用难以捕捉细粒度空间依赖。

Method: 提出混合架构：使用移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合，结合Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时序传播。引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制，在Mamba传播前将特征向中心锚帧扭曲，传播后再散射回各帧，减少遮挡伪影并确保信息有效重分布。

Result: 该方法在视频超分辨率任务中表现出色，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，同时保持了高效的计算性能。

Conclusion: GSMamba通过结合自注意力和选择性状态空间模型的优势，为视频超分辨率提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案，特别适合处理长序列视频数据。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型通过解剖学知情的交叉注意力网络设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了青光眼分类性能，为OCT-based青光眼诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Motivation: 医学影像迁移学习中的源数据集选择通常依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化性和患者预后。研究旨在从人机交互视角理解实践者如何选择源数据集。

Method: 采用任务型调查方法，对机器学习从业者进行调研，从人机交互角度分析源数据集选择决策过程。

Result: 发现选择是任务依赖性的，受社区实践、数据集属性、计算相似性和感知相似性影响。相似性评级与预期性能并不总是一致，参与者常使用模糊术语。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和人机交互工具来明确这些启发式方法，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供实践洞见。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

TL;DR: 提出PAL-Net自动化深度学习流水线，用于在3D面部扫描上定位50个解剖学标志点，结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和注意力增强的补丁式点状CNN，在精度和计算成本间取得良好平衡。

Motivation: 3D面部扫描的手动解剖标志点标注耗时且依赖专业知识，限制了临床应用的自动化程度。现有深度学习方法多关注伪标志点或需要复杂输入表示。

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和初始标志点近似，使用注意力机制增强的补丁式点状CNN进行精确定位。

Result: 在214个标注扫描上达到3.686mm平均定位误差，在FaceScape数据集700个受试者上达到0.41mm点状误差和0.38mm距离误差，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAL-Net提供了轻量级、可扩展的高通量3D人体测量分析解决方案，有潜力支持临床工作流程并减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Conclusion: 基于新发现的向量平移特征对齐框架在跨分辨率行人重识别任务中表现出有效性和优越性。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR提出了一种自回归单步扩散范式，用于解决长视频超分辨率问题，实现了流式推理并充分利用预训练视频扩散先验，在质量和效率上均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临效率低下和扩展性差的问题，主要由于多步去噪的高成本和时序分解导致的伪影与不连续性。

Method: 1) 将预训练DiT适配为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉指导保持局部和全局一致性；2) 将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用块状像素监督和跨块分布匹配实现高效处理。

Result: 该方法在长视频超分辨率领域达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比现有方法如MGLD-VSR实现了高达58倍的加速。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，为无界长度视频提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，并建立了专门的长视频评估基准。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与主干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的映射图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的地图构建时间。本文旨在探索能否在保持竞争力的准确率下实现更快的定位速度。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些映射特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。结合图像检索技术实现快速定位。

Result: FastForward在最小地图准备时间下达到了最先进的准确率，并在包括大型室外环境在内的未见领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了通过单次前向传播实现快速视觉定位的可行性，为实时定位系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了序列生成中的错误累积问题，在共享序列预测框架下显著提升了视觉语言建模性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性引导的自适应扰动分布解决AR模型中CFG的指导衰减和过度指导问题，无需训练即可显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中面临分类器自由指导的两个关键问题：指导衰减（条件-无条件差距随解码快速消失）和过度指导（强条件扭曲视觉连贯性）。

Method: SoftCFG通过让每个生成的token贡献确定性加权的指导，确保信号跨步骤持续存在；引入步骤归一化来限制累积扰动，稳定长序列生成。

Result: 实验显示SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最先进的FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，可无缝集成到现有AR流程中，有效解决了CFG在AR模型中的应用挑战。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAM方法虽然能高亮空间区域，但缺乏对这些激活区域背后语义属性的理解，限制了在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述，并扩展为语义一致的特征通道分组。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过融合空间定位和语义描述，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富和可解释的解释方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在视频问答中虽然能处理1500+帧的长视频，但仅对应50秒的视频内容，存在信息损失问题。需要更高效的方法来压缩视频信息并保持问答性能。

Method: 使用多种时间池化方法（混合模糊、加权平均、指数和斜坡池化）构建1fps输入源，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B模型进行监督微调和直接偏好优化训练。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升到0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升到0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升到0.528，推理质量也显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下都保持了性能增益，显示了在时间证据总结方面的强鲁棒性，在TVQA上的零样本测试也观察到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor提供了全面、可解释的图像质量评估，在模型评估和偏好对齐方面都表现出色，为文本到图像模型发展提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Method: 将对抗训练引入高光谱领域，提出AT-RA方法，通过数据增强技术增加光谱信息多样性，并确保空间平滑性来保持和校正高光谱图像中的光谱语义信息。

Result: AT-RA方法将对抗鲁棒性提高了21.34%（针对AutoAttack）和18.78%（针对PGD-50），同时将良性准确率提升了2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据特有的挑战，显著提升了模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Result: 相比先前工作，该方法生成的人脸匿名化图像与原始人脸视觉相似度更低，同时保持高质量图像生成。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了安全、高质量的可逆人脸匿名化，为隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Motivation: 当前3D场景图构建方法在语义上受限于预定义的关系集，且在大环境中序列化容易超出LLM的上下文窗口。需要一种更通用、可扩展的场景表示方法。

Method: 使用分层图表示3D场景（楼层、房间、对象、功能元素），节点通过优化几何和视觉覆盖的关键帧增强多模态信息，利用VLM提取场景信息，采用分层RAG管道提取相关上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试（包括3D对象分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了其优越的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层图结构和关键帧优化，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，为复杂环境中的机器人推理和规划提供了更强大的表示能力。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动驾驶系统中应用日益增多，但幻觉问题限制了其在安全关键流程中的可靠性，需要一种能够校准模型输出的融合方法。

Method: 使用博弈论融合方法，学习每个模型在特定上下文条件下的可靠性，通过Shapley值更新信誉状态，结合上下文先验和协议保护的对数似然比，生成可校准的后验概率。

Result: 与最佳单模型相比，汉明距离减少23%，宏F1提高55%，微F1提高47%，证明该方法能有效提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了校准、可解释且鲁棒的决策支持组件，能够放大可靠模型间的共识，保留独特正确信号，并适应数据漂移。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，通过单张全景图像输入生成未来视频帧，并利用演化3D重建作为显式空间引导来增强视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类能够心理探索和重放先前体验的3D环境的能力启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 首先使用具有细粒度视图控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧，然后通过前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后基于演化3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提高了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性。

Conclusion: 演化3D记忆相比现有方法在视觉真实性和空间一致性方面有显著提升，代表了长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频编辑方法在多主体编辑时存在的多模态条件不足和掩码边界纠缠问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 通过提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，提供强大的多模态条件和精确的掩码序列，然后将获得的先验掩码序列输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型来合成编辑后的视频。

Result: 在新建的多主体基准MSVBench上的广泛实验验证，IMAGEdit持续超越最先进的方法，并与任何掩码驱动视频生成模型兼容，显著提升整体性能。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit通过强大的泛化能力解决了多主体视频编辑中的关键挑战，显著扩展了视频编辑的应用范围，且代码、模型和数据集均已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are
publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.

*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为直接令牌优化（DTO）的新型自包含遗忘学习方法，无需外部资源即可从大型语言模型中移除特定训练数据的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM遗忘学习方法依赖辅助语言模型、保留数据集甚至商业AI服务，这在实践中不切实际且可能引入额外隐私风险。

Method: 通过识别序列中的目标令牌（用于优化遗忘目标）和非目标令牌（用于保持模型效用），直接在令牌级别优化目标。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DTO在遗忘质量上比最新基线方法提升了高达16.8倍，同时保持了相当的模型效用水平。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效的自包含遗忘学习方法，无需外部资源即可实现高质量的遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性活动助手在日常生活和职业场景中具有广泛应用潜力，但相关系统开发仍不足。

Method: 使用多媒体返回工具进行训练免费的多模态推理，具备灵活的工具选择能力。

Result: 在ProMQA-Assembly数据集上提高了视觉语言模型（特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL）的性能，消融研究验证了多媒体返回工具和灵活工具选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了视频和多模态任务的图像思维范式，推动了程序性活动助手的开发。

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

Conclusion: DRBench为推进企业深度研究提供了关键路径，展示了不同AI代理在复杂企业任务中的表现差异。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

Motivation: 随着语言模型的广泛应用，需要更好地将个体用户特征融入模型。研究探讨语言模型是否能利用个人信念系统的某些方面来改进对齐效果。

Method: 开发PrimeX数据集，包含858名美国居民的民意调查数据、观点解释和Primal World Belief世界观调查，用于个性化语言模型。

Result: 研究显示信念解释和世界观信息对个性化语言模型具有价值，PrimeX数据集能为NLP和心理学研究社区提供额外信念信息。

Conclusion: PrimeX数据集中的额外信念信息能为NLP和心理学研究开辟新的研究途径，促进语言模型个性化对齐的进一步发展。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO是一个评估方法，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务，使用基于心理学的角色和稀疏偏好来评估LLM的个性化推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM开发将任务解决和偏好对齐视为独立挑战，但在面向人类的应用中，正确解决问题不足够，如果响应与用户需求不匹配。在即时场景中，由于冷启动或隐私限制，没有先前的用户交互历史，LLM需要识别未知的用户偏好，通过提问策略性地获取偏好值，然后相应调整推理过程和响应。

Method: 引入PREFDISCO评估方法，使用基于心理学的角色和稀疏偏好将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务。创建相同问题需要不同推理链的场景，根据用户背景（如专业知识和偏好）调整解释方法，同时保持事实准确性。

Result: 评估21个前沿模型在10个任务上显示，29.0%的朴素个性化尝试比通用响应的偏好对齐更差，但通用响应也无法有效服务个体用户需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发，而不是自然出现。PREFDISCO将个性化推理确立为可衡量的研究前沿，揭示了当前LLM交互能力的基本限制，为在教育、医疗和技术领域开发能够适应个体用户的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

Conclusion: 建立了统一的偏见缓解研究测试平台，解决了评估不一致问题，弥合了评估与现实使用场景的差距。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

Motivation: 现有自动翻译评估指标缺乏可解释性，需要开发结合准确性和透明度的新评估方法。

Method: 利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力，采用结构化提示模板进行系统化、逐步的翻译质量评估。

Result: 在系统级评估中，TASER在有无参考译文的情况下都达到了最高的软配对准确率；在段落级评估中，无参考变体在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面显示出可衡量的进步，将改进的准确性与跨语言对的透明评估相结合。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

Result: 实验表明，使用RAG的ELM在性能上持续优于非RAG基线，并突出了关键的ELM设计考虑因素

Conclusion: RAG能有效提升心电图-语言模型的性能，为领域提供了首个开源实现和系统评估

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 通过校准概率自动评分器来建模完整偏好分布，能够提高其在主观任务上的可靠性，同时保持客观任务的性能。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本生成任务上表现优异，但在文本分类特别是需要细微区分的修订分类任务上表现不足，且传统微调方法需要大量昂贵标注数据。

Method: 提出IR-Tuning框架，基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要LLM层进行参数高效微调，冻结冗余层以减少计算和内存开销。

Result: 实验表明IR-Tuning在多种文本修订任务上优于其他层式PEFT基线，具有快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和小数据集有效性等优势。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning为资源受限场景下的文本修订分类提供了一种高效解决方案，通过选择性层微调实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

Result: 发现现有指标在解释临床语义方面存在局限，包括无法区分临床显著错误、过度惩罚无害变异以及在不同错误严重程度级别上缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的元评估框架为构建更临床可靠的评估方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个多智能体LLM架构，用于安全运营中心的高风险警报分类，通过专业化智能体协作处理企业安全警报，显著减少误报并提高调查质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心每天面临数万条警报，只有少量是真实攻击，导致警报疲劳、威胁遗漏和分析师倦怠。传统检测管道脆弱且缺乏上下文，而单一LLM方法在处理嘈杂企业数据和透明度方面存在局限。

Method: 提出CORTEX多智能体LLM架构，包含行为分析智能体检查活动序列、证据收集智能体查询外部系统、推理智能体综合发现形成可审计决策。

Result: 在多样化企业场景中，CORTEX相比最先进的单智能体LLM显著减少误报并提高调查质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作方法比单一LLM方法更适合处理复杂的企业安全警报分类任务，提供了更好的透明度和准确性。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem是一种标记化程序记忆，通过将重复程序存储为紧凑可训练的嵌入来替代提示工程和微调，在保持骨干模型冻结的同时实现持续适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型过度依赖提示来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，这种方式效率低下、难以跨任务扩展且缺乏模块化重用机制。

Method: 引入TokMem，将重复程序存储为紧凑可训练的嵌入，每个记忆标记编码程序地址和控制信号，以恒定大小开销实现目标行为。

Result: 在1000个原子回忆任务和函数调用任务中，TokMem持续优于检索增强生成，避免了重复上下文开销，且使用更少参数。

Conclusion: TokMem为LLMs提供了可扩展和模块化的程序记忆替代方案，优于提示工程和微调方法。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一个专为代码LLM设计的即插即用压缩框架，通过双阶段压缩策略在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文剪枝技术如LLMLingua在通用文本上表现良好，但忽略了代码特定的结构和依赖关系，导致在编程任务中性能不佳。高API成本和生成延迟成为代码LLM处理长上下文的瓶颈。

Method: 采用双阶段压缩策略：1）粗粒度压缩，使用条件困惑度识别和排序函数级块，保留最相关函数；2）细粒度压缩，将保留函数按困惑度分段，在自适应token预算下选择最优子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在代码补全、摘要和问答等多个任务上的评估显示，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: 通过有效减小上下文大小同时保留关键信息，LongCodeZip使LLM能够更好地扩展到现实世界的大规模代码场景，提升了代码智能应用的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化大语言模型输出以适应用户偏好是活跃研究领域，但现有研究主要关注分类或排序任务，未充分探索评分预测这一需要语言和数学推理的回归任务。

Method: 通过三个数据集的综合实验，测试八个现成大语言模型在不同上下文信息下的评分预测性能，包括使用用户评论和生成假设评论等策略。

Result: 用户撰写的评论显著提高了LLMs的评分预测性能，效果与传统矩阵分解方法相当，为解决冷启动问题提供了有前景的方案。

Conclusion: 现成大语言模型在评分预测任务中表现出色，特别是当提供用户评论时，这为解决推荐系统中的冷启动问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Motivation: 当前基于上下文学习的代理LLM方法存在输入冗长和计算成本高的问题，而代理微调能够通过训练让模型内化程序性推理和领域知识。但现有研究主要关注通用领域，在专业微领域中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 使用JP1特定数据集（来自领域手册和LLM生成的推理轨迹）对LLM进行微调，推理时采用检索增强生成和上下文-答案提取器来提高信息相关性。

Result: 在JP1认证考试问题上，该方法相比基础模型实现了14%的性能提升，显著提高了决策准确性和搜索效率。

Conclusion: 代理微调在复杂微领域中具有显著潜力，能够有效提升领域特定推理能力，为专业领域的LLM应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Agent-ScanKit框架来探测多模态代理的记忆和推理能力，发现在GUI任务中机械记忆往往优于系统推理，大多数模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种策略提升多模态代理在图形用户界面中的自主交互能力，但在面对复杂或领域外任务时可靠性仍然有限，这引发了对现有多模态代理是否进行伪推理的根本质疑。

Method: 提出了Agent-ScanKit系统探测框架，包含三种正交探测范式：视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导，每种都设计用于量化记忆和推理的贡献，无需访问模型内部。

Result: 在5个公开可用的GUI基准测试中涉及18个多模态代理，结果表明机械记忆往往优于系统推理，大多数模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，表现出有限的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在现实场景中为多模态代理建立稳健推理模型的必要性，为开发可靠的多模态代理提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

TL;DR: MOSS-Speech是一个真正的语音到语音大语言模型，无需文本中间层直接理解和生成语音，通过模态分层架构和冻结预训练策略，在保持文本LLM推理能力的同时增加原生语音能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音对话系统使用级联流水线会丢弃副语言线索并限制表达性，现有端到端方法虽然减少延迟但仍依赖文本中间层，造成根本性瓶颈。

Method: 结合模态分层架构和冻结预训练策略，在预训练文本LLM基础上添加原生语音能力，保持原有推理和知识。

Result: 模型在语音问答任务上达到最先进水平，在语音到语音性能上与现有文本引导系统相当，同时保持有竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本引导和直接语音生成之间的差距，为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval是一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于自动生成多模态文档理解和网页交互任务，以全面评估智能体在动态环境中的推理、协作和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态LLM驱动的智能体在自主性和泛化能力上的进步，基于静态数据集的评估已无法充分评估其在动态环境和多样化任务中的真实能力。现有方法主要针对LLM训练和评估，无法直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的智能体任务。

Method: 使用从多源外部数据构建的知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务。采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道来保证生成任务的质量和可执行性。

Result: 构建了Graph2Eval-Bench数据集，包含1,319个涵盖文档理解和网页交互场景的任务。实验表明Graph2Eval能有效生成区分智能体和模型性能的任务，揭示不同设置下推理、协作和网页交互能力的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为智能体评估提供了新视角，能够全面评估多种智能体类型（单智能体、多智能体、网页智能体）的推理、协作和交互能力，填补了现有评估方法的空白。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了CopyPasteLLM，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练来解决RAG中的上下文忠实性问题。研究发现高复制度能减少幻觉，仅需365个训练样本就能在多个数据集上显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中LLM可能不信任提供的上下文，导致幻觉问题，影响可靠性。研究发现响应复制度与上下文不忠实幻觉呈负相关。

Method: 设计三种提示方法增强复制度，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练获得CopyPasteLLM，使用自动管道将生成响应转换为高复制偏好数据。

Result: 在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上表现最佳，FaithEval准确率比最佳基线提升12.2%到24.5%，仅需365个训练样本（基线的1/50）。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖而非外部知识来提升上下文忠实性，证明了高复制度在控制幻觉方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for
complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated
improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,

multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of
system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and

Method: 提出了一个可扩展的管道，包括媒体检索的鲁棒组件和两阶段对齐算法，用于处理非逐字转录和长音频。将该流程应用于22个欧洲议会的录音。

Result: 提取了超过61k小时的对齐语音片段，19种语言超过1k小时，22种语言超过500小时的高质量语音数据。在现有ASR模型上微调后，词错误率平均降低41.8%。

Conclusion: 该管道能够有效构建大规模多语言语音数据集，显著提升语音识别性能，为解决多语言语音数据不足问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型语言模型的后训练阶段，传统的负对数似然目标在模型能力不同的情况下表现不一，提出了基于模型能力连续体的目标选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调通常使用负对数似然作为训练目标，但在后训练阶段可能不是最优选择，因为模型已经具备任务相关的先验知识，且监督信号可能较长且嘈杂。

Method: 研究了一类基于概率的目标函数家族，通过7个模型主干、14个基准测试和3个领域的综合实验，分析了不同目标在不同模型能力条件下的表现。

Result: 发现模型能力连续体是决定目标函数效果的关键维度：在模型能力强的一端，倾向于先验的目标（如$-p$, $-p^{10}$）优于NLL；在模型能力弱的一端，NLL占优；中间区域则没有单一优势目标。

Conclusion: 应根据模型能力选择适当的训练目标，理论分析阐明了不同目标在能力连续体上的权衡关系，为后训练阶段的目标选择提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further

### [123] [GUI-KV: Efficient GUI Agents via KV Cache with Spatio-Temporal Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00536)
*Kung-Hsiang Huang,Haoyi Qiu,Yutong Dai,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI-KV是一种无需重新训练的KV缓存压缩方法，专门针对GUI代理设计，通过空间显著性和时间冗余评分技术，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理处理高分辨率截图和长时程任务时面临效率挑战，现有缓存压缩方法未能充分利用GUI的空间和时间冗余特性。

Method: 结合空间显著性引导（增强注意力分数）和时间冗余评分（投影历史帧到当前帧子空间），采用统一的预算分配策略压缩KV缓存。

Result: 在标准GUI代理基准测试中，GUI-KV优于现有压缩方法，在AgentNetBench上减少38.9%解码FLOPs同时提高4.1%步骤准确率。

Conclusion: 利用GUI特定的冗余特性可以实现高效可靠的代理性能，简单的统一预算分配策略优于复杂的层变化方案。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

*Minjae Oh,Sangjun Song,Seungkyu Lee,Sungmin Jo,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ThinkBrake方法来解决小推理模型在工具使用中的过度思考问题，通过监控句子边界处的概率差异来提前终止推理，在保持或提高准确率的同时显著减少推理token数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小推理模型在工具使用中存在过度思考问题：它们已经达到正确的工具参数配置，但继续推理并用错误的最终调用覆盖它。这种问题在工具推理领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出ThinkBrake训练无关的解码启发式方法，在句子边界处监控</think>与当前top token之间的对数概率差异，当这个差异变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard的三个测试集上，ThinkBrake保持或提高了准确率，同时减少了高达25%的token数量，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: ThinkBrake有效解决了小推理模型的过度思考问题，在工具推理任务中实现了更好的效率-准确率平衡。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CHIME中文网络梗解释数据集，评估大语言模型对网络梗的理解能力。结果显示LLMs能解释部分梗的含义，但在文化语言细微差别和起源追溯方面表现不佳，性能显著低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正理解网络上快速传播的病毒性内容——网络梗，特别是中文网络梗。

Method: 构建CHIME中文网络梗数据集，包含梗的含义、起源、例句等信息。设计两个评估任务：1)解释梗的含义、起源和生成例句；2)在上下文句子中选择合适的梗填空。

Result: LLMs能解释部分梗的含义，但对文化和语言细微差别的梗类型表现显著下降，且难以准确提供梗的起源。在选择题任务中表现低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对网络梗的理解能力有限，特别是在文化背景和起源追溯方面。CHIME数据集将促进计算梗理解研究的未来发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

TL;DR: ReSeek是一个用于训练搜索代理的自我纠正框架，通过引入JUDGE动作和密集的过程奖励函数，使代理能够在搜索过程中动态识别和纠正错误路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的搜索代理方法依赖稀疏或基于规则的奖励，容易导致代理陷入次优或错误的推理路径而无法恢复。

Method: 提出ReSeek框架，包含自我纠正机制（JUDGE动作）和密集的过程奖励函数（正确性奖励和效用奖励），并使用新的基准数据集FictionalHot。

Result: 实验表明，使用ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSeek框架通过自我纠正机制和密集奖励设计，有效提升了搜索代理的性能和鲁棒性，解决了现有方法中路径错误无法恢复的问题。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

<details>

Motivation: 现有CoT实现（如上下文学习和微调）成本高且效率低，需要开发更经济高效的推理增强方法。

Method: 引入CoT Vectors作为任务通用的多步推理知识紧凑表示，提出可学习的CoT Vectors在教师-学生框架下优化，解决层间不稳定性问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的评估显示，CoT Vectors不仅优于现有基线方法，而且性能与参数高效微调方法相当，同时需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: CoT Vectors不仅提供了有效的推理增强方法，还揭示了LLMs中多步推理的功能组织机制，为理解模型推理过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了语言识别研究，还为语码转换语音技术建立了基础框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie作为那加兰邦的主要藏缅语系语言，是一种低资源语言，目前尚无音节划分相关研究。音节划分是NLP中的重要任务，对形态分析、词性标注等应用至关重要。

Method: 创建了10,120个音节化Tenyidie词汇数据集，应用了LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和编码器-解码器等多种深度学习架构，数据集按80:10:10比例划分为训练集、验证集和测试集。

Result: 在测试集上，BLSTM模型取得了99.21%的最高准确率，表明深度学习模型在Tenyidie语言音节划分任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Tenyidie语言创建了首个音节划分数据集和模型，为后续的形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等NLP应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代文本生成任务存在用户标注噪声、标准不一致以及多模态大模型对上下文信息不敏感的问题，传统监督微调依赖准确标注但用户生成的替代文本往往存在缺陷

Method: 提出多维度跨模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，通过单维度、配对维度和多维度偏好优化，覆盖文本、视觉和跨模态因素，无需精确标注即可学习识别更好的选项

Result: 实验结果表明MCM-DPO方法在替代文本生成任务上持续优于DPO和SFT方法，建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: MCM-DPO方法有效解决了替代文本生成中的标注质量问题，构建的两个高质量数据集TAlt和PAlt为后续研究提供了支持

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用大语言模型自动生成易读文本的方法，提出了多任务学习框架，结合检索增强生成和参数高效微调，在Mistral-7B和LLaMA-3-8B模型上验证了多任务设置优于单任务基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化复杂文本对于确保信息公平获取至关重要，特别是对认知障碍人群。易读倡议提供了使内容对神经多样性人群可访问的框架，但手动创建此类文本耗时且资源密集。

Method: 提出多任务学习方法，联合训练文本摘要、文本简化和易读文本生成任务。探索了两种策略：用于上下文学习的多任务检索增强生成(RAG)，以及用于参数高效微调的MTL-LoRA。

Result: 基于新构建的高质量数据集ETR-fr，实验表明多任务设置在所有配置中都优于单任务基线。RAG策略在域外设置中实现了泛化，而MTL-LoRA在域内配置中优于所有学习策略。

Conclusion: 多任务学习框架有效提升了易读文本的自动生成能力，RAG和MTL-LoRA策略在不同场景下各有优势，为大语言模型在文本简化领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Conclusion: AI驱动的易读文本生成为解决认知障碍人群的可访问性问题提供了可扩展的解决方案，PLMs在性能上与LLMs相当且具有更好的适应性。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准主要关注检索和理解任务，缺乏专门针对多步推理的数据集，特别是在开放式的法律推理领域。

Method: 基于13K+沙特商业法庭案例构建数据集，定义包括判决预测、推理链补全和相关法规识别等任务，并对阿拉伯语LLMs进行基准测试和指令微调。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集填补了阿拉伯语法律推理基准的空白，证明了其在提升LLMs法律推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言法罗语的LLM适配问题，探索从相关语言迁移学习的最佳策略。

Method: 从英语模型开始，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练（单独或合并），然后对法罗语进行微调，比较全参数微调和LoRA方法，使用新构建的最小对基准和人类评估。

Result: 相关语言迁移至关重要，但最佳源语言因任务而异：冰岛语提高语言准确性，丹麦语增强理解能力；LoRA改善语言可接受性，全参数微调产生更强的理解性能。

Conclusion: 语言适配策略应任务特定：源语言选择和微调方法都需要根据具体目标进行优化。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Method: 提出噪声合成框架和新指标，使用Qwen系列模型（包括标准LLM和大推理模型LRM）在高中低资源语言对上评估习语翻译性能。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下退化更严重，LRM在纠错方面无改进且更易受噪声影响，注意力从源习语转向噪声内容，置信度增加但准确性下降。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限性，需要自验证集成机制，训练无关和微调策略可提高鲁棒性但会牺牲干净环境下的性能，存在基本权衡。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

Method: 创建包含人类验证的管理场景，每个场景都要求在实用但有害的行动与安全但操作性能较差的行动之间做出选择，并设置平行对照组来测量模型的实用主义倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全-实用权衡方面表现不佳：许多模型为推进操作目标而选择有害选项，而其他模型则过度安全且无效。模型能够准确感知危害，但存在优先级排序问题。

Conclusion: ManagerBench是评估智能体行为核心组件的挑战性基准：当操作目标与对齐价值激励冲突行动时做出安全选择的能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，解决搜索增强LLM在多跳推理中的可靠性问题，通过识别、擦除和重新生成错误推理步骤来提高推理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索增强大语言模型在复杂多跳推理中可靠性有限，主要面临三个挑战：分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误，任一阶段的失败都会导致最终答案错误。

Method: 提出可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，明确识别错误推理步骤，擦除这些步骤并重新生成推理，防止错误逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 使用ERL训练的模型在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle数据集上取得显著提升，3B模型比之前SOTA提升8.48% EM和11.56% F1，7B模型提升5.38% EM和7.22% F1。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为LLM中的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluGuard是一个40亿参数的小型推理模型，专门用于缓解检索增强生成(RAG)中的幻觉问题，通过分类文档-声明对并提供基于证据的论证，在保持较小模型规模的同时达到与更大模型相当的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在NLP任务中表现出色，但幻觉问题限制了其在现实应用中的可信度，需要开发专门针对RAG场景的幻觉检测解决方案。

Method: 结合领域无关的合成数据集、合成的基础和幻觉声明，以及使用几率比偏好优化的偏好微调方法，将大模型推理能力蒸馏到小规模骨干网络中。

Result: 在RAGTruth子集上达到84.0%的平衡准确率，与MiniCheck(7B)和Granite Guardian 3.3(8B)相当但参数减半；在整个基准测试中达到75.7%平衡准确率，与GPT-4o(75.9%)相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard证明了通过精心设计的数据合成和偏好优化，可以在较小模型规模下实现与大模型相当的幻觉检测性能，为构建可信的RAG系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet是一个用于检测AI生成学术文本的结构感知框架，通过结合分段条件风格建模和多层次对比学习，实现精确的跨度级检测和可靠的置信度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在科学写作中的快速应用，引发了关于作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的严重担忧。现有检测方法主要依赖文档级分类或表面统计线索，但忽视了细粒度跨度定位，校准能力弱，且难以跨学科和生成器泛化。

Method: 结合分段条件风格建模与多层次对比学习来捕捉细微的人类-AI差异，同时减轻主题依赖性；集成BIO-CRF序列标注与基于指针的边界解码和置信度校准，实现精确的跨度级检测和可靠的概率估计。

Result: 在包含10万个标注样本的新构建跨学科数据集上，Sci-SpanDet实现了最先进的性能：AI-F1为80.17，AUROC为92.63，Span-F1为74.36。在对抗性重写下表现出强韧性，在IMRaD章节和不同学科间保持平衡的准确率。

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet显著超越了现有基线方法，为学术文档中AI生成文本检测提供了有效的解决方案，并将公开发布数据集和源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RAG在专家级物理推理（如解决奥林匹克物理问题）中的潜力，受学生通过复习过往题目准备竞赛的启发。

Method: 引入PhoPile多模态数据集，包含图表和方程；使用多种检索器对LLM和LMM进行RAG增强基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，结合物理语料库的检索能提升模型性能，但也揭示了检索增强物理推理面临的挑战。

Conclusion: RAG在提升物理推理方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

TL;DR: Fusion-of-N (FusioN) 方法通过LLM法官合成多个样本中最具信息量的元素，相比传统的Best-of-N选择方法，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Best-of-N方法只选择单一最佳样本，丢弃了其他样本中的有用信息。本文探索协作方法，让所有候选样本都能为最终生成做出贡献。

Method: 提出Fusion-of-N方法，使用通用LLM法官将每个样本中最具信息量的元素合成为单一最终答案。在测试时扩展和合成数据生成两种设置下进行评估。

Result: 在11种语言、3个不同任务和不同模型规模上的广泛基准测试中，FusioN始终优于BoN，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成的下游收益方面表现出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 应该从单一质量度量转向接受LLM生成的多面性，通过整合多样优势来解锁潜在能力，实现仅靠选择无法达到的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

Motivation: 分析LLMs在处理非标准英语方言时的性能下降问题，特别是识别导致性能下降的具体语法规则。

Method: 将标准美式英语问题转换为非标准方言变体，在多选题任务上测试LLM性能，并分析不同语法规则的影响。

Result: 非标准英语问题导致准确率下降高达20%，三个特定语法规则（存在性it、零系词、y'all）可以解释多数方言中的性能下降。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究关注针对个别高影响力语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的文本往往过于通用，结构多样性不足，限制了个性化表达。扩散模型为超越自回归范式提供了新机会。

Method: 采用级联框架先生成语法指导再进行条件文本生成，并推广到非级联架构以更好地对齐结构和内容。通过共享表示机制实现细粒度个性化。

Result: 在多个任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 该模型能够更好地捕捉风格化句子构建的词汇和结构特征，支持忠实风格生成和可泛化的零样本推理。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Result: 发现该领域对更严谨的因果评估需求日益增长，揭示了当前技术现状和关键挑战。

Conclusion: 通过概述最新进展和识别关键挑战，为未来研究提供了使模型更加透明的路线图。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

Motivation: 传统基于规则的DST方法在开放域和多轮聊天机器人中效率不足，无法提供复杂对话中类似人类的适应性和连贯性体验。

Method: 使用BERT进行槽位填充和意图检测，XGBoost进行意图验证，GPT进行DST，在线代理进行实时答案生成的混合模型。

Result: 在波斯语聊天机器人中，相比现有方法显著提高了准确性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 混合方法能有效提升DST能力，为更定制化、适应性更强、更类似人类的对话AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

TL;DR: 这篇系统文献综述分析了2020-2025年间非洲低资源语言自动语音识别(ASR)的研究现状，发现尽管ASR技术全球进展显著，但非洲语言仍严重缺乏代表性，存在数据集稀缺、模型训练困难、评估方法不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲拥有2000多种语言，但低资源语言的ASR研究严重不足，这阻碍了非洲大陆的数字包容性发展。研究旨在系统梳理非洲语言ASR的研究现状、挑战和未来方向。

Method: 采用PRISMA 2020方法，检索DBLP、ACM Digital Library、Google Scholar、Semantic Scholar和arXiv等数据库，筛选2020年1月至2025年7月间发表的71篇相关研究，涵盖74个数据集和111种语言。

Result: 发现仅有不到15%的研究提供可复现材料，数据集许可不明确。自监督学习和迁移学习技术有前景，但受限于预训练数据不足、方言覆盖不充分等问题。大多数研究使用词错误率(WER)，很少使用字符错误率(CER)或变音符号错误率(DER)等语言学指标。

Conclusion: 非洲语言ASR发展面临数据集可用性、标注质量、许可不确定性和基准测试有限等挑战。未来可持续发展需要利益相关者合作、创建伦理平衡的数据集、采用轻量级建模技术和积极基准测试。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Motivation: 大型语言模型评估在英语中有效，但在非英语环境中表现不佳，需要研究有效的多语言训练策略来构建高质量奖励模型。

Method: 提出了mR3模型，通过综合研究数据和课程选择策略，包括整合目标语言推理数据集，训练多语言奖励推理模型。

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

TL;DR: MASH是一个通过选择性求助训练LLM学会放弃回答的训练框架，使用强化学习惩罚外部搜索同时奖励准确回答，使搜索工具使用成为放弃回答的代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM无法可靠识别自身知识边界，经常对边界外问题产生幻觉回答，而人类能识别自身局限并寻求外部帮助或放弃回答。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过按次搜索付费的奖励机制，训练LLM在需要外部知识时使用搜索工具，否则直接回答。

Result: 在三个知识密集型QA数据集上，MASH显著优于先前的高效搜索方法，在多跳数据集上答案准确率提升7.6%，并能有效区分可回答/不可回答问题。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效对齐了搜索工具使用与参数知识，无需预先确定知识边界即可实现放弃回答决策，展示了与专门放弃方法类似的行为。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

Conclusion: 提出了基于微调的防御方法，能够有效缓解预训练编码器中毒带来的威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了社会福祉函数基准测试，评估大型语言模型在资源分配中的表现，发现大多数模型具有强烈的功利主义倾向，优先考虑群体效率而非公平分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地被用于影响人类福祉的高风险决策，需要评估这些模型在分配稀缺社会资源时的原则和价值观。

Method: 引入社会福祉函数基准测试，这是一个动态模拟环境，让LLM作为主权分配者，将任务分配给异质化的接收者群体，在集体效率和分配公平之间创造持久权衡。

Result: 评估了20个最先进的LLM，发现：模型的一般对话能力与分配技能相关性差；大多数模型表现出强烈的功利主义倾向；分配策略容易受到输出长度限制和社会影响框架的干扰。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为社会决策者存在风险，需要专门的基准测试和针对性的对齐方法来实现AI治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

TL;DR: 提出GRAD方法，通过训练LLM生成针对特定输入的简洁演示，在预算限制下优于传统RAG方法，并在数学推理和STEM问题上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖静态数据库，缺乏适应性且可能提供不相关的演示，限制了LLM的性能表现。

Method: 训练LLM模型生成输入特定的简洁演示，提供比传统RAG更好的上下文支持，在令牌数量限制下工作。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B上，GRAD在数学推理和STEM问题上持续优于强基线，并展现出对物理、化学、计算机科学等OOD领域的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRAD引入了一个可扩展的演示生成器模型，为资源受限环境下的动态少样本学习范式迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文识别了后训练对齐导致LLM多样性下降的根本原因——偏好数据中的典型性偏见，并提出了一种无需训练的提示策略Verbalized Sampling来规避模式崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练对齐经常减少LLM的多样性，导致模式崩溃现象。与以往研究归因于算法限制不同，本文发现了一个根本性的数据层面驱动因素：偏好数据中的典型性偏见。

Method: 提出了Verbalized Sampling（VS）策略，通过提示模型对一组回答进行概率分布的口头化（例如“生成5个关于咖啡的笑话及其对应概率”）。这是一种简单、无需训练的提示方法。

Result: 综合实验表明，VS在创意写作（诗歌、故事、笑话）、对话模拟、开放式问答和合成数据生成方面显著提高了性能，同时不牺牲事实准确性和安全性。在创意写作中，VS将多样性提高了1.6-2.1倍。

Conclusion: 本研究为模式崩溃提供了新的数据中心视角，并提供了一个实用的推理时补救措施，有助于释放预训练生成模型的多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

TL;DR: 本文提出SPHERE方法，通过保持神经元权重在超球面上的均匀分布来稳定连续模型编辑过程，防止灾难性遗忘，同时保持编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要持续更新以保持与现实世界知识同步，但连续编辑会导致表示不稳定和灾难性遗忘。本文旨在理解和减轻连续编辑引起的性能退化。

Method: 使用超球面能量(HE)量化编辑过程中的神经元均匀性，提出SPHERE方法：识别预训练权重矩阵的主要超球面方向互补的稀疏空间，并将新知识投影到该空间，减少对主要方向的扰动。

Result: 在LLaMA3(8B)和Qwen2.5(7B)上的实验表明，SPHERE在编辑能力上平均优于最佳基线16.41%，同时最忠实地保持模型的一般性能。

Conclusion: SPHERE提供了一条可靠的大规模知识编辑的规范化路径，通过稳定神经元权重分布来平衡知识保留和更新能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

Motivation: 开发高效的水下推进系统，通过优化波动游泳轮廓来提高推进效率，为自主水下航行器和仿生运动领域提供设计指导。

Method: 使用变形设计方法将身体变形表示为五个基线仿生轮廓的线性组合，结合贝叶斯优化策略，采用任意拉格朗日-欧拉方法模拟二维波动游泳者的非定常流动。

Conclusion: 基于变形的参数化设计结合代理辅助优化，为发现能量高效游泳步态提供了强大框架，对自主水下推进系统设计和仿生运动领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: This study presents a computational framework for optimizing undulatory
swimming profiles using a combination of design-by-morphing and Bayesian
optimization strategies. The body deformation is expressed as a linear
combination of five baseline bio-inspired profiles, including two
unconventional shapes to enhance diversity in the design space. The
optimization objective is to maximize propulsive efficiency over a wide range
of frequency-wavelength combinations. The Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian
formulation is employed to simulate the unsteady flow around two-dimensional
undulating swimmers. The optimized profile achieves a significantly improved
efficiency of 82.4\%, while the second- and third-best profiles achieve
efficiencies of 51.8\% and 42.8\%, respectively, outperforming the benchmark
anguilliform and carangiform profiles by leveraging advantageous surface stress
distributions and effective energy recovery mechanisms. A detailed force
decomposition reveals that the optimal swimmer minimizes resistive drag and
maximizes constructive work contributions, particularly in the anterior and
posterior body regions. Spatial and temporal work decomposition indicates a
strategic redistribution of input and recovered energy, enhancing performance
while reducing energetic cost. The wake topology associated with the optimized
swimmer exhibits organized and coherent vortex structures, reflecting superior
fluid-structure interaction characteristics compared to conventional profiles.
These findings demonstrate that morphing-based parametric design, when guided
by surrogate-assisted optimization, offers a powerful framework for discovering
energetically efficient swimming gaits, with significant implications for the
design of autonomous underwater propulsion systems and the broader field of
bio-inspired locomotion.

Motivation: 解决在硅片尺寸基板上沉积的溶液薄膜在干燥过程中达到一致干燥速率的问题，这对薄膜在临界浓度时的性能指标至关重要。

Method: 使用两阶段最小二乘梯度下降求解一组方程，得到最优空气刀轨迹，该轨迹取决于基板上初始湿膜厚度分布。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为特定类型的湿膜厚度分布提供最优空气刀轨迹，实现更一致的干燥过程，但对某些厚度分布形状存在局限性。

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of achieving consistent drying rates of a
solution film deposited on a $20\,\rm{cm}$-wide substrate ($\approx $
silicon-wafer size) that is driven under a narrow air flow ejected by a slot
nozzle (or "air knife"). The main prerequisite of the work is that the drying
rate of the solution film is highly decisive for a certain performance
indicator of the deposited film at a particular, critical concentration $c_{\rm
crit.}$. Empirically, this concentration can be associated with the visual
observation of "the drying front" as, for the example of hybrid perovskite thin
films, caused by the onset of a crystallization process. As a main result, a
set of equations for achieving consistent drying rates, $\dot{d}_{\rm crit.}$,
at critical concentration is presented that is solved by a simple two-staged
least-squares gradient decent. From the resulting velocity vector, an optimal
trajectory of the air knife, $\hat{x}(t)$, depending on the initial wet film
thickness distribution over the substrate is derived. It is demonstrated that
scenarios where the wet film thickness increases along the movement direction
of the air knife have a consistent set of equations. Wet thin films that do not
obey this constraint, as in the demonstrated scenarios with convex and concave
shapes of wet film thickness over the substrate area, cannot always be dried in
a fully consistent way by optimizing the air-knife trajectory alone. However,
with the presented methods, optimal trajectories can still be derived that
enable more homogeneous drying results.

Conclusion: 停滞点附近的通过时间奇异性与输运特性密切相关，系综方差的增长模式取决于停滞点的类型和性质。

Abstract: We consider transport of passive particles in steady laminar plane flows of
incompressible viscous fluids. While drifting along the streamlines, the
particles experience alternating accelerations and slowdowns. For an ensemble
of particles, recurring slow passages across the vicinities of stagnation
points affect the transport and result in the unbounded growth of the ensemble
variance. This growth is logarithmic in case of generic stagnation points and
has a power-law character in the presence of degeneracies. We interrelate
quantitative characteristics of the variance growth with the singularities of
the passage time and derive explicit estimates for the transport exponents.

Motivation: 探究不同流动配置中壁面法向速度方差和谱的普适性标度关系，解释先前研究中观察到的ZPG边界层壁面法向方差差异。

Method: 对通道、管道和零压力梯度边界层湍流进行直接数值模拟，分析跨展向波数谱和壁面法向速度方差，覆盖壁面摩擦雷诺数的一个量级范围。

Result: 发现谱峰值与局部剪应力立方和湍动能耗散率成正比，而不是与表面剪切速度Uτ相关。在高雷诺数极限下，谱峰值导致的方差为局部剪应力的1.45至1.65倍。

Conclusion: 壁面法向运动主要是'主动'的，直接贡献于局部剪应力，但精确比例常数的普适性受到低波数'非主动'运动的轻微影响而受到限制。

Abstract: The variance and spectra of wall-normal velocities are investigated for
direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow in a channel, pipe, and
zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) boundary layer, across a decade of wall friction
Reynolds numbers. Spectra along the spanwise wavenumber have a pronounced peak
at intermediate wavenumbers that is proportional to the turbulent kinetic
energy dissipation rate and the cube of the local shear stress throughout the
bottom half of the boundary layer for all flow cases. The observed scaling with
the local stress rather than the surface shear velocity $U_\tau$ accounts for
differences in the ZPG wall-normal variance seen in previous studies. The
scaling is attributed to the fact that wall-normal motions are predominately
`active' per Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis and directly contribute to the
local shear stress, while noting this hypothesis does not account for the
linear decay of the total stress in enclosed flows. The Reynolds number
dependence of the variance is determined from the scale separation between the
spectrum peak and the dissipative cutoff, where the resulting semi-empirical
fit aligns with variance values in the literature. At the high-Reynolds-number
limit, the spectral peak leads to a variance between 1.45 to 1.65 times the
local shear stress. This range is consistent with previous predictions relative
to $U_\tau$, including for the vertical velocity in the near-neutral
atmospheric boundary layer. However, universality in the exact proportional
constant is precluded by relatively minor contributions from the `inactive'
motions at low wavenumbers, which vary with wall-normal position and for
different flow configurations.

Motivation: 传统亚格子应力模型是确定性的，无法捕捉湍流的随机特性，而生成式AI在湍流建模中尚未得到应用。

Method: 使用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)从粗粒度速度场重建亚格子应力，学习条件分布而非点值。

Conclusion: 这种生成式方法通过学习条件分布，为高雷诺数下的亚格子湍流建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Turbulence governs the transport of momentum, energy, and scalars in many
geophysical and engineering flows. In large-eddy simulations (LES),
parameterizing subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses remains a central challenge, as
unresolved physical processes strongly influence turbulent transport.
Traditional SGS models, such as the Smagorinsky-type models and deep neural
networks (DNNs), are deterministic and cannot capture the stochastic nature of
turbulence. Despite its wide application in computer vision and natural
language processing, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has not previously
been applied to directly compute SGS stresses in three-dimensional turbulent
boundary layers at high Reynolds numbers. Here we introduce a denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to reconstruct SGS stresses from
coarse-grained velocity fields in direct numerical simulations of the
atmospheric boundary layer. The DDPM consistently outperforms Smagorinsky-type
models and previous deep neural networks in terms of spatial correlations and
probability distributions for deviatoric stresses, and can be applied to unseen
convective stability conditions and resolutions. By learning conditional
distributions rather than pointwise values, this generative approach opens a
new direction for SGS turbulence modeling at high Reynolds numbers.

Motivation: 拉格朗日粒子追踪提供时间分辨的粒子轨迹测量，但实验数据空间稀疏、可能有噪声，且惯性输运使问题复杂化，需要研究能否可靠地同时推断欧拉场和粒子特性。

Result: 在三种代表性流动状态下证明了联合可观测性：湍流边界层中可恢复流场和真实粒子位置；均匀各向同性湍流中可同时恢复流场和粒子直径；可压缩激波主导流中首次实现了速度、压力、密度和惯性粒子特性的联合重建。

Conclusion: 结果表明LPT的应用范围可扩展到多相流和高速流动，即使在示踪剂和测量保真度受限的情况下也能实现可靠推断。

Abstract: We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown
particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers
time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but
experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further
complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both
Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To
address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian
flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous
inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing
equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish
empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative
regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow
states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous
isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate
simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the
feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible,
shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity,
pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density),
highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in
supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding
density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy,
yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these
results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and
high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.

Motivation: 研究惯性波与地转涡旋流的相互作用机制，特别是波在临界层附近的吸收和反射行为，这对于理解旋转流体系统中的能量和角动量传输具有重要意义。

Method: 推导并分析了描述在轴对称微分旋转背景下传播的收敛和发散柱面波的波动方程，研究了波在临界层附近的行为，并建立了考虑粘性耗散的模型。

Result: 发现单色波在无粘极限下不会对涡旋流施加力矩，直到在临界层内被吸收；只有携带与涡旋旋转方向相同角动量的收敛波会被吸收，相反方向的波会被反射；修正了短波极限下的波列近似方法。

Conclusion: 惯性波与地转涡旋流的相互作用受临界层机制控制，波的吸收取决于角动量符号匹配和涡旋角速度大小，粘性效应在临界层附近起重要作用。

Abstract: We study interaction of inertial waves with geostrophic flow in a rapidly
rotating fluid system. In accordance with experimental conditions in [1, 2], we
consider inertial waves, which were excited by a source being near side
boundary of the flow and enter the region where geostrophic vortex flow is
present. The wave equation is derived and analyzed in the paper that describes
the propagation of convergent and divergent cylindrical waves on the background
of mean vortex flow, which is considered as an axisymmetric differential
rotation. We show that a monochromatic wave does not exert any torque on the
vortex flow in the inviscid limit until it is absorbed inside the critical
layer. Among convergent waves those only are absorbed which carries angular
momentum of the same sign as one's of the rotation in the vortex. Convergent
waves with the opposite sign of angular momentum are just reflected from the
vortex. The absorption of a wave is possible only if the vortex flow is
characterized by fast enough angular velocity there. The behavior of the wave
near the critical layer can be described by the well-known model where the mean
flow is rectilinear shear flow. We show that the conventional wave train
approximation for the short-wave limit is not applicable in the vicinity of the
layer and revise it, deriving the proper equation and reformulating the
conservation law of wave action. For the vicinity of critical layer, a model
which accounts for the viscous dissipation is derived; viscous effects are
studied for absorption both of monochromatic wave and wave train.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于可压缩两相流模拟的迭代IMPES求解器和新型时间步长准则，该准则基于CFL条件并使用数值计算的速度导数来自适应调整时间步长，在不同流动场景下表现出高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间步长准则（如Coats准则）在不同流动特征（压力主导或毛细管主导）下需要调整数值参数，且在处理可压缩流体时质量守恒性能不足，需要开发更通用和鲁棒的时间步长控制方法。

Method: 结合迭代IMPES求解器和基于CFL条件的新型时间步长准则，该准则通过数值计算速度导数来自适应调整时间步长，无需针对不同流动特征调整参数。

Result: 新方法在各种流动场景（包括压力降主导和毛细管主导流动）下均表现出高效性和鲁棒性，在Buckley-Leverett问题和重力-毛细管平衡示例中比Coats准则需要更少的时间迭代次数，在空气压缩示例中显著改善了非润湿相的质量守恒。

Conclusion: 提出的新型时间步长准则结合迭代IMPES求解器为可压缩两相流模拟提供了一种通用、高效且鲁棒的解决方案，能够适应不同流动特征而无需参数调整，并在质量守恒方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present an iterative IMPES solver and a novel timestep criterion for the
simulation of immiscible two-phase flow involving compressible fluid phases.
The novel timestep criterion uses the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition
and employs numerically computed velocity derivatives to adapt the timestep
size, regardless of the dominant flow characteristics. The solver combined with
this timestep criterion demonstrates both efficiency and robustness across a
range of flow scenarios, including pressure drop dominated and capillary
dominated flows with compressible and incompressible fluid phases, without the
need to adjust any numerical parameters. Furthermore, it successfully reaches
the expected stationary states in a case involving discontinuous porous media
parameters such as porosity, permeabilities, and capillary pressure function.
Comparison with the established Coats timestep criterion reveals that our
approach requires fewer time iterations while maintaining comparable accuracy
on the Buckley-Leverett problem and a gravity-capillary equalization example
with a known stationary state. Additionally, in an example with air
compression, the new timestep criterion leads to a significantly improved
non-wetting phase mass conservation compared to the Coats criterion.

### [163] [Kinetic closure of turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00779)
*Francesco Marson,Orestis Malaspinas*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了一种过滤Boltzmann-BGK方程的动力学闭合方法，为湍流描述提供了新途径。该闭合方法无需显式建模就能自然包含湍流亚滤波应力张量，并通过推广BGK碰撞算子考虑非守恒矩中的亚滤波湍流扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Navier-Stokes模型需要显式建模湍流亚滤波应力张量，而该方法旨在提供一种无需尺度分离或Smagorinsky型假设的替代湍流描述方法。

Method: 通过推广BGK碰撞算子来实现过滤Boltzmann-BGK方程的动力学闭合，无需显式建模亚滤波应力张量，也不要求尺度分离。

Result: Chapman-Enskog分析表明其流体动力学极限精确收敛于过滤Navier-Stokes方程，速度梯度分离了亚滤波贡献。Taylor-Green涡和湍流混合层的格子Boltzmann模拟验证了改进的稳定性和减少的耗散。

Conclusion: 该方法为湍流建模提供了新的动力学闭合框架，相比Smagorinsky模型具有更好的稳定性和更低的耗散特性。

Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann-BGK
equation, paving the way towards an alternative description of turbulence. The
closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without
the need for explicit modeling, unlike in Navier-Stokes models. In contrast, it
accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by
generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale
separation nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor. The
Chapman-Enskog analysis shows that its hydrodynamic limit converges exactly to
the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating
subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of
the Taylor-Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved
stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动的湍流建模框架，通过隐式-显式混合方法修改RANS方程，结合机器学习模块来估计新变量，在FDA喷嘴中验证了流动预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统湍流模型在复杂流动预测中存在局限性，需要数据驱动方法来提高预测精度和泛化能力。

Method: 基于Hilbert基定理推导不变输入特征，通过特征值-向量分解获取雷诺应力张量输出，在OpenFOAM中开发求解器，使用MLP和Deep-Insight方法训练神经网络。

Result: 在方管湍流中验证了模型重现湍流各向异性和二次流动的能力，Deep-Insight网络在FDA血液喷嘴中表现出更好的湍流结构预测效果。

Conclusion: 数据驱动增强方法在湍流建模中具有良好前景，能够改善复杂流动的预测精度。

Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for turbulence modeling, applied to flow
prediction in the FDA nozzle. In this study, the standard RANS equations have
been modified using an implicit-explicit hybrid approach. New variables were
introduced, and a solver was developed within the OpenFOAM framework,
integrating a machine learning module to estimate these variables. The
invariant input features were derived based on Hilbert's basis theorem, and the
outputs of the machine learning model were obtained through eigenvalue-vector
decomposition of the Reynolds stress tensor. Validation was performed using DNS
data for turbulent flow in a square channel at various Reynolds numbers. A
baseline MLP was first trained at $Re=2900$ and tested at $Re=3500$ to assess
its ability to reproduce turbulence anisotropy and secondary flows. To further
enhance generalization, three benchmark DNS datasets were transformed into
images via the Deep-Insight method, enabling the use of convolutional neural
networks. The trained Deep-Insight network demonstrated improved prediction of
turbulence structures in the FDA blood nozzle, highlighting the promise of
data-driven augmentation in turbulence modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化RAG测试问题语义覆盖度的新方法，使用向量嵌入和聚类技术来验证测试集对知识库的覆盖完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估缺乏系统方法来确保测试集充分覆盖底层知识库，导致开发者存在盲点

Method: 将文档块和测试问题嵌入统一向量空间，计算基本邻近度、内容加权覆盖度和多主题问题覆盖度等指标，并集成异常检测来过滤无关问题

Result: 两个不同用例的实验证明该框架能有效量化测试覆盖度，识别覆盖不足的内容区域，并为生成新的高价值测试问题提供具体建议

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供了构建更健壮测试套件的必要工具，从而提高系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别未对齐文档等应用

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

TL;DR: TransIP是一种基于Transformer的原子间势能模型，通过嵌入空间优化实现SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束，在Open Molecules数据集上达到与最先进等变模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的机器学习原子间势能模型通过等变神经网络架构强制施加旋转平移对称性，这种硬编码的归纳偏置往往导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 提出TransIP训练范式，引导通用的非等变Transformer模型通过在嵌入空间优化表示来学习SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束。

Result: 在Open Molecules数据集上，TransIP在机器学习力场方面达到与最先进等变基线模型相当的性能。相比数据增强基线，在不同数据集规模下性能提升40%至60%。

Conclusion: 学习到的等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的有力且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合时导致精度下降的问题，并提出Q-ROAR方法来解决这些问题，在保持短上下文性能的同时显著提升长上下文任务的困惑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对于处理长距离依赖任务至关重要。RoPE插值方法和后训练量化使模型支持更长输入且便于部署，但两者结合会导致精度下降，需要系统分析并解决。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组为少量频带，对Key和Query权重进行轻量级搜索，使用插值压力和尾膨胀比作为诊断指标，无需微调或架构修改。

Result: Q-ROAR将长上下文工作负载的困惑度降低了14%以上，同时保持了短上下文性能、推理吞吐量和现有LLM系统栈的兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR有效解决了RoPE插值与量化结合时的精度问题，为量化LLM的长上下文支持提供了实用解决方案，无需额外部署开销。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DexBench是首个针对糖尿病患者日常决策任务的LLM评估基准，包含7个任务类别和360,600个个性化问题，评估了8个LLM在5个指标上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健康基准要么过于通用，要么面向临床医生，缺乏针对糖尿病患者日常决策的专门评估框架。

Method: 收集15,000名糖尿病患者一个月的连续血糖监测数据和行为日志，生成个性化问题，在7个任务类别上评估8个LLM的5个指标表现。

Result: 不同模型在不同任务和指标上表现差异显著，没有单一模型在所有维度上持续领先。

Conclusion: 该基准旨在提升糖尿病护理AI解决方案的可靠性、安全性、有效性和实用性。

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

*Gregory D. Baker,Scott McCallum,Dirk Pattinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在p-adic度量空间中进行机器学习的理论基础，证明了p-adic回归必须通过至少n+1个数据点，这与欧几里得回归形成鲜明对比，更适合处理层次化数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器学习问题常涉及层次化数据，但传统欧几里得度量无法捕捉层次关系的离散分支特性，需要更适合的数学框架。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的机器学习理论框架，证明p-adic回归的核心定理及其推论，并在自然语言处理中进行应用验证。

Result: 证明了n维p-adic平面最小化距离时必须通过至少n+1个数据点，多项式回归也有类似性质，这些性质与层次数据的离散特性高度契合。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是正确处理机器学习中层次化数据结构的基础工具，在层次数据中选择实际观测点作为代表比插值更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

*Abdelrhman Gaber,Hassan Abd-Eltawab,Youssif Abuzied,Muhammad ElMahdy,Tamer ElBatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align是一个联邦学习框架，利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，将表格数据序列化为文本，生成语义对齐的嵌入表示，解决了联邦学习中表格数据异构性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域具有吸引力，但表格数据的异构性（不同客户端间的模式差异和不兼容特征空间）阻碍了直接聚合。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，使用DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa和ClinicalBERT等预训练LLM生成语义对齐的嵌入表示，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测任务中，FedLLM-Align在所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络上均优于现有基线方法，F1分数提升高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%。在极端模式差异下的压力测试中表现稳健。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align为异构环境中的联邦学习提供了一个鲁棒、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Result: 在多种数据集上验证了方法的准确性、可扩展性和效率，支持多种成本函数和类条件传输。

Conclusion: 该方法为最优传输应用提供了理论严谨且通用的工具，具有可证明的最优性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Motivation: 许多真实世界的序数数据在某些解释变量值下会出现非单峰的條件概率分布，而传统的单峰似然模型对这些数据存在偏差，因此需要开发能够处理接近单峰分布的模型。

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够更好地适应真实世界序数数据的分布特性，在保持单峰优势的同时缓解了对非单峰数据的偏差问题。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法能够有效将transformer模型转换为SNN版本，在保持性能的同时显著提升能效，具有很好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

Motivation: 人类通过比较多样化观察来学习概念，这种认知机制对机器概念学习也很重要，可为该领域提供理论支持。

Method: 开发理论框架分析多类别观察下概念的可识别性，利用类别间的充分多样性，无需特定假设，支持局部比较和隐藏结构识别。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了强化学习中有限反馈下的奖励选择问题(RLLF)，研究如何在只有部分样本获得奖励标签的情况下，选择最有影响力的奖励来最大化策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际问题中，获取大量奖励标签往往不可行，特别是在依赖人工反馈时。当强化学习必须在有限反馈下进行时，需要确定哪些样本应该被标记以最大化策略性能。

Method: 研究了两类选择策略：(i) 依赖无奖励信息的启发式方法，如状态访问和部分价值函数；(ii) 使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 发现关键的奖励子集是那些能够引导智能体沿最优轨迹前进，并在偏离后支持恢复到接近最优行为的奖励。有效的选择方法可以用显著少于完全监督的奖励标签获得接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的有力范式，能够在有限反馈下实现接近最优的性能。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Motivation: AI决策系统在关键领域广泛应用，但由于无法了解算法内部机制，只能通过输出结果来评估公平性。反事实公平性度量面临识别性挑战，即无法从数据和知识中唯一确定。

Method: 采用部分识别方法，从观测数据中推导反事实公平性度量的信息边界，引入贝叶斯方法以高置信度约束未知的反事实公平性度量。

Result: 在COMPAS数据集上的实验显示，将种族改为非洲裔美国人会对COMPAS分数产生正向（虚假）效应，而从年轻到年老的年龄转变则产生负向（直接因果）效应。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯部分识别方法能够有效评估反事实公平性，为无法直接识别的公平性度量提供了可行的评估框架。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在看似简单的多位数乘法任务上失败的原因，探索成功学习乘法的模型工作机制。

Method: 逆向工程分析成功学习乘法的模型，使用logit归因和线性探针研究长程依赖，分析注意力机制如何构建有向无环图来缓存和检索部分乘积。

Result: 发现成功模型通过Minkowski和实现部分乘积，使用傅里叶基表示数字，而标准微调模型缺乏这些有效表示。通过引入预测"运行和"的辅助损失，成功解决了长程依赖学习问题。

Conclusion: 揭示了Transformer学习长程依赖的陷阱，证明了正确归纳偏置可以解决这一问题，为理解模型内部工作机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

Motivation: LoRA的表示能力通常落后于全量微调，关键问题是如何从过参数化空间中获得表达能力强的低秩适配器

Method: 提出PrunedLoRA框架，在微调过程中动态剪枝不太重要的组件并防止其重新激活，通过最小化整体损失的剪枝误差，在基于梯度的剪枝策略中提供细粒度剪枝和恢复更新

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解等监督微调任务中，PrunedLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体，并在不同稀疏度水平下优于现有结构化剪枝方法

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过结构化剪枝实现了灵活自适应的秩分配，提供了首个结构化剪枝鲁棒性的理论分析，证明基于梯度的剪枝在权重扰动影响下比基于激活的剪枝更鲁棒

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

TL;DR: GRPO-λ是GRPO的扩展方法，通过λ-return和资格迹增强LLM在复杂推理任务中的信用分配能力，显著提升训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法缺乏明确的奖励或评论家模型，无法在token序列上进行细粒度的信用分配，限制了推理能力的进一步提升。

Method: 提出GRPO-λ方法，使用token级对数概率重新制定资格迹来近似λ-return学习，并引入无评论家的时序差分误差近似，提出了几种λ-return加权变体。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数的模型上，相比GRPO在训练过程中性能提升30-40%，在多个数学推理数据集上平均性能提升超过3分，7B模型提升4.5分。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的RL微调效果，为后训练方法提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Motivation: 当前LLM生态系统中有各种不同规模、能力和成本的路由器，但没有单一模型适用于所有场景，因此需要选择最合适的路由器。然而，各种路由器的快速涌现使得选择变得困难，需要类似模型排行榜的路由器比较平台。

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在两个关键低效问题：大型激活张量的冗余内存访问导致运行时开销，以及无法在相同GPU上并发微调多个共享基础模型的独立LoRA适配器，错失了减少流水线气泡、改善通信重叠和GPU负载平衡等性能收益。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过核级和调度级优化有效解决了LoRA微调系统的效率问题，可作为现有LoRA系统的即插即用替代方案，显著提升微调性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可有效集成到其他元学习算法中，提高计算效率和收敛速度

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际部署中的潜在问题，特别是多指令提示场景下可能导致的指令忽略和系统提示泄露问题。

Method: 识别压缩导致的指令退化问题，以系统提示泄露为案例研究，分析压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差等因素的影响，并提出改进的KV缓存驱逐策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩后会迅速退化，导致被LLM完全忽略，系统提示泄露问题在压缩后更加严重，受多种因素影响。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩在多指令场景中存在显著风险，需要谨慎部署，改进的驱逐策略可以减轻这些影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Motivation: 深度学习训练算法通常将小批量样本视为单一对象，仅计算梯度平均值。作者认为计算其他梯度统计信息在AD框架中并非资源密集型任务，且能带来新的算法设计可能性。

Method: 通过自动微分图手术实现梯度统计计算，在JAX中使用向量化变换进行原型开发。研究了signSGD中符号操作的最佳位置，以及基于单样本梯度变换的Adam预处理器变体。

Result: 发现signSGD的成功取决于符号操作在梯度处理链中的位置，可通过信噪比预测；Adam预处理器优化效果最佳时更依赖梯度均值而非方差，与传统认知相反。

Conclusion: 单样本梯度信息为算法设计开启了新的分析和可能性，证明在AD框架中高效计算梯度统计是可行的，且能带来优化算法的新见解。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

Result: 提示多样性训练使SFT能泛化到未见指令变体，思维链监督显著改善向更难任务的迁移，两者结合达到最佳泛化效果。

Conclusion: SFT在适当数据策展下能达到与RL相当的泛化能力，挑战了SFT天生不如RL的叙事。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用基于奖励的策略来自动优化变分自编码器(VAE)工作流程，通过高斯混合模型(GMM)和贝叶斯高斯混合模型(BGMM)来评估潜在空间表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释和简约的形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE虽然能构建低维表示，但其性能严重依赖多个非近视设计选择，通常需要通过试错和经验分析来优化。

Method: 使用压电响应力显微镜数据作为模型系统，研究了多种策略和奖励函数来评估潜在空间表示。通过GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间来构建奖励函数。

Result: 分析表明，使用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间为构建奖励函数提供了坚实基础，能够估计模型效率并指导寻找最优简约表示。

Conclusion: 基于奖励的策略能够实现VAE工作流程的自动化和无偏优化，GMM和BGMM方法为构建有效的奖励函数提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Motivation: 受编码计算范式的启发，将其应用于机器学习，设计有效的正则化机制来鼓励更平滑的表征和更可泛化的解决方案。

Method: 设计coded-smoothing模块，可集成到监督和无监督训练流程中，通过处理数据的线性组合来正则化学习，并在推理流程中随机化模型以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在监督和无监督任务上的广泛实验表明，coded-smoothing持续改善泛化能力，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击中达到最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: coded-smoothing是一种高效且有效的正则化机制，能够显著提升模型的泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性，计算开销极小。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了序列模型在涉及状态跟踪和关联回忆的复合问题上的长度泛化能力，发现混合模型中的Transformer组件倾向于利用捷径解决方案，并提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来改善长度泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现循环网络擅长状态跟踪但回忆能力差，而Transformer擅长回忆但状态跟踪能力无法扩展到长序列。受这两种架构互补优势的启发，研究者构建混合模型来评估是否能够同时保留这两种能力。

Method: 构建整合循环和注意力组件的混合模型，并提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来缓解Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，延迟注意力层训练的方法显著改善了混合模型的长度泛化性能，使模型在比训练序列长三倍的混合序列上达到接近完美的准确率（>90%）。

Conclusion: Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖是混合模型长度泛化的主要障碍，而延迟注意力层训练是一种简单有效的策略，能够显著提升混合模型在长序列上的性能表现。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变分自编码器中存在的'先验空洞'问题，即先验分布高概率区域在后验分布中概率较低，导致生成样本质量差的问题。

Method: 将先验建模为基于能量的模型，采用变分方法处理归一化常数，使用采样器网络近似变分形式，通过交替优化训练先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均显示出改进。

Conclusion: EVaLP方法能够有效匹配后验分布，同时保持快速采样能力，解决了VAE生成模糊样本的问题。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: SLogic是一个新颖的知识图谱补全框架，通过为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态评分，利用查询头实体的局部子图信息来评估规则的重要性，从而超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于逻辑规则的方法通常将规则视为通用的，为每个规则分配固定置信度，忽略了查询特定的上下文。这是一个重要限制，因为规则的重要性会因查询而异。

Method: 引入SLogic框架，其核心是一个评分函数，利用查询头实体为中心的局部子图信息，动态评估每个规则的重要性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic持续优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过查询相关的规则评分机制，有效解决了传统逻辑规则方法忽略查询上下文的问题，在知识图谱补全任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

TL;DR: Freedave是一种针对扩散大语言模型的无损并行解码算法，通过候选生成和验证的流水线，在不引入额外模型前向调用的情况下，将推理吞吐量提升至2.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有双向注意力机制的优势，但由于不兼容KV缓存，推理效率不如自回归模型。现有并行解码算法会带来性能下降。

Method: 提出Freedave算法，采用并行解码的候选生成和验证流水线，保证生成与静态采样相同的序列。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，DLLMs的吞吐量提升至2.8倍，且无性能损失。

Conclusion: Freedave成功解决了DLLMs推理效率低的问题，实现了无损的并行解码加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在平稳数据中表现优异，但在非平稳环境中由于塑性损失现象而难以持续学习，需要从理论层面理解这一现象的根本原因。

Method: 基于动力系统理论，通过识别参数空间中的稳定流形来正式定义塑性损失，分析梯度轨迹被捕获的机制，包括激活饱和导致的冻结单元和表示冗余导致的克隆单元流形。

Result: 研究发现促进静态环境泛化的特性（如低秩表示和简单性偏置）与持续学习中的塑性损失存在根本性矛盾，并通过数值模拟验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 塑性损失是梯度学习中的基本现象，需要在架构选择或针对性扰动中寻找缓解策略，以平衡静态泛化与持续学习能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Motivation: 将Lipschitz bandit问题扩展到存在随机延迟反馈的场景，其中奖励不是立即观察到而是经过随机延迟后才获得，这在现实应用中更为常见。

Method: 对于有界延迟，提出了延迟感知的缩放算法；对于无界延迟，设计了新颖的分阶段学习策略，在精心安排的间隔内积累可靠反馈。

Result: 在有界延迟下，算法保持了无延迟设置的最优性能，仅增加与最大延迟相关的项；在无界延迟下，算法达到接近最优的遗憾界（最多相差对数因子）。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在各种延迟场景下都表现出高效性，实验验证了方法的有效性，为解决延迟反馈下的连续动作空间bandit问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Motivation: 当前LLM依赖思维链进行推理判断，这种依赖形成了强大但脆弱的信任基础。攻击者可能诱导LLM生成看似合理但实际错误的推理链，这种隐蔽风险尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 利用LLM自身幻觉，通过对模型自然生成的错误推理进行微调，结合GRPO策略优化和翻转奖励机制，并添加合理性正则化器以保持推理过程的流畅性和良性外观。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，同时在良性场景下性能下降最小。人类评估显示难以区分被操纵的推理过程与良性推理。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄然破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，强调了未来研究应对这一警示性风险的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,

Motivation: 虽然跳跃连接能稳定Transformer训练，但它们破坏了表示的层次结构。本文旨在探索是否可以不依赖跳跃连接来高效训练Transformer，同时保持其层次表示能力。

Method: 通过分析无跳跃连接Transformer块的雅可比矩阵，揭示跳跃连接改善条件数的机制，并设计了一种原则性的初始化策略来恢复其稳定化效益。

Result: 在监督和自监督设置下，使用该初始化方法训练的无跳跃连接ViT克服了优化障碍，学习了更丰富的层次表示，并在密集预测基准上超越了包含跳跃连接的强基线。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接不是训练ViT的基本要求，这为视觉模型中的层次表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

### [204] [In-Context Curiosity: Distilling Exploration for Decision-Pretrained Transformers on Bandit Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00347)
*Huitao Yang,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)框架，通过上下文好奇心正则化器增强决策预训练变换器(DPTs)，使用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号来改善离线预训练中的分布外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策预训练变换器(DPTs)在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要解决离线预训练中的泛化限制问题。

Method: 引入上下文好奇心正则化器，在PPT框架中增加辅助奖励预测器，利用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号，鼓励训练期间进行更广泛的探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机的概念验证实验中，PPT显示出改进的鲁棒性，特别是在预训练数据多样性有限且测试环境奖励方差较高时，能够缓解DPT的性能下降。

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然至关重要，但好奇心驱动的预训练为增强上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

TL;DR: 分析了约束马尔可夫决策过程（CMDPs）中初始状态分布变化对最优值的影响，通过对偶分析和线性规划扰动分析推导了变化界限，并展示了如何利用这些界限分析因初始分布未知变化导致的策略遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMDPs比标准MDPs更复杂，因为不存在适用于所有初始状态分布的通用最优策略，当初始分布变化时需要重新求解CMDP。

Method: 使用CMDPs的对偶分析和线性规划中的扰动分析来推导最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Result: 推导出了CMDPs最优值随不同初始分布变化的界限。

Conclusion: 这些界限可用于分析因初始分布未知变化导致的策略遗憾，为CMDPs在动态初始分布环境中的应用提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kanzi是一个基于流的蛋白质结构分词器，通过扩散自编码器和流匹配损失简化了蛋白质结构表示，在更小的模型规模和训练成本下实现了更好的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质结构分词方法依赖于定制组件，虽然具有空间对称不变性，但难以优化和扩展。需要一种更简单、高效的方法来处理蛋白质结构表示。

Method: 使用基于流的扩散自编码器，采用流匹配损失。用全局坐标替换基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替换SE(3)不变注意力操作，简化了模型架构。

Result: 该方法训练更稳定，参数效率更高，在重建指标上优于现有分词器，且模型规模和训练成本显著降低。自回归模型在生成性能上优于基于token的模型，但尚未达到最先进连续扩散模型的水平。

Conclusion: Kanzi提供了一种简化的蛋白质结构分词方法，通过流匹配和扩散自编码器实现了高效的结构表示，为多模态蛋白质模型提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

TL;DR: AReUReDi是一种离散优化算法，通过结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在多目标序列设计中保证收敛到帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在治疗和生物分子工程中，设计满足多个冲突目标的序列是一个核心挑战。现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行，而离散方法缺乏多目标帕累托最优性的保证。

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在保持分布不变性的同时偏向帕累托最优状态采样。

Result: 应用于肽和SMILES序列设计，同时优化多达五个治疗特性（亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi为多属性生物分子生成建立了一个强大的基于序列的框架。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临数据分布漂移的挑战，传统Transformer架构在持续学习场景下存在塑性损失和灾难性遗忘问题

Method: 提出仅查询注意力机制，丢弃键和值但保留Transformer核心归纳偏置，建立与元学习的概念联系

Result: 在持续学习场景中，简化机制显著缓解塑性损失和灾难性遗忘，性能优于基线方法，Hessian谱分析显示保持高曲率秩的模型更易保持塑性

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中捕获元学习益处可能不是必需的，仅查询注意力机制提供了有效的替代方案

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽然能生成符号控制策略，但无法分离策略的功能结构和数值参数，导致搜索过程缓慢低效。

Method: 将LLM生成程序的数值参数提取出来进行数值优化，LLM迭代程序功能结构，同时用单独的优化循环寻找局部最优参数集。

Result: 在一系列控制任务上评估，相比纯LLM引导搜索，该方法获得了更高的回报和更好的样本效率。

Conclusion: 结合符号程序合成和数值优化可以产生可解释且高性能的策略，弥合了语言模型引导设计与经典控制调优之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: GDLNN通过结合领域特定语言和神经网络，成功实现了高准确性和可解释性的平衡，为图分类任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知实验通常只控制单一因素并用标量总结性能，需要开发能同时控制多个因素并生成完整性能曲面的方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯高斯过程概率分类器，在沉浸式虚拟环境中进行5×5工作记忆重建任务，主动控制空间负载L和特征绑定负载K两个变量。

Result: 与传统自适应阶梯方法相比，新方法在K=3时具有相当性能（组内相关系数0.755），但能更快收敛（约30个样本即可准确拟合），并揭示空间负载与特征绑定的个体交互差异。

Conclusion: 双轴主动分类方法能有效估计完整性能曲面，比传统方法更高效，为认知能力评估提供了更丰富的信息。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Result: 发现的新混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模下验证损失持续降低，下游任务准确率提升最高达2.8-8.3%（平均1.1-3.1%），同时提高了训练和推理效率

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效发现优于现有Transformer架构的混合模型设计，为大规模语言模型架构探索提供了系统化方法

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够有效学习物理一致的动力学，同时提供哈密顿量的不确定性估计，并通过设计确保能量平衡和被动性。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在微调阶段，从目标分布中获取的样本通常很少，现有方法将这些样本作为验证集来评估训练池中样本的效果，但这种方法效率较低。

Method: 反转训练和验证的角色：在验证集上微调前后对训练池进行推理，选择预测变化最大的样本。关键洞察是受微调影响最大的训练样本对减少目标分布上的测试损失最有益。

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务中，该方法在大多数情况下实现了比现有方法更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 提出的方法比现有数据选择方法更简单、更快，并通过理论分析支持了实证结果。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: G2R提供了一种全面评估图相似度的有效方法，在准确性和效率方面都表现出色，为图检索等任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity

### [219] [Can Mamba Learn In Context with Outliers? A Theoretical Generalization Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00399)
*Hongkang Li,Songtao Lu,Xiaodong Cui,Pin-Yu Chen,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态及其在包含异常值的二元分类任务中的上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，发现Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型，并在多种语言任务中表现相当，但其理论理解因非线性门控机制而受限。本文旨在填补Mamba模型理论分析的空白，特别是在上下文学习能力方面。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型的训练动态，该模型由线性注意力组件和非线性门控层组成。通过与线性Transformer在相同设置下的分析进行比较，研究模型在包含加性异常值的提示下的上下文学习泛化能力。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然Mamba可能需要更多训练迭代才能收敛，但在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: Mamba模型在上下文学习中具有鲁棒性，能够有效处理异常值，这一理论发现得到了实证实验的支持。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

*Zhouyang Liu,Ning Liu,Yixin Chen,Jiezhong He,Menghan Jia,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的GNN架构，通过保持节点根子树中特征的相对位置来解决子图匹配中的尺度差异问题，并引入相似性主导比增强度量来提高匹配图对的排名能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN方法在子图匹配中存在尺度差异问题，它们关注特征数量但忽略特征在节点根子树中的相对位置，导致包含约束被破坏和错误预测。此外，它们的铰链距离度量对匹配图对缺乏区分能力，阻碍了排名应用。

Method: NC-Iso通过构建节点根子树内相邻梯队之间的层次依赖关系来保持特征的相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征数量上保持一致的层次结构并符合包含约束。引入相似性主导比增强度量来量化图对之间相似性相对于不相似性的主导程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果验证了NC-Iso的有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，同时保持了时间效率。

Conclusion: NC-Iso为子图检索提供了一个更具区分度的神经子图匹配解决方案，解决了现有方法的尺度差异和排名能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

### [221] [AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404)
*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，揭示了现有SAE变体的局限性，并提出了AbsTopK SAE新方法，能够保留正负激活值以表示双向概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏理论推导框架，且其稀疏正则化器强制非负性，导致无法表示双向概念（如男/女），限制了语义表示的完整性。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，推导出常见SAE变体，并基于ℓ₀稀疏约束提出AbsTopK SAE，对最大幅度激活值进行硬阈值处理。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重建保真度、增强了解释性，并能用单个特征编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留正负激活值，能够发现更丰富的双向概念表示，解决了现有SAE的结构性限制问题。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ZO Fine-tuner，一种基于学习的零阶优化器，通过紧凑且内存高效的设计自动学习有效的扰动策略，用于大语言模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶方法依赖手工制作的静态采样策略，无法适应模型特定结构。观察到实践中只有少量基础模型及其衍生模型被广泛采用，因此为给定LLM学习一次优化器并在不同下游任务中复用是可行且理想的。

Method: 设计学习型零阶优化器，支持每个LLM一次性训练，通过紧凑设计学习高效扰动策略，将学习到学习(L2L)扩展到基础模型时代。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上的实验表明，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务-模型组合中优于先前的零阶基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了强大的性能和可扩展性，为高效LLM微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化放射学报告生成系统忽视了临床上下文这一关键要素，导致出现时间幻觉等问题，而放射科医生在实际诊断中会充分利用临床背景信息。

Method: 构建了C-SRRG数据集，整合了多视角X光图像、临床指征、成像技术和既往研究等全面的临床上下文信息，并基于最先进的多模态大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，结合临床上下文的C-SRRG方法显著提高了报告生成质量，解决了现有系统的时间幻觉等问题。

Conclusion: 临床上下文对于自动化放射学报告生成至关重要，C-SRRG为临床对齐的自动化报告生成提供了有效解决方案，相关数据集、代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

*Suhyeon Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的插件式框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中逐步优化提示词，解决传统RL微调在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RL的扩散模型微调方法在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面存在局限，而现有的提示词优化方法多为前馈式，未能充分利用强化学习的序列特性。

Method: 训练多模态大语言模型使用RL，基于扩散模型的中间潜在状态迭代更新提示词，实现逐步提示词优化，而不修改扩散模型权重。

Result: PromptLoop在多种奖励函数和扩散模型骨干上有效优化奖励，能无缝泛化到未见模型，与现有对齐方法正交组合，并减轻过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜在反馈融入逐步提示词优化，实现了结构上类似Diffusion RL的方法，同时保留了基于提示词对齐的灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADA是一种样本感知的动态数据增强方法，根据样本对模型优化的动态影响自适应调整增强强度，解决了传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中与模型需求不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法使用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随着模型泛化能力的变化而演变，这种不匹配会降低训练效果。需要根据样本对模型优化的动态影响来调整增强策略。

Method: 通过将样本梯度投影到累积模型更新方向并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差来估计样本影响。低方差样本（稳定影响）增强更强以强调多样性，高方差样本（不稳定影响）增强更弱以保持语义保真度和稳定学习。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来一致改进，包括细粒度任务上+7.3%和长尾数据集上+4.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的动态数据增强方法，能有效适应模型训练过程中的动态需求，显著提升训练效果和泛化性能。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me是一种模块化的RAG数据投毒攻击方法，将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，实现低成本适配新目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为注意力吸引器和焦点区域，吸引器优化用于引导注意力到焦点区域，攻击者可插入检索器语义诱饵或生成器恶意指令。通过经验识别与攻击成功强相关的注意力头子集进行引导。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%（+35.9个百分点，比先前工作提高2.6倍）。单个优化的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 建立了RAG数据投毒的可扩展范式，模块化可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联，为可解释性研究提供信息。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Conclusion: 素描激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous

vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at
https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

<details>

Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么使用排练缓冲区存储样本（可能引发数据安全和隐私问题），要么依赖任务边界信息（在单次数据处理中难以识别），因此需要研究无需排练和任务边界的方法。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，所提方法具有有效性。

Conclusion: 成功解决了在线持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储样本和任务边界信息。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 开发可信赖人工智能需要超越黑盒性能指标，理解模型内部计算。机制可解释性(MI)旨在识别模型行为的算法机制，但其科学严谨性依赖于发现结果的可靠性。

Method: 将可解释性方法视为统计估计器，对最先进的电路发现方法EAP-IG进行系统性稳定性分析，包括输入重采样、提示改写、超参数变化和因果分析中的噪声注入等受控扰动。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上的结果显示，EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和超参数敏感性，对其发现的稳定性提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 基于分析结果，提出一套最佳实践建议，倡导常规报告稳定性指标，以促进更严谨和统计基础的可解释性科学。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

### [233] [Feature Identification via the Empirical NTK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00468)
*Jennifer Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究表明，经验神经正切核(eNTK)的特征分析可以揭示训练后神经网络使用的特征。在两个标准玩具模型中，eNTK显示出尖锐的谱悬崖，其顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索eNTK分析是否能够成为特征发现和检测小模型中相变的实用工具。

Method: 在两个标准玩具模型（叠加玩具模型和模加法单层MLP）上分析eNTK的谱特性，研究其特征空间与真实特征的对齐情况。

Result: 在叠加模型中，eNTK在稀疏和密集状态下都能恢复真实特征；在模算术中，eNTK可用于恢复傅里叶特征族；层间eNTK可将特征定位到特定层；eNTK特征谱演化可用于诊断grokking相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为特征发现和小模型中的相变检测提供了实用的方法。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [234] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了持续学习中神经网络对捷径特征的利用问题，提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)诊断指标来区分真实迁移和捷径特征带来的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征，这些特征与标签只有偶然相关性而无因果关系，会削弱模型的鲁棒性和分布外泛化能力。在持续学习中，捷径特征的影响会持续并加剧，导致模型固守过去的习惯而阻碍新技能的学习。

Method: 提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)诊断指标，包含三个可解释的维度：适应延迟(AD)、性能缺陷(PD)和相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上测试了多种CL方法，并在第二阶段故意引入虚假的洋红色补丁作为捷径特征。

Result: 实验发现CL方法比从头训练基准更早达到准确率阈值(负AD)，但在有捷径补丁的类别上最终准确率略低(正PD)。遮盖补丁后CL方法准确率提高而基准方法略有下降，产生负SFR_rel，表明补丁在此设置中成为了CL模型的干扰因素而非有用捷径。

Conclusion: 捷径特征在持续学习中可能成为干扰而非帮助，CL方法容易固守过去的特征偏好，阻碍新任务的学习。ERI指标能有效诊断这种刚性效应。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文深入分析了基于分类器的质量过滤方法(CQF)，发现虽然CQF能提升下游任务性能，但未必改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力，这是因为CQF也会隐式过滤高质量数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型在混合质量的网络爬取数据上预训练，数据过滤至关重要。CQF方法通过训练二分类器区分预训练数据和小型高质量数据集来过滤数据，但该方法是否真正捕捉到有意义的数据质量概念值得研究。

Method: 分析CQF方法的工作原理，比较CQF过滤后的模型与在通过随机token排列生成的合成数据上训练的模型的行为差异。

Result: CQF虽然能提升下游任务性能，但不会改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力。与合成数据训练模型相比，CQF模型表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了CQF捕捉有意义数据质量概念的观点，表明CQF可能并非理想的数据过滤方法。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVD是一种基于潜在扩散模型的判别性迁移框架，用于源自由域自适应，通过扩散模块在潜在空间中生成源域线索来对齐目标域特征，无需访问原始源数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其判别性迁移潜力未被充分探索。针对源自由域自适应中无法访问源数据的核心挑战，需要一种隐私保护的显式知识迁移方法。

Method: 在源域训练阶段，将每个源特征的标签信息编码到其潜在邻域中，通过高斯先验和扩散网络学习标签一致的表示。在适应阶段，从目标特征的潜在邻域采样，使用冻结的扩散模块生成源域线索，通过InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中，DVD优于最先进的方法。相同的潜在扩散模块还能提升源分类器在域内数据的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用、隐私保护的显式知识迁移桥梁，解决了源自由域自适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了GRPO需要大组规模的传统观念，通过将其重新构建为对比学习形式，提出仅需2个rollout的2-GRPO方法，在性能相当的情况下大幅减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRPO算法需要大组规模以确保训练稳定性，但带来巨大计算开销。本文受DPO成功启发，探索最小化rollout数量的可行性。

Method: 将GRPO重新解释为对比学习形式，建立与DPO的理论联系，提出仅需2个rollout的2-GRPO配置。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但仅使用1/8的rollout数量，训练时间减少70%以上。

Conclusion: GRPO并不需要大组规模，2-GRPO是可行的替代方案，能显著降低计算成本而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

TL;DR: 提出了跨提示基础模型（CPFM）来解决黑盒时间序列域自适应（BBTSDA）问题，利用双分支网络结构和提示学习来克服时空动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒域自适应方法主要针对视觉应用，无法直接应用于具有独特时空特性的时间序列数据，且未探索基础模型在黑盒时间序列域自适应中的潜力。

Method: 构建基于时间序列基础模型的双分支网络，每个分支配备独特提示来捕捉数据分布的不同特征，在域自适应阶段开发提示和输入级别的重建学习。

Result: 在三个不同应用领域的时间序列数据集上，CPFM取得了明显优于竞争对手的结果。

Conclusion: CPFM通过结合基础模型和提示学习，有效解决了黑盒时间序列域自适应问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: 研究比较了LLM推理的两种架构：双模型潜在推理与单模型统一架构。在相同潜在token预算下，联合微调的双模型表现最佳，但单模型统一架构几乎能匹配其性能，表明当前双模型设计主要增加计算量而非显著改善推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM推理应该采用分离模块还是单一模型架构，验证双模型潜在推理中提高通信容量和联合微调是否能改善推理性能。

Method: 在GPT-2和Qwen-3上测试双架构潜在推理，比较增加通道容量(H1)和联合微调学习通信(H2)两种方法，并与单模型统一软嵌入基线对比。

Result: H2表现最强，H1只有适度提升；单模型基线几乎匹配H2并超越H1；扩大潜在token预算未能改善鲁棒性；潜在空间分析显示有限的专业化。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在理论上仍有潜力，但需要能明确塑造潜在空间用于算法规划的目标和通信机制。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

TL;DR: 提出了DAV框架，将扩散对齐建模为变分期望最大化过程，通过E步和M步的交替迭代优化扩散模型，在最大化奖励的同时保持样本多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法虽然能有效最大化奖励，但常面临奖励过度优化和模式崩溃的问题，需要一种能同时保持多样性的方法。

Method: 采用变分期望最大化框架：E步通过测试时搜索生成多样且奖励对齐的样本；M步使用E步发现的样本精炼扩散模型。

Result: DAV在连续和离散任务（文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中都能在优化奖励的同时保持多样性。

Conclusion: DAV框架通过变分期望最大化的迭代过程，有效解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过度优化和模式崩溃问题，实现了奖励优化与多样性的平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型训练范式从静态数据集转向基于经验的学习，需要为LLM代理与复杂环境交互提供标准化框架。

Method: 开发GEM框架，包括环境套件、集成工具和示例脚本，并使用REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization在24个环境中建立基线。

Result: GEM成功支持五种流行RL训练框架，ReBN相比GRPO在完整RL设置中表现更好，提供了PPO、GRPO和REINFORCE在单轮和多轮设置中的基准比较。

Conclusion: GEM框架可以加速未来代理式LLM研究，既可作为训练环境，也可作为评估工具包。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Motivation: 研究差分注意力机制在提高任务相关焦点同时，对对抗性扰动的结构脆弱性问题。

Method: 通过理论分析识别负梯度对齐是敏感性放大的关键驱动因素，并在ViT/DiffViT和预训练CLIP/DiffCLIP上进行系统实验验证。

Result: 实验显示差分注意力具有更高的攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强的局部敏感性，深度依赖实验揭示了鲁棒性交叉现象。

Conclusion: 差分注意力在干净输入上提高判别性焦点，但增加了对抗性脆弱性，需要在选择性和鲁棒性之间进行权衡设计。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

TL;DR: 研究发现前馈网络(FFN)存在光谱利用不对称性：软秩随宽度呈幂律增长，而硬秩仅次线性增长且方差大，表明FFN增宽主要增加低能量尾方向，而主导模式子空间早期饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何利用其潜在空间。本文研究FFN并将宽度选择重新定义为光谱利用问题。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件（硬秩、软秩、光谱浓度和复合光谱利用指数）量化LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT家族中有意义激活的潜在方向数量。

Result: 发现不对称光谱缩放定律：软秩随FFN宽度呈近乎完美的幂律增长，而硬秩仅次线性增长且方差高。在更大宽度下，方差进一步坍缩到狭窄子空间，导致大部分潜在空间未被充分利用。

Conclusion: 将FFN宽度选择重新定义为尾容量与主导模式容量之间的权衡，为推理高效的LLM设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，一种轻量级强化学习算法，通过学习的价值模型选择中等难度提示来后训练语言模型，在推理任务上实现更好的性能与效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练LLMs通过强化学习对批处理和提示选择策略敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练方法。

Method: 使用学习的价值模型在线识别当前策略的中等难度提示，避免昂贵的rollout，通过关注高有效比的信息提示进行训练。

Result: PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现12.1倍和16.9倍的提示识别速度提升，达到最高性能或显著减少达到同等性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL提供了一种新方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了上界性能与效率之间的改进权衡。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种机器学习模型（线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林）在预测预期寿命方面的表现，发现随机森林模型具有最高的预测准确性，并识别出免疫接种率和人口统计学特征为关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测预期寿命对于公共卫生和社会经济发展至关重要，但由于人口、环境和医疗因素的复杂相互作用，这仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 使用来自世界卫生组织和联合国的真实数据集，评估线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林三种机器学习模型，通过R²、平均绝对误差和均方根误差等指标评估性能。

Result: 随机森林模型取得了最高的预测准确率（R² = 0.9423），显著优于线性回归和回归决策树。免疫接种率（白喉、麻疹）和人口统计学属性（HIV/AIDS、成人死亡率）被识别为预测预期寿命的关键驱动因素。

Conclusion: 集成方法与透明度在解决公共卫生挑战方面具有协同作用。未来研究应探索先进的插补策略、替代算法和更新的数据，以进一步提高预测准确性并支持基于证据的全球卫生政策制定。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多目标对齐框架，通过标准化过程奖励模型训练、多动作头DPO和向量化奖励，实现跨可验证奖励、主观偏好和复杂交互场景的同时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将异构信号压缩为单一优化目标，无法同时处理可验证奖励（如数学准确性）、非验证主观偏好（如人类价值观）和复杂交互场景（如多轮AI辅导对话）的多维对齐需求。

Method: 1) 标准化过程奖励模型训练；2) 使用多动作头DPO和向量化奖励进行多目标对齐；3) 提供细粒度推理时用户控制。

Result: 在数学推理、价值对齐和多轮对话实验中，该框架能同时提升多个目标的性能，最小化跨目标权衡，并实现灵活的推理时用户控制。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多目标强化学习中的目标冲突问题，为LLM的多维对齐提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在RL训练中存在秩1主导性和线性动态特性，基于此提出AlphaRL加速框架，可达到2.5倍加速并保持96%以上推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习推动了LLM推理能力的发展，但RL训练期间的参数动态变化机制仍不清楚，需要深入理解。

Method: 识别RL诱导参数更新的两个基本属性：秩1主导性（参数更新矩阵的顶部奇异子空间决定性能提升）和秩1线性动态（主导子空间线性演化），并基于此提出AlphaRL加速框架。

Result: 在8个LLM和7种算法上的实验验证了这些属性的普适性，AlphaRL可实现2.5倍加速同时保持>96%的推理性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为大规模RL提供了通用实用的工具，开辟了面向原则性、可解释性和高效LLM训练的新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究为状态空间模型(SSMs)提供了理论解释，揭示了内存精度与长度之间的权衡关系，证明了初始参数的重要性，并提出固定循环权重可以带来更好性能的训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未能充分解释状态空间模型高性能背后的机制，缺乏对其学习动态的理论理解。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列在状态中的存储方式来评估SSMs的内存容量，建立了结构化状态空间序列模型(S4)与简化对角循环权重S4的理论等价性，并通过实验验证理论发现。

Result: 发现内存精度与长度存在权衡，初始内存结构需要尽可能长，即使可能牺牲精度或梯度信息。固定循环权重比自适应权重能获得相当或更好的性能，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础，并可能提供一种新颖的优化策略，强调初始化的重要性以及固定权重的优势。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: Toucan是一个包含150万条轨迹的大规模开源工具-智能体数据集，基于近500个真实世界MCP环境合成，解决了开源社区缺乏高质量工具-智能体训练数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区在LLM智能体开发中面临高质量工具-智能体训练数据缺乏的问题，现有数据集在多样性、真实性和复杂性方面存在局限，特别是多工具和多轮交互方面。

Method: 利用真实MCP环境生成多样化任务，使用5个不同模型产生工具使用查询，经过质量过滤后使用3个教师模型和2个智能体框架生成轨迹，并通过规则和模型验证确保质量。

Result: 基于Toucan微调的模型在BFCL V3基准测试中超越了更大的闭源模型，并在MCP-Universe Bench上推进了帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集为开源LLM智能体开发提供了高质量的训练数据，显著提升了模型在工具使用任务上的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

TL;DR: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换解决ANNS验证瓶颈，将90%以上信号能量压缩到前半维度，实现早期候选剪枝和部分距离计算，在多种ANNS方法上获得2-30倍端到端加速且无召回损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANNS系统在最终精炼阶段花费高达99%的查询时间计算距离，存在显著的验证瓶颈。

Method: 使用数据自适应学习的正交变换，通过层级主内存布局、SIMD向量化部分距离计算和缓存感知访问模式，无需修改索引即可集成到IVFPQ/Flat、HNSW、MRPT和Annoy等ANNS方法中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GIST、OpenAI Ada 2和Large 3等多样化数据集上的实验表明，PANORAMA实现了2-30倍的端到端加速，且没有召回损失。

Conclusion: PANORAMA有效解决了ANNS系统的验证瓶颈，通过机器学习方法显著提升了查询效率，为大规模向量检索提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

TL;DR: 提出了BroRL方法，通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来扩展强化学习，解决了ProRL方法在数千步训练后性能饱和的问题，实现了持续的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ProRL方法通过增加训练步数来扩展强化学习，但在数千步后性能达到饱和，计算资源投入的回报递减。需要探索补充性的扩展范式来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用BroRL方法，将每个样本的rollout数量增加到数百个，进行充分的探索。通过质量平衡方程分析概率质量变化，理论证明当rollout数量足够大时，能确保正确token概率质量的增长。

Result: BroRL方法成功复活了在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，实现了稳健的持续改进，在1.5B模型上跨多个基准测试达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是扩展强化学习的有效补充范式，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能瓶颈，为复杂推理能力的开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的私有在线学习算法，能够在适应性强敌手下实现O_d(log T)的错误界限，填补了之前研究的空白，并进一步在不可知设置中实现了次线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的私有在线学习研究在适应性强敌手下只能达到次优的O_d(√T)错误界限，而本文旨在填补这一差距，实现与惰性强敌手相同的O_d(log T)最优界限。

Method: 提出了一种新的私有在线学习算法，该算法能够在适应性强敌手下工作，并针对具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类进行优化。

Result: 新算法在适应性强敌手下实现了O_d(log T)的错误界限，同时在不可知设置中获得了O_d(√T)的次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类不仅在可实现设置中可私有在线学习，在不可知设置中同样可学习，且能在适应性强敌手下达到最优错误界限。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型(NWMs)产生的概率降水预报可能存在校准不良的问题，而标准的校准指标如ECE无法有效捕捉不同降水阈值下的校准误差。

Method: 引入了期望阈值校准误差(ETCE)作为新指标，并将计算机视觉中的后处理技术扩展到预报领域，采用选择性缩放和提前时间条件化方法。

Result: 选择性缩放结合提前时间条件化能够在不降低预报质量的情况下减少模型的校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE指标能更好地捕捉有序类别(如降水量)中的校准误差，所提出的后处理方法有效改善了降水临近预报的概率校准性能。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

Motivation: 现有分布鲁棒优化方法仅利用因果图信息设计模糊集，忽略了结构方程信息。为了包含更现实的概率分布，需要同时利用因果图和结构方程来增强模糊集。

Method: 提出结构因果最优传输及其模糊集，引入正则化版本用正则项替代复杂因果约束，通过凸差规划开发高效算法。

Result: 方法能有效克服最优传输问题的维度诅咒，实现维度无关的快速收缩，在结构信息缺失时仍保持有效性并提供有限样本保证。

Conclusion: 结构因果最优传输通过整合结构方程信息显著提升了模糊集的质量，同时保持了计算效率和理论保证。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

Motivation: 在推荐系统等实际应用中，多个学习智能体需要在保证安全约束的同时平衡探索与利用，避免灾难性失败。需要研究分布式网络环境下带保守约束的多智能体协作学习问题。

Method: 提出MA-SCLUCB算法，采用回合制设计，交替进行动作选择和共识构建阶段。智能体仅与直接邻居通信，网络优化全局参数（局部参数的平均值）。

Result: 算法以高概率实现遗憾界$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$，其中d是维度，T是时间范围，|λ₂|是网络第二大特征值幅度。

Conclusion: 分布式学习在合理连接的网络中能实现接近最优性能，协作带来1/√N的改进，通信开销仅对数增长，阶段安全约束仅增加低阶遗憾。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

Motivation: 函数数据的无限维特性使得表示学习具有挑战性，传统统计模型依赖预选基展开或核函数限制了数据驱动的灵活性，而深度学习管道常将函数视为固定网格向量忽略了内在连续性。

Method: 结合双向神经控制微分方程与混合专家驱动的向量场形成连续注意力机制，捕捉函数内连续性；通过多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系变化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界函数回归基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确率，并对函数的任意离散采样观测具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME提供了一个完全数据驱动的函数间回归框架，能够有效处理函数数据的连续性和依赖关系，在准确性和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效、非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，在NanoGPT实验中实现了7倍通信节省且无精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如Muon、Scion和Gluon虽然通过利用层线性最小化预言机(LMOs)在非欧几里得范数球上推进了大规模深度学习，但缺乏有原则的分布式框架，通信瓶颈未解决，且现有分布式变体是启发式的，没有收敛保证。

Method: 提出EF21-Muon，首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和带误差反馈的双向压缩，这是误差反馈在非欧几里得设置中的首次扩展。当压缩关闭且选择特定范数时，可恢复Muon/Scion/Gluon。

Result: 理论覆盖非欧几里得光滑和更一般的$(L^0, L^1)$-光滑设置，匹配已知最佳欧几里得速率，并在合适范数选择下实现更快收敛。实验在NanoGPT上显示，与未压缩的Muon/Scion/Gluon相比，EF21-Muon实现了高达7倍的通信节省且无精度下降。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon为这一强大优化器家族提供了首个高效的分布式实现，解决了通信瓶颈问题，同时保持了收敛性能，为大规模深度学习训练提供了实用的分布式解决方案。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多种机器学习算法在数字发展干预文档分类中的性能，采用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型来优化多分类任务，发现数据量不是唯一影响因素，类内相似性和类间差异性也很关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数字数据库的快速增长，自动文档分类成为NLP的热门话题。但针对特定分类任务训练好的模型在其他数据集上可能表现不佳，需要训练和评估多个模型来优化结果。数字干预领域相对较新，NLP在该领域的应用具有广阔前景。

Method: 使用公开可用的全球数字发展干预文档数据库，包含12个类别。采用多种ML算法（决策树、k近邻、SVM、AdaBoost、随机梯度下降、朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归），使用过采样处理类别不平衡问题，并研究One vs Rest方法来构建优化性能的组合模型。

Result: 使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数评估模型性能。研究发现数据量不是影响性能的唯一因素，类内相似性和类间差异性也是关键因素。

Conclusion: 通过比较多种机器学习算法在数字发展干预文档分类中的表现，证明了One vs Rest方法在多分类任务中的有效性，并强调了类内相似性和类间差异性的重要性，为数字发展组织的报告工作提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合随机过程理论和深度学习，为复杂系统中的生存现象提供基于物理原理的可解释参数化建模方法，不依赖比例风险假设。

Method: 使用神经网络将输入变量映射到首次命中时间过程的物理参数（初始条件、漂移、扩散），基于布朗运动等随机过程建模事件时间。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的预测准确性与最先进方法相当，同时保持了基于物理原理的可解释参数化。

Conclusion: DeepFHT为建模复杂系统中的生存现象提供了原则性途径，结合了随机过程理论和深度学习的优势。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

TL;DR: TD-JEPA是一种基于时间差分学习的潜在预测方法，用于无监督强化学习，能够在潜在空间中训练状态和任务编码器、策略条件多步预测器和参数化策略，实现测试时对任意奖励函数的零样本优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在预测方法通常局限于单任务学习、单步预测或在线轨迹数据，而时间差分学习能够从离线、无奖励的转移中学习预测长期潜在动态的表示。

Method: 提出TD-JEPA方法，利用基于TD的潜在预测表示进行无监督RL，训练显式的状态和任务编码器、策略条件多步预测器和潜在空间中的参数化策略。

Result: 理论上证明理想化的TD-JEPA在适当初始化下避免崩溃，学习捕获长期策略动态低秩分解的编码器；实证上在13个数据集的运动、导航和操作任务中匹配或优于最先进基线，特别是在像素级零样本RL的挑战性设置中。

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过TD学习实现了跨多个策略的长期潜在动态预测，为无监督RL提供了一种有效的表示学习方法，支持零样本奖励优化。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Motivation: 探讨时间序列数据是否适合构建基础模型，分析其在零样本能力和微调性能上的局限性。

Method: 使用预测作为下游任务，评估时间序列基础模型在不同领域数据上的零样本能力，并与专门的小型模型进行对比。

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练领域影响显著，在未见过的真实数据上微调后，性能提升不如参数更少、专门设计的模型。

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的多样性限制了基础模型的有效性，专门的小型模型在特定预测任务上可能更优。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Conclusion: LEAP编码作为图表示学习流水线的强大组件具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM遗忘方法在面对权重量化或微调等后处理操作时遗忘效果脆弱的问题，探索独立于遗忘目标的优化器对鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 分析不同阶数优化器（零阶、一阶、二阶）对遗忘鲁棒性的影响，提出结合一阶和零阶更新的混合优化器方法。

Conclusion: 优化器的选择是影响LLM遗忘鲁棒性的关键因素，降级优化器策略为构建更安全的遗忘系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖发送新消息，但LLM难以可靠整合这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的交互机制来指导LLM进行复杂推理。

Method: 引入in-place feedback范式：用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订版本。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，in-place feedback比传统多轮反馈表现更好，同时节省79.1%的token。在受控环境中的补充分析显示，in-place feedback解决了多轮反馈的核心限制：模型往往无法精确应用反馈到错误部分。

Conclusion: in-place feedback为在推理密集型任务中指导LLM提供了更自然有效的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Motivation: 复杂系统产生的模式多样性对科学和艺术应用很有价值，但参数空间庞大且参数与模式之间存在强非线性映射关系，加上用户对特定模式的期望，使得探索过程面临挑战。

Method: 通过设计选择和实现，让用户以系统无关的方式表达约束条件，在用户感兴趣区域内最大化模式多样性（约束多样性），同时保持全局多样性。

Result: 实现了在样本高效的方式下发现用户感兴趣区域内的模式多样性，支持交互式系统探索。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂系统探索中的挑战，通过约束条件引导探索过程，在保持全局多样性的同时最大化用户感兴趣区域内的模式多样性。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态平衡探索与奖励驱动引导，在不牺牲多样性的前提下增强了利用能力，有效解决了GFlowNets在稀疏高奖励空间中的采样挑战。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot

continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种学习动态引导权重的方法，替代传统的静态权重，以在条件扩散模型中平衡感知质量和分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分类器自由引导(CFG)使用静态权重ω来改善样本感知质量，但往往导致分布对齐变差。需要一种更精确的方法来逼近目标条件分布。

Method: 学习连续函数ω_{c,(s,t)}作为引导权重，这些权重是条件c、去噪起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程样本之间的分布不匹配来实现。

Result: 在低维玩具示例和高维图像设置中，该方法在FID指标上表现出改进。在文本到图像应用中，使用CLIP分数作为奖励函数能改善图像-提示对齐。

Conclusion: 动态学习的引导权重能有效平衡感知质量和分布对齐，在图像生成任务中表现优于静态权重方法。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了曲率感知策略优化(CAPO)方法，通过跟踪和利用二阶几何信息来稳定强化学习中的策略梯度优化，提高LLM推理任务的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在LLM推理中的优化稳定性研究不足，导致需要保守的超参数选择，增加了训练样本需求和计算成本。

Method: 通过形式化考虑二阶几何的策略梯度随机优化问题，提出可计算框架跟踪曲率信息，并设计数据选择干预机制，识别和屏蔽导致不稳定更新的样本。

Result: 在标准数学推理基准测试中，CAPO在激进学习机制下保持稳定更新，仅拒绝不到8%的token即可实现比标准GRPO高达30倍的样本效率提升。

Conclusion: CAPO方法通过曲率感知的优化策略，为LLM推理任务提供了稳定且高效的训练方案，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

### [274] [LLM Routing with Dueling Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00841)
*Chao-Kai Chiang,Takashi Ishida,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LLM路由问题，通过上下文决斗赌博机框架和类别校准微调方法，实现了在用户满意度、模型专业知识和推理成本之间的平衡选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决为每个查询选择最佳LLM模型的问题，需要平衡用户满意度、模型专业知识和推理成本这三个关键因素。

Method: 提出类别校准微调(CCFT)方法，通过对比微调和类别加权学习模型嵌入表示，并实例化FGTS.CDB算法进行路由决策。

Result: 在RouterBench和MixInstruct数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了更低的累积遗憾和更快的收敛速度，比基于通用OpenAI嵌入模型的基线方法具有更好的鲁棒性和性能-成本平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM路由问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过表示学习和理论算法相结合，在实际应用中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私担忧或数据收集限制导致的微观样本中一个或多个属性信息缺失的挑战。

Method: 提出使用掩码矩阵表示缺失值的WGAN训练算法，让模型能够从包含缺失信息的训练数据集中学习。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法成功生成的合成数据与使用完整数据训练的模型以及实际人口数据高度相似。

Conclusion: 为不完整数据的人口合成提供了稳健解决方案，展示了深度生成模型在推进人口合成能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

### [276] [Target Population Synthesis using CT-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00871)
*Tanay Rastogi,Daniel Jonsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用条件表格生成对抗网络(CT-GAN)来生成目标人口，并与传统FBS-CO方法进行比较，发现CT-GAN单独使用效果最佳，但混合模型能结合两者优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定性人口合成方法在处理高维数据、可扩展性和零单元问题时面临挑战，特别是在为目标场景生成人口时。

Method: 使用CT-GAN直接从边际约束生成目标人口，或通过混合方法将CT-GAN与FBS-CO结合。

Result: 单独的CT-GAN模型表现最佳，能生成符合单变量分布的逼真群体，但在保持多变量关系方面有困难。混合模型相比FBS-CO有所改进。

Conclusion: CT-GAN是生成目标人口的有效方法，深度生成模型可以与传统合成技术成功集成以提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

*Jose I. Mestre,Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Cristian Pérez-Corral,Manuel F. Dolz,Jose Duato,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) 是一种新的架构模块，通过分离结构知识和定量知识来替代传统MLP，实现更高效的训练过程，训练时间平均减少约40%，同时保持或超越同等参数规模MLP的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP在训练过程中将结构知识和定量知识纠缠在一起，导致训练效率不高。GLAI旨在分离这两种知识，固定稳定的激活模式结构，只优化数值权重和偏置，从而提高训练效率。

Method: GLAI将MLP重新表述为路径的组合，固定由ReLU激活诱导的稳定激活模式（结构知识），仅优化数值权重和偏置（定量知识）。这种方法保留了MLP的通用逼近能力。

Result: 在多种实验设置下，GLAI平均减少训练时间约40%，同时与同等参数规模的MLP相比，准确率相当或更高，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: GLAI确立了一个新的设计原则，可作为通用模块替代MLP，未来有望集成到Transformer等大规模架构中，这些架构中MLP块占主导计算开销。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Motivation: 研究损失函数在基于值的强化学习方法中的影响，探索不同损失函数如何影响学习策略的性能和次优性差距控制。

Method: 理论分析不同预测目标（平均绝对误差vs均方误差）对策略次优性差距的影响，并实证验证不同损失函数（二元/分类交叉熵损失vs平方损失）在强化学习中的表现。

Result: 理论证明平均绝对误差比均方误差更适合控制策略次优性差距；实证表明基于交叉熵损失的算法在线性强化学习中优于基于平方损失的算法。

Conclusion: 损失函数选择对强化学习性能有重要影响，交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差目标更匹配，能带来更好的学习效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Method: 开发Boruta和mRMR的混合特征选择方法BoMGene，在25个公开基因表达数据集上使用SVM、随机森林、XGBoost和GBM等分类器进行实验验证。

Result: Boruta-mRMR组合相比单独使用mRMR减少了特征数量，加快了训练时间，同时保持甚至提高了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、稳定性和实际应用性方面具有明显优势，适用于多类基因表达数据分析。

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理能力提升有限的问题，原因是过度关注高概率输出序列而忽略了罕见但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出RiskPO方法，使用混合风险价值目标整合奖励分布的多个区域，增强困难实例的梯度信号；设计捆绑方案将多个问题聚合，提供更稳定丰富的训练反馈。

Result: RiskPO在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中均取得显著改进，在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上超越GRPO及其变体。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了严谨有效的范式，理论证明风险规避更新能缓解熵崩溃并促进探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Xin-Qiang Cai,Wei Wang,Feng Liu,Tongliang Liu,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种修正算法（反向修正和正向修正）来解决RLVR系统中验证器不可靠性问题，通过建模验证器为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，有效减少了假阴性和假阳性错误对训练的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR系统为避免昂贵的人工标注而使用自动化验证器，但将奖励二值化会引入假阴性和假阳性错误。现有验证器（如基于规则的检查器或LLM）存在脆弱性，导致正确解被拒绝或错误解被接受。

Method: 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，提出两种修正算法：反向修正通过去偏观察到的二元奖励来恢复无偏策略梯度估计器；正向修正通过重新加权评分函数项使期望更新方向与干净梯度对齐。

Result: 在数学推理模型和基准测试中，两种修正方法均优于未修正训练，其中正向修正收敛更快且在更高噪声下保持稳定。通过轻量级LLM验证器在线估计假阴性率，性能优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的修正算法有效缓解了验证器不可靠性问题，正向修正尤其具有实用价值，为RLVR系统提供了更稳健的训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Result: 显著提升安全性和越狱鲁棒性，减少过度拒绝，保持核心推理能力，同时维持推理token预算

Conclusion: RECAP训练后的模型更频繁进行自我反思，在自适应攻击下保持鲁棒性，即使重复尝试覆盖其推理也能维持安全性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Conclusion: RCM成功地将一致性建模扩展到黎曼流形，为在弯曲几何上的少步生成提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的理论和实践意义

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Conclusion: S-SWIM提供了一种数据驱动、快速、高性能且可解释的SNN训练方法，解决了传统梯度训练方法的困难

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Method: 开发新算法交替进行标签收集和分布估计，计算逻辑分数的保守数据驱动阈值来决定何时需要进行测试。

Result: 算法以高概率不超过目标错误率，且测试次数仅比知道真实参数和特征分布的神谕基线多O(√T)次。

Conclusion: 首次为错误约束下的逻辑测试提供了无悔保证，在医疗筛查等成本敏感场景中有直接应用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

TL;DR: 本文分析了无意义token能提升LLM推理性能的现象，发现这是由于MLP层激活重新分布所致，并提出了激活重分布模块(ARM)来模拟这种效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到在查询提示前插入长序列无意义token能持续提升LLM推理性能，这一现象令人困惑，需要探究其底层机制并开发更原则性的方法。

Method: 提出激活重分布模块(ARM)，这是一种轻量级推理时技术，无需改变输入序列，通过识别非线性函数后的近零激活并将其向外偏移，以受控方式重现无意义token的有益效果。

Result: 在多种基准测试和模型架构上的广泛实验表明，ARM能持续提升LLM在推理任务上的性能，且只需几行简单代码即可实现。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为无意义token的意外益处提供了清晰的机制解释，还开发了一种简单有效的技术，利用激活重分布来进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有课程学习方法未能充分考虑提示难度变化或依赖简单过滤机制，导致计算资源浪费，需要从梯度优化角度系统提升训练效率。

Method: 从强化学习梯度优化理论分析出发，提出CurES方法，通过控制提示采样分布和rollout数量分配来加速收敛，并使用贝叶斯后验估计最小化计算开销。

Result: 在1.5B和7B模型上，CurES分别比GRPO方法提升3.30和4.82个点，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 从梯度优化角度系统分析训练效率影响因素，提出的CurES方法在性能和收敛速度上均优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

TL;DR: 提出了Gated X-TFC方法，通过软学习的域分解解决PINNs在边界层问题中的梯度分辨率不足问题，显著提高计算效率和精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs和相关方法在解决奇异扰动边界值问题时难以解析尖锐梯度，而X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化，但在边界层问题上计算效率低且不兼容域分解

Method: 使用可微分的逻辑门进行软学习的域分解，动态调整RBF核宽度，无需接口惩罚；引入算子条件元学习层学习从PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射

Result: 在1D对流扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配置点，训练时间减少66%；可扩展到多子域和高维问题

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单替代方案，在具有挑战性的边界层区域既准确又计算高效，未来工作将关注非线性问题

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Motivation: 研究如何发现AI模型拥有但故意隐藏的知识，这对于模型安全审计和透明度至关重要。

Method: 训练三类LLMs使其在特定情境下应用秘密知识但直接询问时否认，设计了基于预填充攻击的黑盒方法和基于logit lens和稀疏自编码器的白盒方法进行秘密诱导测试。

Result: 预填充攻击在2/3场景中表现最佳，在剩余场景中白盒方法最有效。多种技术相比简单基线都有改进。

Conclusion: 建立了秘密诱导的公共基准，证明了不同诱导方法的有效性，为AI模型的知识审计提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

TL;DR: 研究发现神经网络回归中的特征坍缩会损害泛化性能，而分类任务中的神经坍缩则有益。通过内在维度分析，揭示了特征维度与目标维度之间的关系对回归性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然神经坍缩在分类任务中被证明有益于泛化，但在回归任务中类似的坍缩现象却会降低性能。本研究旨在解释这种差异，并探索神经网络回归中表示几何的特性。

Method: 通过内在维度分析，估计最后一层特征的内在维度(ID_H)并与回归目标的内在维度(ID_Y)进行比较。在控制任务和合成数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 坍缩模型表现出ID_H < ID_Y，导致过度压缩和泛化性能差；非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。性能与ID_H的关系取决于数据量和噪声水平。识别了过度压缩和欠压缩两种机制。

Conclusion: 研究为神经网络回归提供了新的几何视角，并提出了增强泛化性能的实用策略：根据数据特性和任务需求调整特征维度，避免过度压缩或欠压缩。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型无法处理文本信息，而大语言模型在处理数值时间序列时效率低下且缺乏时间数据预训练，需要融合两者的优势。

Method: 使用基于补丁的编码器-解码器架构增强LLM，在包含200多万个时间序列和文本交错示例的大规模语料库上进行训练，涵盖多种分析任务。

Result: TsLLM在需要结合时间序列分析和自然语言的任务上表现出色，虽然不旨在超越专门模型，但提供了现有方法无法实现的能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的时间序列分析范式，通过自然语言交互连接数值计算和自然语言理解，使复杂的时间推理能力更加普及。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个可扩展且隐私敏感的生物特征系统，适用于分布式环境中的安全有效识别。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR)方法，通过并行生成草稿、蒸馏到有限工作空间、然后精炼的方式，在保持高准确率的同时降低上下文长度和延迟。该方法比长链思维推理效果更好且成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理训练鼓励LLMs生成长链思维，虽然提高了准确率但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和延迟。作者希望探索是否能利用模型的元认知能力找到更好的帕累托边界组合。

Method: 提出PDR方法：1）并行生成多样化草稿；2）蒸馏到有限文本工作空间；3）基于工作空间进行精炼。还研究了并行度为1的特殊情况Sequential Refinement (SR)。同时训练了8B思考模型与RL使其与PDR推理方法一致。

Result: 在数学任务上，迭代流水线在相同顺序预算下优于单次推理基线，PDR带来最大增益（AIME 2024 +11%，AIME 2025 +9%）。PDR实例化比长链思维准确率更高且延迟更低。

Conclusion: PDR方法能够在不增加上下文长度的情况下提升性能，成功展示了模型编排的潜力。同时表明进一步训练可能改变帕累托边界，为LLM推理优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabINR是一个基于隐式神经表示(INR)的表格数据插补框架，使用可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，能够在不修改训练模型的情况下实现实例自适应插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据经常存在缺失值，而简单的插补策略会引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，因此需要能够提供高质量插补、对数据集大小具有鲁棒性且推理速度快的插补器。

Method: 提出TabINR框架，采用自动解码器架构的隐式神经表示，引入可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，可以从部分观察中推断嵌入，实现实例自适应插补。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，显示出持续强大的插补准确性，在大多数情况下匹配或优于经典方法(KNN、MICE、MissForest)和深度学习模型(GAIN、ReMasker)，在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架通过隐式神经表示有效处理表格数据缺失值问题，提供高质量插补，特别适用于高维数据集，展现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机矩阵理论的梯度去噪后处理算法，用于提升差分隐私微调大语言模型的样本效率，在保持隐私保证的同时减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，添加的噪声会破坏梯度矩阵的低秩结构，增加优化难度，降低样本效率。

Method: 使用随机矩阵理论对梯度进行后处理去噪，恢复低秩结构，提高与原始信号的匹配度。

Result: 在GLUE任务上对RoBERTa进行DP-SGD微调时，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，显著减少了达到满意性能所需的训练时间。

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的前提下，有效提升私有语言模型训练的实用性。

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多边际轨迹推断方法ALI-CFM，通过对抗性损失拟合神经参数化的插值曲线，优于现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在只有离散时间点观测数据而无真实轨迹的情况下，建模动态过程并推断潜在轨迹是一个重要但困难的任务

Method: 使用GAN启发的对抗性损失拟合源点和目标点之间的神经参数化插值曲线，确保中间时间点的边际分布接近观测分布，然后通过流匹配算法对插值进行边际化

Result: 在空间转录组学和细胞追踪数据集上优于现有基线方法，在单细胞轨迹预测任务上与基线方法表现相当

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法展示了在多边际轨迹推断任务中的多功能性和可扩展性

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

*Haizhong Zheng,Jiawei Zhao,Bedi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO是一种异步强化学习方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，在高延迟设置下实现稳定的离策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖同策略训练，需要每次更新时生成新的rollout数据，效率低下且难以扩展。异步RL系统虽然解耦了rollout生成和训练，但在处理高延迟数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO（Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization）方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新。该方法在高延迟下显著减少被裁剪token的比例。

Result: 在6个模型（1.7B到32B）和8个基准测试上的广泛评估显示，M2PO即使在数据延迟达到256个模型更新的情况下也能实现稳定的离策略训练，并匹配同策略性能。

Conclusion: M2PO通过适当利用延迟数据，实现了高效的异步强化学习训练，解决了现有方法在高延迟设置下的性能退化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预训练分布的统计特性如何影响大语言模型的上下文学习能力，提出了统一任务选择和泛化的理论框架，并实证验证了预训练分布对ICL性能的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大语言模型中持续有效，但其出现机制仍不清楚。作者旨在阐明预训练分布的统计特性如何塑造ICL能力，以改进模型的可信度和性能。

Method: 开发了一个统一任务选择和泛化的理论框架，将贝叶斯后验一致性和集中性结果推广到重尾先验和依赖序列，更好地反映LLM预训练数据的结构。在随机微分方程和带记忆的随机过程等挑战性任务上进行了实证研究。

Result: 研究表明预训练分布的统计特性（如尾部行为、覆盖范围）直接影响ICL的样本效率、任务检索和鲁棒性。控制预训练分布的关键统计特性对于构建具有ICL能力且可靠的大语言模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 预训练分布的统计特性是塑造大语言模型上下文学习能力的关键因素，通过控制这些特性可以改进ICL的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Fiaingen方法用于金融时间序列数据生成，通过降维空间重叠度、下游任务性能和运行时性能三个标准评估，在保持数据生成时间接近秒级的同时，使合成数据更接近原始时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域机器学习模型需要高质量数据支持投资和交易决策，但现实世界数据在数量、质量和多样性方面存在限制，各种金融资产的数据短缺直接阻碍了交易和投资模型的性能。

Method: 引入Fiaingen技术用于时间序列数据生成，通过三个标准评估性能：(a) 降维空间中真实数据与合成数据的重叠度，(b) 下游机器学习任务性能，(c) 运行时性能。

Result: 实验表明该方法在三个标准上均达到最先进性能，生成的合成数据更接近原始时间序列数据，同时数据生成时间接近秒级，确保方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 使用Fiaingen方法训练的模型性能接近使用真实数据训练的模型，证明该方法能有效缓解金融数据短缺问题。

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Motivation: 尽管归一化技术在深度学习中广泛应用，但其理论理解相对有限。本文旨在建立权重归一化在过参数化矩阵感知问题中的优势。

Method: 使用广义权重归一化结合黎曼优化方法来解决过参数化矩阵感知问题。

Result: WN方法实现了线性收敛，迭代复杂度和样本复杂度随着过参数化程度的增加而多项式级改善，提供了指数级加速。

Conclusion: 这是首个描述WN如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的理论分析工作。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Motivation: 传统示例搜索方法仅优化预测准确率，但忽视了模型校准这一影响可信度和安全部署的关键因素。

Method: 将示例选择建模为多目标优化问题，使用样本高效的组合贝叶斯优化算法(COM-BOM)寻找准确率和校准误差之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 在多个MMLU-Pro基准任务上，COM-BOM在联合优化两个目标方面优于或匹配基线方法，同时需要最少的LLM API调用。

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡预测准确率和模型校准，为可信的上下文学习提供了更好的示例选择方法。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种控制去噪扩散和流匹配模型采样多样性的机制，允许用户从比训练分布更尖锐或更宽泛的分布中采样，无需微调或改变训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在采样时缺乏对分布锐度的控制能力，限制了模型在不同任务中的适应性。

Method: 通过重新缩放噪声数据分布的得分函数来控制局部采样温度，该方法兼容确定性和随机性采样器。

Result: 在图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作和蛋白质设计五个任务中验证了该方法的有效性，能够根据任务需求调整采样分布锐度。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型提供了灵活的采样多样性控制，在不同任务中都能带来性能提升，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)方法，通过将专家分配匹配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，解决了预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE时专家专业化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE的方法虽然能有效增加模型容量，但由于简单的权重复制导致专家专业化不足，表现为低置信度、弱差异化的路由，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入DPSL路由正则化技术，通过匹配专家分配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置。

Result: 在基于Qwen2、Phi3、Llama3.2 LLM骨干的上采样MoE视觉语言模型实验中，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准测试中持续优于其他上采样策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL有效解决了专家专业化不足的关键问题，促进了更具适应性、更高性能的模型，且作为通用工具可应用于任何输出分类概率分布的模块。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

Motivation: 研究非局部守恒定律的数值方法收敛性，特别是当非局部效应消失时，数值解能否收敛到对应的局部守恒定律的熵解。

Method: 采用Godunov型数值离散化方法，结合非局部参数ε和网格尺寸h，通过建立一致的有界性和全变差估计，以及离散熵不等式来证明收敛性。

Result: 证明了离散近似解W_{ε,h}收敛到局部标量守恒定律的熵解，收敛速率为ε+h+√(εt)+√(ht)；对于指数核，还证明了ρ_{ε,h}的收敛性和W_ε的L^1收缩性质。

Conclusion: 非局部守恒定律的数值离散化在适当条件下能够收敛到对应的局部守恒定律的熵解，为这类模型的数值分析提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal conservation laws modeling traffic flows,
given by $ \partial_t \rho_\varepsilon + \partial_x(V(\rho_\varepsilon \ast
\gamma_\varepsilon) \rho_\varepsilon) = 0 $ with a suitable convex kernel $
\gamma_\varepsilon $, and its Godunov-type numerical discretization. We prove
that, as the nonlocal parameter $ \varepsilon $ and mesh size $ h $ tend to
zero simultaneously, the discrete approximation $ W_{\varepsilon,h} $ of $
W_\varepsilon := \rho_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon $ converges to the
entropy solution of the (local) scalar conservation law $ \partial_t \rho +
\partial_x(V(\rho) \rho) = 0 $, with an explicit convergence rate estimate of
order $ \varepsilon+h+\sqrt{\varepsilon\, t}+\sqrt{h\,t} $. In particular, with
an exponential kernel, we establish the same convergence result for the
discrete approximation $ \rho_{\varepsilon,h} $ of $ \rho_\varepsilon $, along
with an $ \mathrm{L}^1 $-contraction property for $ W_\varepsilon $. The key
ingredients in proving these results are uniform $ \mathrm{L}^\infty $- and
$\mathrm{TV}$-estimates that ensure compactness of approximate solutions, and
discrete entropy inequalities that ensure the entropy admissibility of the
limit solution.

Abstract: This paper addresses the numerical solution of the two-dimensional
Navier--Stokes (NS) equations with nonsmooth initial data in the $L^2$ space,
which is the critical space for the two-dimensional NS equations to be
well-posed. In this case, the solutions of the NS equations exhibit certain
singularities at $t=0$, e.g., the $H^s$ norm of the solution blows up as
$t\rightarrow 0$ when $s>0$. To date, the best convergence result proved in the
literature are first-order accuracy in both time and space for the
semi-implicit Euler time-stepping scheme and divergence-free finite elements
(even high-order finite elements are used), while numerical results demonstrate
that second-order convergence in time and space may be achieved. Therefore,
there is still a gap between numerical analysis and numerical computation for
the NS equations with $L^2$ initial data. The primary challenge to realizing
high-order convergence is the insufficient regularity in the solutions due to
the rough initial condition and the nonlinearity of the equations. In this
work, we propose a fully discrete numerical scheme that utilizes the
Taylor--Hood or Stokes-MINI finite element method for spatial discretization
and an implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta time-stepping method in conjunction with
graded stepsizes. By employing discrete semigroup techniques, sharp regularity
estimates, negative norm estimates and the $L^2$ projection onto the
divergence-free Raviart--Thomas element space, we prove that the proposed
scheme attains second-order convergence in both space and time. Numerical
examples are presented to support the theoretical analysis. In particular, the

### [315] [A multi-resolution limiter for the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00511)
*Hua Shen,Bangwei She*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于RKDG方法的多分辨率限制器，通过逐阶比较局部DG多项式的导数与邻域基准值，动态选择最优多项式阶数，避免传统限制器仅检测解的不连续性而忽略导数不连续性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统限制器仅检测解的不连续性，将单元简单分为好单元或问题单元，无法处理导数不连续性。新方法旨在更精细地划分单元，考虑不同阶导数的不连续性，提高数值方法的精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过从高阶到低阶逐次比较局部DG多项式的导数与基于邻域单元平均值的基准值。如果k阶导数大于基准值，则将阶数降至k-1并置零相应k阶项；否则保留k阶多项式。仅当所有导数都大于基准值时，使用TVD斜率限制器重构解。

Result: 数值实验表明该MR限制器具有高精度和鲁棒性，能够根据局部解的光滑性动态选择最优多项式，且具有尺度不变性，这是大多数传统限制器所不具备的特性。

Conclusion: 提出的多分辨率限制器能够有效处理解和导数的不连续性，无需调节问题相关参数，在保持数值稳定性的同时提高了计算精度，适用于一般非结构网格上的双曲守恒律求解。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-resolution (MR) limiter for the Runge-Kutta
discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws
on a general unstructured mesh. Unlike classical limiters, which detects only
solution discontinuities to dichotomize cells into good or troubled, the
proposed MR limiter also takes into account the derivative discontinuities to
divide cells into several groups. The method operates by performing a
successive comparison of the local DG polynomial's derivatives, from high-order
to low-order, against a baseline constructed from neighboring cell averages. If
a $k$th-order derivative of the DG polynomial is larger than the baseline,
  then we reduce the order to $k-1$ and set the corresponding $k$th-order terms
to be 0; Otherwise, the remaining $k$th-order DG polynomial is used to
represent the final solution. Only if all the derivatives are larger than the
baseline, a TVD slope limiter is used to reconstruct the solution. In this
manner, the limiter dynamically selects an optimal polynomial suited to the
local solution smoothness without problem-dependent parameter to tune. Notably,
it also possesses a scale-invariance property that is absent in most classical
limiters. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of the proposed MR limiter.

*Xinyi Guan,Jiayi Hu,Lei Zhang,Shaoqiang Tang,Wing Kam Liu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种时间推进多尺度变分多尺度-张量分解(VMS-TD)算法，用于求解增材制造中移动热源模型的热传导方程，相比传统方法显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增材制造中的移动热源模型需要高效求解热传导方程，传统直接数值模拟方法计算成本高，需要开发更高效的算法。

Method: 采用二阶中心差分进行时间半离散化，将温度场按多空间分辨率分解，每个层次用张量分解表示，采用VMS变分公式获得Galerkin弱形式，并设计VMS-TD算法求解，在尺度界面和移动细尺度子域进行特殊尺度间数据传输。

Result: 数值结果表明多级VMS-TD算法比完全解析的TD算法效率高得多，比传统有限差分或有限元方法更高效，相比多网格方法或GO-MELT框架，三级VMS-TD使用更少的自由度达到准确结果。

Conclusion: VMS-TD算法是求解增材制造热传导问题的高效方法，还提出了多时间尺度扩展版本。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a time-marching multi-level Variational
Multiscale-Tensor Decomposition (VMS-TD) algorithm to solve the heat equation
with a moving heat source model that arises from additive manufacturing. First,
we take a second-order centered difference for time semi-discretization. The
temperature field is decomposed according to multiple space resolution levels,
each represented by the TD method. Then we adopt the VMS formulation [T.J.R.
Hughes, G.R. Feijoo, L. Mazzei, J.B. Quincy. Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg.
166:3-24 (1998)] for the resulting elliptic problem to obtain a Galerkin weak
form, and design VMS-TD algorithm to solve it. Furthermore, to comply with the
TD solution scheme, special inter-scale data transfers are made at the scale
interface and moving fine-scale subdomains. Numerical results demonstrate that
the multi-level VMS-TD algorithm is much more efficient than the fully resolved
TD algorithm, let alone traditional direct numerical simulation methods such as
finite difference or finite element analysis. Compared with the well-known
multi-grid methods or more recent GO-MELT framework [J.P. Leonor, G.J. Wagner.
Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg, 426:116977 (2024)], the three-level VMS-TD
uses much smaller degrees of freedom to reach accurate results. A
multi-time-scale extension of VMS-TD algorithm is also proposed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需迭代的直接方法来解决逆电导率问题，通过变分重构和有限元方法直接从边界测量中识别物体形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于正则化残差最小化的方法需要重复迭代和求解正问题，计算成本高昂。本文旨在开发一种无需迭代的直接方法。

Method: 将逆电导率问题重新表述为涉及正则化残差泛函的最小化问题，然后转化为变分问题，利用有限元方法直接从有限测量中重构物体形状。

Result: 建立了先验误差估计，证明了有限元方法的理论合理性，提供了正则化参数选择准则，并通过数值算例验证了形状重构的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接识别物体形状而无需迭代过程，具有理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: The inverse conductivity problem aims at determining the unknown conductivity
inside a bounded domain from boundary measurements. In practical applications,
algorithms based on minimizing a regularized residual functional subject to PDE
constraints have been widely used to deal with this problem. However, such
approaches typically require repeated iterations and solving the forward
problem at each iteration, which leads to a heavy computational cost. To
address this issue, we first reformulate the inverse conductivity problem as a
minimization problem involving a regularized residual functional. We then
transform this minimization problem into a variational problem and establish
the equivalence between them. This reformulation enables the employment of the
finite element method to reconstruct the shape of the object from finitely many
measurements. Notably, the proposed approach allows us to identify the object
directly without requiring any iterative procedure. {\it A prior} error
estimates are rigorously established to demonstrate the theoretical soundness
of the finite element method. Based on these estimates, we provide a criterion
for selecting the regularization parameter. Additionally, several numerical
examples are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach in
shape reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拉普拉斯方法通常从正向变换开始，该方法反其道而行，先应用逆变换，旨在为各类初值问题提供更高效、精确的符号解。

Method: 假设未知解是辅助函数的拉普拉斯变换，在时域中重新表述问题，通过符号运算递归求解辅助函数，最后对结果应用拉普拉斯变换得到最终解。

Result: 该方法能够构建任意精度的广义对数幂级数符号解，处理复杂项，在各类线性和非线性问题中表现出优越的速度和精度，包括奇异、分数阶和混沌系统。

Conclusion: 新方法为初值问题的符号计算提供了一个强大而灵活的框架，相比经典数值方法具有更高的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-analytical method for solving a
broad class of initial value problems involving differential,
integro-differential, and delay equations, including those with fractional and
variable-order derivatives. The proposed approach is based on the inverse
Laplace transform, applied initially - unlike traditional Laplace-based
techniques which begin with a forward transformation. By assuming the unknown
solution is the Laplace transform of an auxiliary function, the method
reformulates the problem in the time domain and recursively solves for this
function using symbolic operations. The final solution is then obtained by
applying the Laplace transform to the result. This strategy enables the
construction of symbolic solutions as generalized logarithmic-power series with
arbitrary accuracy, and naturally accommodates complex terms. The method is
highly versatile and demonstrates superior speed and precision across a wide
range of linear and nonlinear problems, including singular, fractional, and
chaotic systems. Several benchmark examples are provided to validate the
reliability and efficiency of the proposed technique compared to classical
numerical methods. The results confirm that the new method offers a powerful
and flexible framework for symbolic computation of initial value problems.

TL;DR: 该论文将Carleman线性化方法扩展到无限维希尔伯特空间中的二次非线性动力系统，证明了截断线性化的适定性和收敛性，并分析了离散化后的总误差分解为离散化误差和线性化误差两个独立分量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Carleman线性化在无限维希尔伯特空间中的应用，特别是针对包含常见抛物型半线性偏微分方程（如Navier-Stokes方程和非线性扩散-对流-反应方程）的二次非线性动力系统。

Method: 通过分析Carleman线性化的适定性和收敛性，在适当的假设条件下研究截断线性化，并分析离散化后的误差分解。

Result: 证明了截断Carleman线性化的收敛性，总近似误差可分解为离散化误差和线性化误差两个独立分量，得到了与离散化无关的收敛半径和收敛率。

Conclusion: 验证了Carleman线性化在抛物型PDE问题中的适用性，并支持使用稀疏网格等非标准数值方法来缓解维度灾难问题，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We explore how the analysis of the Carleman linearization can be extended to
dynamical systems on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with quadratic
nonlinearities. We demonstrate the well-posedness and convergence of the
truncated Carleman linearization under suitable assumptions on the dynamical
system, which encompass common parabolic semi-linear partial differential
equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations and nonlinear
diffusion-advection-reaction equations. Upon discretization, we show that the
total approximation error of the linearization decomposes into two independent
components: the discretization error and the linearization error. This
decomposition yields a convergence radius and convergence rate for the
discretized linearization that are independent of the discretization. We thus
justify the application of the linearization to parabolic PDE problems.
Furthermore, it motivates the use of non-standard structure-exploiting
numerical methods, such as sparse grids, taming the curse of dimensionality
associated with the Carleman linearization. Finally, we verify the results with
numerical experiments.

Motivation: 高阶间断伽辽金方法虽然具有指数收敛性和适合现代计算机架构的特性，但由于非局部内存访问和计算步骤成本变化大等问题，实际性能并不理想。本文旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过引入辅助面变量分离单元和面操作，实现数据访问本地化；采用循环融合技术创建单次访问方案；在任务形式化框架下设计执行策略以暴露额外并发性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的执行策略使得强大的多重网格求解算法对更广泛的科学计算实践者变得可访问，无需成为多重网格或复杂离散化技术的专家。

Abstract: Matrix-free geometric multigrid solvers for elliptic PDEs that have been
discretised with Higher-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are ideally
suited to exploit state-of-the-art computer architectures. Higher polynomial
degrees offer exponential convergence, while the workload fits to vector units,
is straightforward to parallelise, and exhibits high arithmetic intensity. Yet,
DG methods such as the interior penalty DG discreisation do not magically
guarantee high performance: they require non-local memory access due to
coupling between neighbouring cells and break down into compute steps of widely
varying costs and compute character. We address these limitations by developing
efficient execution strategies for $hp$-multigrid. Separating cell- and
facet-operations by introducing auxiliary facet variables localizes data
access, reduces the need for frequent synchronization, and enables overlap of
computation and communication. Loop fusion results in a single-touch scheme
which reads (cell) data only once per smoothing step. We interpret the
resulting execution strategies in the context of a task formalism, which
exposes additional concurreny. The target audience of this paper are
practitioners in Scientific Computing who are not necessarily experts on
multigrid or familiar with sophisticated discretisation techniques. By
discussing implementation techniques for a powerful solver algorithm we aim to
make it accessible to the wider community.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable

Motivation: 设计明智的AI政策是社会面临的重大挑战，但目前存在共识形成机制的完全空白。虽然存在证据生成机制和新兴的证据综合机制，但缺乏科学共识形成的有效途径。

Method: 建议NeurIPS借鉴IPCC在气候政策共识形成方面的领导经验，通过开展初步试点项目来主动催化AI政策领域的科学共识。

Result: 论文识别了当前AI政策领域共识形成的缺失，并论证了NeurIPS是最适合承担这一角色的平台，驳斥了AI研究人员分歧过大无法达成共识以及政策参与不是NeurIPS业务的反对观点。

Conclusion: NeurIPS在AI领域的多个前沿都处于领导地位，应该通过促进科学共识来创造更高质量的AI政策。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的兴起，法律判决预测系统开始利用罪犯图像，这可能带来意外后果或被恶意使用，需要评估其效率和公平性。

Method: 使用RAG管道引入法律先例，然后通过创新的微调方案对VLMs进行干预训练。

Result: 发现VLMs在保释预测中表现较差，存在跨多个交叉群体的偏见，且错误拒绝保释的置信度很高；干预措施显著改善了预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在实际部署VLMs进行法律判决预测前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall

Method: 在虚幻引擎的模拟城市环境中，利用具身AI和大型视觉语言模型，使无人机能够动态理解周围环境并决定紧急机动以实现安全降落

Result: 具身AI使得以前无法手工设计的新型自适应恢复和决策流程成为可能

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自主空中系统的韧性和安全性

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

symbolic reasoning conducted by Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(AA-CBR). We explore novel integrations of AA-CBR with the neural component,
including feature combination strategies, casebase reduction via representative
samples, novel count-based partial orders, a One-Vs-Rest strategy for extending
AA-CBR to multi-class classification, and an application of Supported AA-CBR, a

### [330] [Thinkquel: A Model Dedicated to Text-to-dbt Using Synthetic Data and a Span-Aware Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00186)
*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成可靠、可移植且经过执行验证的数据库查询。它集成了TS-SQL合成数据流水线和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，显著提高了查询执行成功率和结果匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠的生产级数据转换具有挑战性：正确性依赖于精确的模式链接和仓库特定的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督信号（执行成功和结果匹配）仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型执行验证语料库成本高昂，令牌级目标与这些全局信号不匹配，导致优化不稳定和可移植性有限。

Method: Thinkquel集成了新颖的合成数据流水线TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，以及专门设计的Token-Sequence GRPO（TS-GRPO）强化学习目标，弥合令牌级训练信号和序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）达到93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配率，相比基础模型分别提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO提高了训练稳定性，并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过创新的合成数据生成和强化学习方法，显著提升了自然语言到SQL转换的性能和可靠性，为生产环境中的数据库查询生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦微调方法，将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，通过专用LoRA适配器分别优化，在本地模型上显著提升了工具调用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为代理编排器需要隐私保护和成本效益的本地推理能力，但本地模型在工具调用场景中表现不佳，特别是在大型工具集选择和复杂参数生成方面。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调为工具选择和工具特定参数生成创建专用适配器，通过分离的损失掩码分别优化两个子任务。提出DualTune推理框架，动态加载相应LoRA适配器生成工具调用，并实现分层编排以限制工具选择数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，在所有情况下都优于相似规模的其他本地推理、非推理和微调模型，在大多数情况下也优于2倍大的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调方法有效解决了本地模型在工具调用中的性能瓶颈，通过任务分解和专用适配器实现了显著的性能提升，为本地设备上的高效代理编排提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

*Maisha Maliha,Dean Hougen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MAGIC-MASK框架，将基于扰动的可解释性方法扩展到多智能体强化学习，通过智能体间协作共享掩码状态信息和经验，提高关键状态发现效率和解释保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习智能体决策过程的可解释性挑战，特别是在安全关键和多智能体环境中。现有方法如StateMask存在计算成本高、探索覆盖不足和缺乏多智能体适应性等局限。

Method: 集成近端策略优化、自适应epsilon-greedy探索和轻量级智能体间协作，通过轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化的统一数学形式化框架。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中验证，包括多智能体高速公路驾驶环境和Google Research Football，在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: MAGIC-MASK通过概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程提供了局部化、可解释的解释，实现了从单智能体到多智能体系统的可解释性泛化。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

### [333] [ICL Optimized Fragility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00300)
*Serena Gomez Wannaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL引导虽然能提升特定任务性能，但会导致跨领域推理能力下降，出现"优化脆弱性"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL引导对跨领域认知能力的影响，特别是推理能力的系统性变化。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的6个变体（1个基线+5种ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上表现下降（谜题准确率降至10-43%，基线为43%），数学奥赛题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL引导在效率和推理灵活性之间存在系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM代理在工具选择中的偏见问题，发现模型会系统性地偏好某些工具提供商或列表中靠前的工具，并提出了轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具市场，如果工具选择存在系统性偏见，会损害用户体验和市场竞争公平性，需要评估和解决这种偏见。

Method: 创建包含多个功能等效工具的基准测试，测试7个模型的工具选择偏见，通过控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露的影响，并提出了过滤候选工具后均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 发现不公平性确实存在，模型要么固定选择单一提供商，要么不成比例地偏好上下文中较早列出的工具；语义对齐是最强的选择预测因素，扰动描述会显著改变选择，重复预训练暴露会放大偏见。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强LLM公平部署的关键障碍，提出的轻量级缓解方法能有效减少偏见同时保持良好任务覆盖。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI在对抗性高风险环境中的关键盲点，即使最先进的模型也难以在存在主动欺骗的情况下做出准确决策，特别是在加密货币等高风险领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估主要在受控环境中衡量任务完成能力，但现实世界部署需要模型具备对抗主动欺骗的韧性。加密货币市场在2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，是测试AI对抗性能力的理想场景。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，在178个时间锚定任务上评估17个模型，要求AI区分真相与操纵、在碎片化信息环境中导航，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆的财务决策。

Result: 无工具时前沿模型准确率仅28%，工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于人类基准80%。模型存在系统性工具选择灾难，偏好不可靠的网页搜索而非权威数据源，即使正确答案可通过专业工具直接获取。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上令人印象深刻，但在需要对抗主动对手的环境中仍基本未准备好。对抗性鲁棒性是可信AI自主性的必要条件，这一发现适用于网络安全、内容审核等多个领域。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme和Maze-Hard任务上实现了比先前报告显著更好的性能

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和有趣的研究方向，表明此类模型仍有很大探索空间

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI智能体通信网络提供了有前景的解决方案，能够支持动态环境下的稳健多智能体协作。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准显示出新开发智能体快速达到性能上限的趋势，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要更可持续和具有挑战性的评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提案挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提案）、问题形成与自由探索（将提案概念化为可行问题候选，智能体自由探索并记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保演化任务具有可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准上的实验表明，TRACE框架能够持续增强任务复杂性，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、人工策划的基准向动态、自我演化评估系统的范式转变，为智能体发展提供了可持续且具有挑战性的跑道。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI健康问答系统的主要方法——专家人工评审——成本高、速度慢，限制了可扩展性。自动评估指标虽然前景广阔，但与人类判断的一致性不一且依赖上下文。

Method: 收集100个患者住院相关问题的案例，从28个AI系统获取2800个回答，从三个维度评估：是否回答问题、是否恰当使用临床记录证据、是否使用一般医学知识。使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为评估基准。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明精心设计的自动化评估可以有效替代人工评审。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS)方法，通过语义丰富的状态表示和动作掩码机制，构建可解释的球员级智能体模型，用于足球等入侵性团队运动的战术分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，而现代机器学习模型往往只进行模式匹配，缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要构建既能从数据中学习，又具有战术可解释性且能跨异构数据源稳健运行的球员级智能体模型。

Method: EDMS方法通过增强原始位置和速度信息，加入关系变量（如空间评分、传球和得分），并结合动作掩码方案，为持球和无球球员提供不同的决策集。

Result: 与基线方法相比，EDMS结合动作掩码持续降低了动作预测损失和时间差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示，EDMS能突出高风险高回报的战术模式。

Conclusion: EDMS方法将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念，使智能体选择与比赛规则保持一致，并实现了跨数据源的可重复实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

Motivation: 传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据。作者希望在不同领域验证这一假设。

Method: 在14个多样化领域中对四种奖励模型变体进行统一评估：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 发现DisORM与DisPRM表现相当，GenPRM不具竞争力，而GenORM在所有测试领域中都表现出显著且一致的增益，是最稳健的模型。

Conclusion: 细粒度监督并不总是更好，生成式结果验证在多领域部署中更具优势，过程评分会因LLM自动标注的标签噪声和长推理轨迹评估困难而受到影响。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}
to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

TL;DR: 提出VIRTUE视觉交互文本图像通用嵌入器，将分割模型和视觉语言模型扩展到表示学习领域，支持用户通过视觉提示指定感兴趣区域，在36个通用任务和5个视觉交互任务上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力来指定用户感兴趣区域，而生成模型已探索此类能力。为嵌入模型添加视觉交互不仅能解锁基于用户意图定位的新应用，还能让模型学习图像中的实体级信息来补充全局表示。

Method: 结合分割模型处理视觉提示以精确定位图像特定区域，使嵌入器能更精确处理复杂和模糊场景。引入大规模分割和场景描述检索基准SCaR，包含100万样本。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将视觉交互能力集成到嵌入模型中，显著提升了处理复杂场景和实体级信息的能力，为表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

*Leopold Müller,Joshua Holstein,Sarah Bause,Gerhard Satzger,Niklas Kühl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了针对RAG系统的数据质量维度框架，通过访谈IT从业者识别出15个跨四个处理阶段的DQ维度，强调需要在传统DQ框架基础上增加新维度，并采取前置质量管理和动态质量监控策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统动态、多阶段的特性，需要开发专门针对这类AI系统的数据质量维度。

Method: 对16家领先IT服务公司的从业者进行半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳推导出RAG系统的数据质量维度。

Result: 识别出15个不同的DQ维度，分布在RAG系统的四个处理阶段（数据提取、数据转换、提示与搜索、生成），发现新维度主要集中在早期阶段，且DQ问题会在管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 需要向传统DQ框架添加新维度以覆盖RAG环境，建议采用前置质量管理和动态、步骤感知的质量管理方法来解决RAG系统中的数据质量问题。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散语言模型(DLMs)在迭代去噪过程中存在关键安全漏洞，攻击者可通过注入肯定令牌绕过安全防护，并提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法来缓解此漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪生成令牌，虽然降低了延迟并支持双向条件化，但其推理机制带来的安全风险尚未得到充分理解，特别是越狱攻击可能利用这一机制。

Method: 研究发现如果在中间步骤出现对有害查询的肯定令牌，后续去噪过程可能被引导生成有害响应。基于此分析，提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明所提方法能显著缓解该漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，同时提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了开展DLM特定安全研究的必要性，扩散语言模型需要专门的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

TL;DR: ACON是一个统一的框架，通过自然语言空间中的压缩指南优化，有效地压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少内存使用并保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在动态真实环境中的部署，代理任务面临上下文长度增长的挑战，导致成本增加和效率降低，而现有的上下文压缩方法主要关注单步任务或狭窄应用。

Method: ACON利用自然语言空间中的压缩指南优化：在完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败的配对轨迹中，LLM分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指南，同时将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小的模型中以减少额外模块的开销。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验表明，ACON减少了26-54%的内存使用（峰值令牌），同时大部分保持了任务性能，在蒸馏到更小的压缩器时保持了超过95%的准确性，并将较小的LM作为长视野代理的性能提升了高达46%。

Conclusion: ACON通过优化压缩指南和蒸馏技术，有效地解决了代理任务中上下文长度增长的问题，显著减少了内存使用并保持了任务性能，同时提升了较小语言模型作为长视野代理的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个自动化科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势，探索假设设计空间，并基于实验反馈学习奖励模型，生成可测试且基于文献的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，以及无法根据先前实验结果进行自适应调整的问题。

Method: 采用受人类研究人员启发的构思流程：文献挖掘识别新兴趋势→探索假设设计空间→通过识别研究缺口和论证设计选择来收敛到精确可测试的假设→基于先前实验结果学习奖励模型。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)方面显著优于基线；与ASD代理CodeScientist配合时，成功执行更多(20 vs 11)，失败更少(16 vs 21)；奖励模型比未训练基线提升约28%。

Conclusion: HARPA代表了AI驱动科学发现领域的重要进展，能够生成更可行、更基于文献的假设，并能根据实验反馈持续改进。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 论文发现当前模型编辑方法存在根本性缺陷，其表面可靠性建立在脆弱基础上，实际是通过利用隐藏捷径而非真实语义来更新知识，在否定查询下会崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型编码的知识可能过时或不正确，模型编辑被认为是更新、删除和遗忘这些知识的重要方法。但作者发现当前模型编辑文献存在虚幻的成功，需要重新审视其基础。

Method: 系统开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负例来测试模型编辑的鲁棒性，揭示了隐藏的捷径利用问题。

Result: 研究发现最先进的模型编辑方法在简单的否定查询下就会崩溃，编辑很可能基于捷径而非完整语义，挑战了当前模型编辑文献的可行性。

Conclusion: 模型编辑可能建立在捷径而非真实语义基础上，在进一步推进之前需要紧急重新考虑模型编辑的基本原理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

TL;DR: 提出CDDM方法，通过协作渐进蒸馏技术将高容量扩散模型的知识转移到轻量级学生模型，实现实时轻量化的轨迹预测，在保持高精度的同时大幅减少参数和采样步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但模型规模大、采样速度慢，阻碍了实际部署。需要开发既能保持高性能又适合实时应用的轻量化方法。

Method: 基于协作渐进蒸馏(CPD)，逐步从教师扩散模型向学生模型转移知识，同时减少采样步骤和模型规模。引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失，结合教师和真实数据的指导，防止过拟合并确保鲁棒性。

Result: 在ETH-UCY行人基准和nuScenes车辆基准上达到最先进预测精度。蒸馏后的CDDM在行人轨迹上保留基线模型96.2% ADE和95.5% FDE性能，仅需231K参数和2-4采样步骤，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟。

Conclusion: CDDM通过桥接高性能生成模型与实用部署约束，为自动驾驶和智能交通系统实现了资源高效的概率预测。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出Expected Attention方法，通过预测未来查询对KV对的关注度来估计重要性，实现训练免费的KV缓存压缩，解决注意力分数不可得的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是大型语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的压缩方法面临未来注意力分数不可得和现代实现中注意力矩阵不完整的问题。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行排序和剪枝，最小化对残差流的影响。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 开发了KVPress库，包含20多种技术，为研究人员实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法提供了全面工具。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as

introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch

loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and

ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于游戏树的指数级增长，许多游戏仍未解决。相关性区域(RZ)技术虽然能显著减少搜索空间，但不同解决方案会产生不同大小的RZ，较小的RZ更有利于重用和剪枝效率。

Method: 设计迭代RZ缩减方法，重复求解同一位置并逐步限制涉及区域；设计三种约束生成策略；集成RZ模式表以充分利用过往解决方案。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，将平均RZ大小减少到原始的85.95%。

Conclusion: 缩减后的RZ可作为可重用知识永久存储，用于未来的求解任务，特别是针对更大的棋盘尺寸或不同开局。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Method: 1. 动态课程学习：从稳定的近策略探索阶段逐步过渡到高效的离策略利用阶段；2. 优势感知自适应裁剪(AAAC)：用动态的样本级边界替代固定裁剪超参数，根据每个token的归一化优势进行调制。

Result: 在MathVista、LogicVista和MMMU-Pro等挑战性多模态推理基准上，ACPO持续优于DAPO和PAPO等强基线，实现了最先进的性能、加速收敛和优越的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了现有策略优化算法的局限性，为复杂多模态推理任务的VLMs对齐提供了更强大和稳定的训练框架。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Conclusion: 数据增强流水线有效提升了定理证明模型的鲁棒性，EvolProver在多个基准测试中超越了同类规模模型，包括基于推理的模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Method: 提出DDIM反演攻击(DIA)，直接攻击DDIM轨迹路径，与迭代去噪轨迹对齐以提高破坏效果。

Result: DIA在各种编辑方法上均能有效破坏图像编辑过程，性能超越AdvDM和Photoguard等现有防御方法。

Conclusion: DIA框架为行业和研究社区提供了实用的AI恶意使用防御方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究加权知识库和c-representations这两种处理不一致知识库的形式化方法之间的语义关系，探索它们之间的等价性和可表达性。

Method: 通过语义层面的比较分析，研究加权知识库（为知识库中的每个语句分配权重）和c-representations（为违反条件分配惩罚值）在解释排序和语义结构上的等价条件。

Result: 证明在特定条件下，加权知识库和一组可废止条件可以生成相同的解释排序，实现语义结构的相对成本等价。同时比较了两种形式化中的蕴涵关系，发现某些概念在两种形式化中等价可表达。

Conclusion: 研究结果为成本语义学和c-representations的进一步工作提供了有益的基础，揭示了两种方法在语义层面的深刻联系。

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督评估分类器的逻辑框架，通过分析分类器之间的一致性和分歧来计算逻辑一致的群体评估，并构建了无需知识的警报系统来检测LLM评委是否违反用户设定的最低评分阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分类器之间一致性与分歧在评估中的不对称性，当专家意见一致时无法排除任何可能的评估结果，而当意见分歧时则能确定至少有一方错误。

Method: 将分类器对齐决策的统计摘要作为线性规划问题的输入，在整数空间中计算可能的正确或错误响应，利用不等式约束和适用于所有有限测试的线性等式公理。

Result: 开发了基于纯逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法，能够构建无需知识的警报系统来监控LLM评委的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了仅通过逻辑一致性进行无监督评估的实际效用，能够有效检测LLM评委是否违反预设的评分标准。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源（特别是可再生能源）的日益集成，电力系统保护面临重大挑战，传统基于固定阈值的保护方案无法在动态条件下可靠识别和定位短路故障。

Method: 使用电压和电流波形，将其分割为10毫秒到50毫秒的滑动窗口，在现实的实时约束下评估经典机器学习模型。

Result: 最佳故障分类模型F1得分达到0.992±0.001，最佳故障定位模型R2达到0.806±0.008，平均处理时间为0.563毫秒。

Conclusion: 机器学习为电力系统保护提供了有前景的替代方案，本研究为模型和设置的比较提供了系统基准。

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Motivation: 加密货币市场中Pump and Dump操纵事件的稀缺性导致严重的类别不平衡，阻碍了准确的检测。

Method: 应用合成少数类过采样技术(SMOTE)，并评估先进的集成学习模型来区分操纵性交易行为与正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提高了所有模型检测P&D事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的高召回率，具有强F1分数和快速计算性能。

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法结合可显著改善操纵活动的早期检测，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型数量的激增，如何高效管理和利用这些庞大资源成为重要挑战，需要学习紧凑的模型能力表示来支持下游任务。

Method: 使用项目反应理论框架，将模型正确回答查询的概率建模为三个因素的函数：模型的多技能能力向量、查询的区分度向量和查询难度标量，并采用混合专家网络联合学习这些参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在模型路由和基准精度预测方面达到了最先进的性能，学习到的参数能够编码有意义且可解释的模型能力和查询特征信息。

Conclusion: 基于IRT的方法能够有效学习LLM能力的紧凑表示，为模型管理和性能预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的评估表明，AIDE能有效识别数据转换和模型，揭示有趣的数据模式。

Conclusion: AIDE为自动化知识发现提供了可扩展的基础框架，未来可集成更多模式提取策略和领域知识。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将不同模态对齐到共享空间，忽视了特定模态的独特贡献，特别是在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 提出FusionAdapter，包含适配器模块实现各模态对未见关系的高效适应，以及融合策略在保持模态特定特征的同时整合多模态实体表示。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的大量实验表明，FusionAdapter在少样本关系学习任务上优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合来自不同模态的信息，FusionAdapter能够以最少的监督改进对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习（AIL）方法虽然有效，但通常被认为不稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计的改进，而奖励分配函数在影响训练动态和最终策略性能方面的作用被忽视。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架，在奖励分配函数空间中进行高效探索，基于模仿策略的性能直接发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法中表现出强大的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL通过自动发现的奖励分配函数实现了更稳定的训练，为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的分离方法在生成切割时多样性不足，产生比预期更少的切割，需要提高模型对生成子集的敏感性。

Method: 1. 在图粗化过程中引入随机边选择替代贪婪方法；2. 提出GraphCHiP算法，利用粗化历史识别RCIs和首次识别FCIs。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上验证，相比现有神经分离方法能有效减小对偶间隙，并在特定实例上发现了有效的FCIs。

Conclusion: 通过测试时搜索增强训练模型的方法能够提高切割生成的多样性和质量，特别是在识别具有挑战性的FCIs方面表现出色。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital

modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

*Saravanan Venkatachalam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个售后需求预测和监控的实用架构，结合了统计、机器学习和深度学习模型的收入感知集成方法，并包含面向角色的分析层，用于生成记分卡和趋势诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决售后需求预测中的复杂挑战，包括处理外生信号、COVID-19影响、长尾商品预测，以及为规划者和高管提供可操作的业务洞察。

Method: 使用帕累托感知分割对高收入商品单独预测，长尾商品通过聚类预测；采用水平感知集成方法，结合统计、机器学习和深度学习模型；嵌入LLM生成角色化叙述和执行质量检查。

Result: 系统能够生成国家-零件级别的预测，提供校准区间，并通过性能记分卡提供决策洞察，包括准确度阈值、偏差分解、地理和产品系列热点分析等。

Conclusion: 该架构实现了从"当前准确度如何"到"准确度趋势和应采取哪些措施"的转变，在90多个国家和约6000个零件上完成了预测、监控和库存决策的闭环。

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究专注于发现特定特征的特定几何结构，缺乏通用性，需要一种模型无关的方法来自动发现特征流形。

Method: 引入监督多维缩放(SMDS)方法，以时间推理为案例研究，自动发现特征流形的几何结构。

Result: 发现不同特征形成多种几何结构（如圆形、直线、簇群），这些结构稳定反映概念属性、支持模型推理，并能随上下文动态重塑。

Conclusion: 特征流形在语言模型中具有功能性作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，语言模型编码并转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了70多个不同架构的LLM在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而现有基准测试无法充分衡量这种表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的快速发展带来了多样化的计算要素，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示能力的模型最为关键，且现有基准测试不适合衡量人类与模型之间的表示对齐。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估了70多个在计算要素上广泛变化的模型，比较人类和模型的概念表示。

Result: 发现经过指令微调的模型和具有更大注意力头维度的模型与人类表示最为对齐，而多模态预训练和参数大小对齐影响有限。现有基准测试中只有部分能捕捉表示对齐，但都无法完全解释对齐分数的方差。

Conclusion: 指令微调和注意力头维度是推进LLM成为人类概念表示模型的关键计算要素，同时揭示了当前LLM评估中基准测试的不足。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭与遮挡部分对应的模型组件来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，从而获得更鲁棒的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的黑盒可解释性方法依赖遮挡输入部分生成的突变体，这会产生分布外图像，影响解释质量，且选择合适遮挡值需要领域知识。

Method: 引入ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式，无需额外训练或微调。

Result: 实验显示AD解释的鲁棒性相比基于遮挡的解释提高了高达62.5%，且无需领域知识。

Conclusion: ConvAD能够提取更鲁棒的解释，且不改变网络的决策过程。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT提示生成的推理轨迹在模型可解释性中的忠实性问题，超越启发式解释走向形式验证

Method: 利用Curry-Howard对应关系，将自然语言的CoT步骤提取并映射为形式化的类型证明结构

Result: 成功将CoT轨迹转换为良好类型证明，作为计算忠实性的强可验证证书

Conclusion: 该框架提供了将可信叙述解释转化为形式可验证程序的方法论，为构建更可靠可信AI系统提供路径

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SIRL方法，利用LLM内在的安全信念作为奖励信号进行强化学习，无需外部验证器即可实现有效对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM安全对齐面临缺乏通用标准和可靠内容验证器的挑战，难以获得有效的训练信号

Method: SIRL方法将模型内部的安全置信度转化为自生成奖励信号，通过强化低熵拒绝行为来教导模型信任其安全本能

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，SIRL对20+种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个无标签提示即可超越资源密集的监督方法

Conclusion: 有效的对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、鲁棒AI安全机制开辟了道路

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中如何同时优化运营效率和劳动力公平性的问题，将机器能力、处理时间、交货期等运营约束与工人偏好、经验、韧性、医疗限制等人本因素整合到生产规划中。

Method: 第一层使用约束规划(CP)进行订单-产线分配，生成高利用率的生产计划；第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行工人-产线分配，整合人本因素。比较了贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种解决方案策略。

Result: CP调度方法产生紧凑、可行的生产计划，延迟率低；MDP工人分配显著提高了公平性和偏好匹配度。领域专家认为两个组件都有效，并提出了改进建议。

Conclusion: 结合CP与基于学习的决策制定为人本生产规划提供了稳健方法，能够同时优化吞吐量和劳动力福祉，为工业环境中的公平高效制造调度提供了实用基础。

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Motivation: 开发一个安全、可审计且低延迟的临床咨询系统，通过专科专家模型提高诊断准确性，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 扩展紧凑的PRISM序列模型为路由式专科专家家族，使用轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分配到专科模型，每个专科继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实世界急诊科队列中，专科模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高质量路由和大量计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模安全、可审计和低延迟的临床咨询提供了实用路径，并概述了满足前瞻性临床部署标准的验证步骤。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂、多模态的金融风险数据时存在困难，标准的检索增强生成方法过于简化关系，而专业模型成本高且静态，需要一种轻量级解决方案。

Method: 将供应链网络建模为知识图谱，使用网络中心性评分指导图遍历提取关键风险路径；采用智能体架构协调图检索、数值因子表和新闻流数据；引入"上下文外壳"模板将原始数据转换为自然语言描述。

Result: 该方法能够实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述，无需昂贵的微调或专用图数据库。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了LLM在金融风险分析中的局限性，提供了一种轻量级、高效的供应链风险分析解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

Motivation: 旨在证明通过精心设计的训练方法而非单纯扩大模型规模，可以在有限计算资源下实现前沿的多模态推理能力，使资源有限的组织也能获得高性能模型。

Method: 采用渐进式三阶段方法：1)深度扩展推理能力；2)分阶段持续预训练，先建立基础文本和视觉理解，再通过合成数据增强视觉推理；3)高质量文本监督微调，包含显式推理轨迹。

Result: 在Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index上获得52分，与DeepSeek-R1-0528相当但计算资源需求更少；在10个图像基准测试中平均性能与Gemini-2.5-Flash和Claude Sonnet-3.7相差不到5分。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis

DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，多个响应独立生成，浪费了计算资源和响应间的潜在有用信息，而响应长度扩展则能利用过去计算。

Method: 提出Bridge方法，将批量LLM隐藏状态视为整体张量而非独立切片，仅添加少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%），实现并行生成相互依赖的响应。

Result: Bridge将基于可验证奖励的强化学习的相对平均准确率增益提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。一次训练即可扩展到任何生成宽度，性能优于独立生成。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了一种更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间信息，兼容任何后生成聚合技术。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.
