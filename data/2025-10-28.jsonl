Although data-driven techniques\nhave emerged to address these shortcomings by augmenting classical models with\ncorrection terms, most existing research has concentrated on two-dimensional\n(2D) cases. Therefore, the performance of these corrected models in complex\nthree-dimensional (3D) flows remains an underexplored area. This study\naddresses this gap by enhancing a data-driven turbulence model, the SST-CND\n(shear stress transport-conditioned) model, which was originally trained on 2D\nseparated flows. An additional correction term, \\b{eta}_3D, is introduced to\naccount for 3D effects. The distribution of this term is initially determined\nthrough a 3D field inversion process using high-fidelity data obtained from the\nflow around a cube. An explicit algebraic expression for \\b{eta}_3D is then\nderived through symbolic regression and formulated to degrade to zero in 2D\ncases. This new expression is integrated into the original model, resulting in\nthe SST-CND3D model. The performance of the SST-CND3D model is evaluated across\na range of flows. In 2D flows, including the separated flow around a hump, flow\nover a flat plate, and flow around a multi-element airfoil, the SST-CND3D model\nperforms identically to its 2D-trained predecessor. However, the model exhibits\nsuperior performance in 3D flows, such as the flow around a cube and the\ncomplex, real-world JAXA standard model high-lift configuration. These findings\nindicate that a sequential correction approach, constructing a 3D correction\nterm that vanishes in 2D on top of a 2D-trained model, constitutes a promising\nmethod for developing data-driven turbulence models that maintain accuracy in\n3D while preserving their effectiveness in 2D."}

Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent\nrandomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and\nrarely achieve consistently optimal results.

PACR encodes\nthe inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the\nprobability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.\nWe provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive\nbias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically\nsound reasoning.

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field.

Defending against novel jailbreaks\nrepresents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract\nand compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with\nLLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates.

Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal\nRelational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures\nbetween multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely\nunder-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on\nsuch data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge\nthe dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement\nmethodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An\nautomatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build\nmulti-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for\nvarious STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement\ntraining framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to\ndifferent STAR tasks.

This\nmeans potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling\nfaces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be\nconditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence\npredictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often\ncluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.\n  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our\nmethod identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from\nconflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy\nboth independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved\nparallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.\n  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy\nand compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially\nfor generation of longer sequences.

However, real-world datasets often suffer from the\nproblem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is\nmissing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods\ntypically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep\nneural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across\nmodalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a\nlow-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible\nmultimodal survival prediction.

To realize\nincomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for\ncross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we\nmodel and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible\nstructure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow\nmodel, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent\nspace of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the\nreconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight\nTransformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating\nthe overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the\nlow-rank Transformer.

To better understand and compare\nheterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable\ntoolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or\nagent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how\nhumans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents\nexhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an\noverwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for\nopen-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the\nUI-centric methods typically used by humans.

Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate\ntechnical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the\nlack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for\nestimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically\ncomputer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed\nmethodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning\nalgorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from\nhigh-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed\nanalysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and\nunderstanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges\nassociated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud\nplatform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently\nmanages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid\nanalysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the\ncity scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an\nindustrial township.

This application, designed for both native Toto\nspeakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring\naccessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured\nlanguage corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation\ncollected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,\ntrilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a\nTransformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional\nmorphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood\ndistinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect\nword-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also\ndeveloped to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for\npreserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic\nmethodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological\ninnovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for\ncommunity-based language revitalization."}

However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process\nin those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based\noptimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.\nAs a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep\nseparately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)\noptimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,\nenabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation\nthrough the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to\nmonitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if\ndesired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which\nconvergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to\nempirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.\nWe demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two\noptions: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given\nimage), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source\nimage while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves\nstate-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function\nevaluations (NFEs) as existing methods.

Prior work\nprimarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather\nthan visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by\namplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.\nHowever, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where\nattention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and\nneglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without\nadjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect\nareas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided\nCross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual\nsaliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or \"gaze\nshifts\", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify\nattention to both salient visual information and the user query at each\ndecoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant\ntokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for\nwell-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT\neffectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and\nclassification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,\nwhile maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational\noverhead."}

We\nevaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\\% human-validated\naccuracy\\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\\% on a dataset generated by recent work.\n% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,\nmodels learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6\nquestion types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\\%\non BDD and 37.9\\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all\nquestions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as\nBLINK.

The key challenge is to balance the potential\ntradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves\nforgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's\noriginal performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use\nmulti-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and\nutility preservation objectives.

This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling\nMachine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these\ncritical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial\nIntelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the\nuncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as\nopposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby\nempowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from\noverconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.\n  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network\n(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief\nfunctions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty\nthrough the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including\nits adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather\nclassification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a\nunified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers.

Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on\nimportance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative\ngradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the\nimportance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs\nsubstantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

Image watermarking for diffusion\nmodels, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as\nspecific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the\ninfomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the\ngeneration process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing\nthe watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to\nbalance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve\nstrong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which\ndegrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile\nfor real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a\ntwo-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS).

Typically, existing graph prompting\nstudies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to\nnode features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve\nsuboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of\n*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the\ngraph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph\nprompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**\n**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively\nadapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we\nreformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within\nmulti-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space\nthrough reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph\nsparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training\nstrategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on\nmultiple node classification datasets.

A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable\nDiffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A\nkey concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether\na particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an\nefficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This\nmethod is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the\naggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise\nprediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and\nnon-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we\nsuppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around\na certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises\nof non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain\ntime step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires\nfewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the\nimage under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation\ndegree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings\nindicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple\ndatasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in\nASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the\nscalability of our method."}

Recent studies have\nshown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve\ndistillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires\nmultiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,\nwe propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that\ngenerates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single\nteacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we\nintroduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle\ndiversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving\nproximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,\nwhich encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The\nensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original\nteacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate\nthat our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby\nreduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more\neffective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an\nexisting knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,\nthe proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play\nfashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance."}

This innovative method\ncomprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation\nparadigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware\nPrediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the\ndata imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During\ninference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual\ninformation to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view\ndata. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\\% Recall@1 on\nUniversity-1652 while being over $5 \\times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3\n\\times$ faster than previous top methods.

However, existing\nbenchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without\ndirectly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical\nbecause without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot\ngenerate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we\nintroduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting\nanswers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we\npropose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized\nQuestion Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized\nintents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer\nselection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting\ntheir acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains\nthrough systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality\ncontrol combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental\nevaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems\nstruggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts.

If\neach expert achieves internal regret $\\tilde O(T^\\alpha)$, then \\algname{M-LCB}\nensures overall regret bounded by $\\tilde O\\!\\Bigl(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{KT}{M}} \\;+\\;\n(K/M)^{1-\\alpha}\\,T^\\alpha\\Bigr)$.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees\nwhen multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round\nbudget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:\n(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts\nthat are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how\n\\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic\nscenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited\nresources."}

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph\ndiscusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,\nand diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between\narbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded\nunderstanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning\nknowledge."}

We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework\nthat separates the observation and denoising space.

We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how\nMLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed\nthrough shuffling.

To\naddress this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning\nincrease tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses\ntool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as\namplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams.

The key challenge is to balance the potential\ntradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves\nforgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's\noriginal performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use\nmulti-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and\nutility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only\nguarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which\ncauses under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first\nmodel MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the\nunlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility\nloss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to\nunilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the\nadditional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an\nimplicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the\naforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,\nthereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU.

Third, within this framework we\nidentify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD\noutperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both\nlinear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning\ndominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal\ncomponents of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a\ngrowing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further\nshow that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive\nstep-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,\nwe show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our\ntheoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets.

We validate ReLNs' versatility\nacross a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic\nbenchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a\nLorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with\ngeometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,\nyielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a\npractical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries\non Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:\nhttps://reductive-lie-neuron.github.io/"}

Although existing methods\ndemonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their\neffect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains\nlargely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on\nlong-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in\nmodern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more\ncomputation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\npruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with\nperformance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when\nperformance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.\nFurthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to\nrecover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated.

At first glance, these approaches may appear quite\ndifferent--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient\nfilter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer\nproducts of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when\nboth constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares\n(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large\nextent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction\nterm introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it\nensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby\nsimplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this\ninterpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by\nreinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure\ntensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly\nfrom quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and\nnon-angular tessellations.

To further examine the influence of Moir\\'e patterns on deepfake\ndetection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\\'eFake,\nreferred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\\'e generation techniques.\nAcross 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\\'e artifacts\ndegrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\\'e\npatterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\\'eing methods,\nintended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing\naccuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for\ndetection models that can robustly handle Moir\\'e distortions alongside other\nrealworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By\nintroducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the\ngap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection."}

Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific\nlong-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity\nand complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical\nneeds. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4\nAPI-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model\nachieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive\ncontext windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter\nlength of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in\ntheir ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and\nhighlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context\nunderstanding."}

However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is\noften inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of\nfaithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to\nthe RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved\nvision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information\ninto its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual\ninformation. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by\nmeasuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts\nare intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged\nunder visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,\nindicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze\nvisual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that\nquantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability\nand sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current\nMCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component\nCause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate\nsufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of\nleading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free\nand compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness\nacross a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

Although the paradigm is effective for\npre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between\npre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts\npre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable\nprompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph\nprompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,\nthey often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In\nfact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations\nacross demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains\nbiases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we\npropose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness\nfor adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks.

One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate\ntemporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional\nkeyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it.

Through symbolic\nprompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and\nself-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or\nmodality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial\ncontext, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type\nclassification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling\nis a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.\n  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability\narises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from\narchitectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to\nmulti-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future\ngenerative EO foundation models."}

To\naddress this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning\nincrease tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility.

However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the\nimportance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs\nsubstantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,\nconditioned on clinical context and preceding text.

The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score\nperformance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a\nnotable reduction in training time to only 44%.

In recent years, a wide range of solutions have\nbeen proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,\nincluding Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,\nand specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for\nsystematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on\nthe assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In\nfact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent\nmodels, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but\nare difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in\nthe field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce\nNoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires\nmodels to go beyond path-based reasoning."}

However, naively performing all computations in low\nprecision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed\nprecision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use\nlow-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their\nsuccess, these principles are currently not reliable for training\ncontinuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations\n(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for\nneural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation\nscheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.\nOur scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,\nparameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while\nstability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating\nthe solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two\nkey challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated\nnetwork evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of\ntime steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,\nopen-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading\npackages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the\nreliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on\nneural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,\nachieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while\nmaintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training."}

However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate\ntemporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional\nkeyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This\ntransforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model\ncontinuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio\ncues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also\nenables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead\ntarget, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the\ntemporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity\nand consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while\nsmaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human\nanimation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,\nidentity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal\nconditioning across several different architectures.

We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal\ninteractions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and\ninteraction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of\nineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions\nfor a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.\nExisting methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning\nprocess, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,\nespecially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.\nTo cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which\ncontains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and\nlink history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information\nthrough transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA\nprevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being\nforgotten.
