These computational demands are further increased\ndue to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal\nhyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the\ngrowing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently\ngained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a\nsubset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,\nreferred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original\ndataset.

This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic\nreinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,\ncapable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool\nresponses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step\nreasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by\ncaching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent\ntraining without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,\ninconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling\nsystem, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal\nfeasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level\nverifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,\nenabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply\naugmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically\nreplay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We\ndeploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct\ncomprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel\nenables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing\nfrontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks."}

This bottleneck is substantial; for\ninstance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of\n4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's\nweights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or\neven improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,\nOjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require\ncomplex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in\ndynamically tracking context shifts.

In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning\nfollowed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level\nconcept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare\npost-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)\nacross pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply\nCRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of\nlearned concepts.

We\npropose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key\nstages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy\nlearning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature\nlearning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$\nacross layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima\ninduced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they\nchange on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we\nprovably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on\nmissing features that need to be learned.

This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the\neffective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a\ngiven task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation\nof each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors\ndistance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,\nthereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence\npoints where these deviations first become significant by tracking this\ndeviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline\nof internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where\nthe reasoning chain begins to go off-track.

Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves.

A\nPathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs\nfrom the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation\nmodule is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance\npathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively\nlearn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant\ninformation, achieving efficient brain graph learning.

While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand\ngeometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and\nstruggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image\nsuper-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.\nThese methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed\nresolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this\npaper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing\ndetailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution\nimages. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with\nexplicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit\nimage function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse\ninput images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D\nhand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among\nupsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,\nnails).

However, existing symbolic regression methods\noften use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only\nconsiders the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical\nstructure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the\ndiscovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or\ninterpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that\nphysical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation\nprecision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats\nformulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures\nand identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant\ndigits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.\nWe find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality\nof models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world\nphysical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression\nalgorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the\nirrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based\nalgorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving\nsample efficiency by 2~4 times.

However, both of\nthese approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many\ndemonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.\nMapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter\nparameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored\ngenerating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need\nto integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce\nCompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter\nparameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be\nmerged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved\npassages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.\nCritically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,\nrobustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution\nwhen input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes\ninformation into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery\nof input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical\nresults on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show\nthat CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when\nscaling to more inputs.

In this work, we posit\nrelevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and\nmeasuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as\ncore legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the\ngap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark\nfor safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with\nlegal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively\naligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks.

However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant\nchallenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing\ndiversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward\nprompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged.

We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training\nwith the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree\nReward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of\nthe draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;\n(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that\ncontrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming\ndebiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along\nthe longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that\nincreasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and\nspeedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and\nmultiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and\nyields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt.

In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes.

Our findings confirm that\nlegal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below\n50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on\ngeneral-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields\nmore stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt\nsensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across\nlanguages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a\nlanguage and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is\nweaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24\npercentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,\nchallenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal\napplications."}

Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL\nmodels: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand\nsubstantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive\ndatasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased\ndue to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal\nhyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the\ngrowing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently\ngained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a\nsubset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,\nreferred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original\ndataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing\nrandom sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of\nthe original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias\ntowards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has\ninter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class\ndiversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,\nlightweight mechanism for coreset selection.

We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology\nby conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical\nimaging dataset.

Most\ncurrent methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which\nsamples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and\nadjusts the policy accordingly.

To\naddress this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in\nRLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G\napproaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture\nembeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate\ndirectly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.\nEvaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive\nlanguage tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements\n(5--35 \\% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the\nQwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of\ntrajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency.

Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped\nregion to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,\nwe develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning\nframework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach\ndelivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with\ngreater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*\nbenchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a\n3x inference speedup.

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an\nartifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a\nsynthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear\nrelational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure\nsubstantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen\nreverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key\nrole in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this\nstructure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically\ndependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only\nsuffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further\nintroducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a\nrelational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal\nrepresentations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent\nmanner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends\ncritically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying\nrepresentational geometry of the knowledge being modified."}

Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic\nreasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other\nadvanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,\nwhere an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,\nbut is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that\ncontain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively\ncollect that information using tools.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear\nattention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant\nper-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks\nthat require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,\nbecause all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent\nstate. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated\nwith the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent\nstates results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a\ntraining pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs\nthrough post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and\nstate space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to\nscale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.\nExperiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently\nenhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring\nhigh post-training costs or compromising other capabilities."}

Project page:\n  https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/vista/projects/2025_bmvc_dipsy/", "summary": "Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited\navailability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating\nsynthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require\nextensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel\ntraining-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for\nimage-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images\nusing only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key\ninnovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables\nindependent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class\nsimilarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive\nexamples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model\nfine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or\ncomparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model\nadaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image\nfiltering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image\nprompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative\nfeatures, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks."}

Among them, next scale\nprediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated\nremarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,\nwe revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a\nMarkovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete\ndiffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with\nDiscrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR\ntransformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how\none can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative\nrefinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster\nconvergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.\nAcross multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR\nleads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation."}

Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend\nit to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL\nformulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We\nfurther show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including\nGRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit\nweighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a\npreviously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our\nmethod on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of\nreasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic\nperspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields\nstable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models.

We propose treating verbal\nfeedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image\ngeneration, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the\nfeedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback\npairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum\nlikelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping\nstage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh\nfeedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as\nconditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more\nexpressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback.
