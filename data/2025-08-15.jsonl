A $k$th-order\napproximation of the solutions gives rise to a $k$th-order product of\nexponential (POE) spline.

We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed.

We propose\na novel element agglomeration algorithm for the virtual element method to\naddress this issue. The agglomeration algorithm renders the VEM robust over\nplanar polygonal meshes, particularly on finite element meshes cut by immersed\ngeometries. The algorithm relies on the element stability ratio, which we\ndefine using the extreme eigenvalues of the element stiffness matrix. The\nresulting element agglomeration criterion is free from nebulous polygon quality\nmetrics and is defined independently of polygon shapes. The algorithm proceeds\niteratively and element-wise to maximize the minimum element stability ratio,\neven at the expense of degrading elements with better ratios. Crucially,\nelement agglomeration alters the number of elements, not the degree of freedom\ncount. The resulting method, which we label as CutVEM, retains node locations\nof cut elements unchanged, and yields discretizations that conform to embedded\ninterfaces. This, in turn, facilitates straightforward imposition of boundary\nconditions and interfacial constraints. Through detailed numerical experiments\nthat sample varied element-interface intersections, we demonstrate that CutVEM\nenjoys dramatically improved condition numbers of global stiffness matrices\nover the VEM.

In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language.

This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based\nNormalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\\footnote{The source code of this work will be\npublicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable\nmultimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible\nCross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for\nmultimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in\nmultimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose\nthree new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention\n(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality\nCross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based\nNormalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to\nhigh-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different\nmultimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image\ntranslation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach."}

For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA\nhave identified where elephants were poached and established connections among\nshipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are\nextremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to\nobtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely\ndocumented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\"\nthat connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were\nobserved in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these\nseizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements\nother investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are\nunavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in\nwildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting\nanalysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime."}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets.

Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving\ndata in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the\nlargest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16\nmillion QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated\nannotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object\ntracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric\nreasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and\ntemporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle\nsignificantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In\ncontrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,\nachieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future\nmotion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.\nTherefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more\nreliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems."}

As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\\times$\nmemory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to\n$\\sim 7.7\\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to\nthe FP16 baseline.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used\nVSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark\nmodels, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and\nover 22.7\\% complexity reduction (in MACs).

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations.

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The\nmapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this\nprocess.

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,\nwe propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover\nchange forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem\nconditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable\nproperties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on\nimperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire\nconterminous United States.

In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI).

To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all\nnewly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure\nno identity leakage. Our method achieves \\textbf{1st place} in the competition,\nand experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance\nacross 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

Specifically, we\nintroduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,\nand a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global\nresidual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.\nTo further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first\nbenchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level\ncorrespondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsubstantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,\nsetting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity."}

Despite an extensive body of work for explaining\ntheir predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be\nattributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel\nprobabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation\nmethods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of\ngradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been\ndiscovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input\nperturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation\nhyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to\ninconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed\nformalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)\nan aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our\ntheoretical results through quantitative evaluations."}

By\ngenerating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs\npossess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing\nbidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship\nwith other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and\ncover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers\nan up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current\ntechniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.\nAnother contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference\nstrategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,\ncaching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest\napproaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications\nacross various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the\nlimitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence\nhandling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research\ndirections to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,\nwe propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover\nchange forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem\nconditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable\nproperties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on\nimperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire\nconterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for\ndecadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline\nthat assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a\nyear held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\\geq\n0.7\\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding\ncorroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns\nfrom historical data that are significant for projecting future change.\nFinally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on\nphysical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of\ndifferent scenarios by means of driver variables."}

Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,\nmotion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more\nflexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production."}

Evaluating designs in a\nholistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.\nTowards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where\nmultiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.\nA novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a\nunique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent\ndesign aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH\nbenchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines\nadapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments\nbrings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and\ngenerating actionable feedback.
