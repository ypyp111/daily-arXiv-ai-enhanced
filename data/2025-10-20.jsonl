Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by\ntask-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to\nground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance.

We provide a\nformal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that\nconstructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,\nwithout sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting\npredictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then\nalso determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be\nmodified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by\ncorrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their\ngoals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be\nlearned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior."}

Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on\npreferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning\nin RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are\ninsufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and\ninfinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses\nensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate\nheterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones.

Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set\naround the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes\nworst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian\nsearch. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution\nshift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the\ninstruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality\nrewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench\ninformative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to\napproximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.\nMoreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.\nMeanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating\nno loss on in-distribution cases.

To tackle these issues, we introduce\nthree novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \\textbf{Q-A-MLL},\n\\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \\textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets\nand annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide\na theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels\nyields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.\nIn addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.\nExtensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses\nadvanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate\nand reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content."}

Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a\ntraining strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional\naugmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling\ngeneralization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving\nrobustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and\nQwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide\nrange of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,\nachieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths."}

Our experiments on a synthetic task show that\nsequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of\npath diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world\ntasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies\nand the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts\nsuccess rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up\nto an additional $211\\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring\nits exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to\nexploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in\nRL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa."}

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training\nin shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's\ninternal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models."}

We validated our method across\nthree benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more\nthan 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient\nwith amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on\nthe three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model\nindicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of\nboth EEG and ECoG signals."}

In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,\nwe identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable\nperformance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales\nefficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of\nreinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image\ngeneration; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction\nfollowing and the consistency between generated and reference images can be\nsignificantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality\nand scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of\nmodel performance.

We also analyze the\ncomplementary roles of $T$ and $\\delta$ in balancing output diversity and\ncorrectness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level\nsampling strategies such as beam search.

We then extend this setup to latent-space\ncommunication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the\nARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation\nlimitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM\ncommunication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy\ngains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to\n14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM\nexecutor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact\non accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for\nplanning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,\ndespite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights\ninto reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid\narchitectures."}

This paper aims at striking a balance\nbetween classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable\ntrustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on\na user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid\nsolver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of\npredictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality\ncannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the\npaper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and\ndual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that\nthe hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves\nspeedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while\nguaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) act\nas a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it\naccessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a\ncross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a\ntarget language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing\nresearch has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and\ntarget languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an\nalternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target\nlanguage is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the\ncross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive\nexperimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We\nthen reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions\nthat control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a\nsimple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved\ntarget accuracy by 20-25% across different models."}

In these areas, models\nbenefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based\nobjectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in\nopen-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or\ncontext-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably\nmedical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas\nchallenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,\nan open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed\nfor high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue\ngeneration with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to\ndirect an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend\non external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided\nfeedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,\nour method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard\nbenchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving\nstate-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that\nrubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse\nconsultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These\nfindings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing\nLLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks."}

For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating\nweb pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning\noften create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to\ngeneralize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to\nlearn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by\npolymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal\n(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).\nExperiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen\nwebsites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on\nunseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration\nsettings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of\nproposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work\nacross different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own\ngoals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,\nleading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline\nmethods.
