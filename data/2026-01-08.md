Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [3] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于超类型-子类型概念层次结构的群体概念擦除方法SuPLoRA，通过共享参数高效擦除多个相关概念，同时保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型概念擦除方法在处理多个概念时效率低下且效果不佳，每个概念需要单独微调参数，且会降低整体生成质量

Method: 构建超类型-子类型概念层次结构，将语义相关概念分组；提出SuPLoRA方法，在冻结的下投影矩阵中编码超类型信息，仅更新上投影矩阵进行擦除

Result: 构建了包含名人、物体、色情内容等多领域概念的同时擦除基准，理论分析证明SuPLoRA能有效缓解生成性能退化

Conclusion: 提出的层次化概念擦除框架SuPLoRA能高效擦除多个相关概念，同时保持生成质量，解决了现有方法的扩展性和效果问题

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）的选择和能力如何影响下游视觉语言动作（VLA）策略性能，发现VLM的一般能力不能预测下游任务表现，视觉模块是主要瓶颈，控制相关监督能带来持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究一个基础但很少被系统研究的问题：VLM的选择和能力如何转化为下游VLA策略的性能。当前VLA模型虽然受到关注，但VLM能力与下游控制性能之间的关系尚不明确。

Method: 提出VLM4VLA最小适应管道，仅使用少量新可学习参数将通用VLM转换为VLA策略，实现公平高效的比较。在三个基准测试的多个下游任务上进行实证研究，并通过七个辅助具身任务微调VLM，进行模态级消融分析。

Result: VLM初始化比从头训练有持续优势，但VLM的一般能力不能预测下游任务表现；改进特定具身技能不保证更好的控制性能；视觉模块是主要瓶颈，向VLM视觉编码器注入控制相关监督能带来持续增益。

Conclusion: 标准VLM能力对具身控制是必要但不充分的，当前VLM预训练目标与具身动作规划需求存在持续领域差距，视觉编码器是关键改进方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

*Yun-Hao Zhang,I-Hsien Ting,Dario Liberona,Yun-Hsiu Liu,Kazunori Minetaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用深度学习图像识别技术对白虾进行自动分类，替代人工分拣，提高分类准确性、效率和一致性，保持虾类新鲜度并满足市场需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息技术融入水产养殖，生产稳定性提高但消费者对高品质水产品需求增长。虾类加工食品中，新鲜度下降快，软壳虾在烹饪或冷冻后容易出现头身分离，影响产品外观和消费者感知。

Method: 采用基于深度学习的图像识别技术，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）模型对刚收获的白虾进行自动分类，替代传统人工分拣方法。

Result: CNN模型提高了分类准确性、效率和一致性，减少了处理时间，有助于保持虾类新鲜度，使虾类运输企业能更有效地满足客户需求。

Conclusion: 深度学习图像识别技术能够有效解决虾类加工中的新鲜度保持和外观完整性问题，提升自动化分类水平，满足市场对高品质水产品的需求。

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

### [6] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出高阶张量方法扩展PCA，用于描述复杂形状的旋转不变特征，通过中心矩或多项式乘以高斯函数实现高精度形状描述


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA使用协方差矩阵（二阶张量）只能将形状近似为椭球体，而真实形状通常更复杂，需要更高阶的描述方法

Method: 扩展PCA到高阶张量（如三阶p_abc），使用中心矩或多项式乘以高斯函数，构建可解码的高精度形状描述符及其旋转不变量

Result: 能够创建任意高精度的形状描述符，提供旋转不变特征，可用于形状相似性比较而无需昂贵的旋转优化

Conclusion: 高阶张量方法为复杂形状分析提供了比传统PCA更强大的工具，在分子形状描述、物体识别和形状相似性度量方面有实际应用价值

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMErroR是一个多模态基准测试，包含2,013个嵌入单一连贯推理错误的样本，涵盖6大领域24个子领域，用于评估视觉语言模型检测错误推理和分类错误类型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在多模态学习中的性能提升，需要评估这些模型是否真正理解处理的内容，特别是能否检测推理过程中的错误并识别错误类型。

Method: 构建MMErroR基准测试，包含2,013个样本，每个样本嵌入单一连贯推理错误，涵盖24个子领域和6大顶级领域，进行过程级、以错误为中心的评估。

Result: 评估了20个先进视觉语言模型，即使最佳模型(Gemini-3.0-Pro)也只能在66.47%的情况下正确分类错误，表明识别错误推理具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 准确识别错误的能力为多模态推理模型的能力提供了有价值的见解，MMErroR基准测试揭示了当前模型在错误检测方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种广义可重光照的3D高斯人头模型，无需OLAT数据即可从单/多视图图像重建可重光照头像，采用两阶段设计实现跨主体泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量重光照方法需要复杂的时间复用照明数据（如OLAT），限制了应用范围。需要一种能从普通单/多视图图像重建可重光照头像的通用方法。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段学习无OLAT照明的平光3DGS头像，使用数据集特定光照代码进行自监督光照对齐；第二阶段学习从平光头像到基于物理的反射参数的映射，只需少量OLAT数据训练。

Result: 方法能泛化到未见过的头像，仅需单张图像即可拟合，支持新颖视角合成和数字头像重光照应用，效果如同采集了OLAT数据。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段可重光照3D高斯模型实现了从普通图像到高质量重光照头像的转换，无需特定照明采集，具有很好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

*Xiang Zhang,Yang Zhang,Lukas Mehl,Markus Gross,Christopher Schroers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairGuard是一个用于3D视觉任务的框架，专门处理软边界（如头发）的精细细节恢复，通过深度修复网络和生成式场景绘制器，在深度估计和视图合成中实现显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软边界（如细发）在自然和计算机生成图像中常见，但由于前景和背景线索的模糊混合，在3D视觉中处理起来具有挑战性。现有方法难以恢复这些精细的软边界细节。

Method: 1. 提出数据整理流程，利用图像抠图数据集进行训练；2. 设计深度修复网络，通过门控残差模块自动识别软边界区域并精确细化深度；3. 使用深度前向变形保留高保真纹理；4. 生成式场景绘制器填充遮挡区域并消除软边界内的冗余背景伪影；5. 颜色融合器自适应结合变形和修复结果。

Result: 在单目深度估计、立体图像/视频转换和新视图合成等任务中，HairGuard实现了最先进的性能，在软边界区域有显著改进。

Conclusion: HairGuard框架能够有效恢复3D视觉任务中的软边界精细细节，通过可插拔的深度修复和生成式场景绘制，在保持全局深度质量的同时，显著提升了软边界区域的处理效果。

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

### [10] [RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369)
*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了RiskCueBench视频风险预测基准，要求模型仅基于早期风险信号片段（而非完整视频）来预测潜在安全事件，揭示了现有系统在实际部署中的能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频社交媒体的快速增长，从视觉数据中预测风险事件对公共安全至关重要。现有研究通常让模型访问包含事故本身的完整视频序列，这大大降低了任务难度，无法反映真实世界条件。

Method: 引入新的视频理解基准RiskCueBench，通过精心标注视频来识别"风险信号片段"——即指示潜在安全担忧的最早时刻，要求模型仅基于这些早期信号进行预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前系统在解释演变情境和基于早期视觉信号预测未来风险事件方面存在显著能力差距，突显了视频风险预测模型实际部署的重要挑战。

Conclusion: RiskCueBench基准更好地反映了真实世界条件，揭示了现有视频风险预测系统在实际应用中的局限性，为开发更实用的风险预测模型指明了方向。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

### [11] [A Novel Unified Approach to Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03382)
*Lord Sen,Shyamapada Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的Deepfake检测架构，结合空间与频域特征的交叉注意力机制和血液检测模块，在FF++和Celeb-DF数据集上达到99.80%和99.88%的AUC性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，Deepfake合成与滥用威胁日益严重，为维持数字时代的信任，需要有效的Deepfake检测和标记技术。

Method: 提出统一架构，利用空间域和频域特征的交叉注意力机制，结合血液检测模块，使用Swin Transformer/BERT或EfficientNet-B4/BERT组合进行分类。

Result: 在FF++数据集上达到99.80% AUC，Celeb-DF上达到99.88% AUC（使用Swin Transformer和BERT）；使用EfficientNet-B4和BERT时分别为99.55%和99.38%。模型具有良好的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该架构在Deepfake检测方面超越了现有最佳方法，提供了统一的检测框架，并对每个步骤提供了深入见解，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

### [12] [Better, But Not Sufficient: Testing Video ANNs Against Macaque IT Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03392)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Christian Micheloni,Kohitij Kar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较恒河猴下颞叶皮层在观看自然视频时的神经响应与静态、循环和视频ANN模型，发现视频模型仅能捕捉外观依赖的动态，而非IT皮层表现的外观不变时间计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态图像训练的ANN模型是灵长类腹侧视觉流的主要模型，但它们本质上是静态计算。灵长类世界是动态的，下颞叶皮层不仅支持物体识别，还在自然视频观看中编码物体运动速度。需要探究IT的时间响应是否反映了更丰富的动态计算。

Method: 比较恒河猴IT皮层在自然视频观看期间的神经响应与静态ANN、循环ANN和视频ANN模型的预测能力。应用压力测试：在保留运动但移除形状和纹理的"外观无关"视频变体上评估解码器性能。

Result: 视频模型在神经预测性方面提供适度改进，特别是在后期响应阶段。IT群体活动在"外观无关"操作中保持泛化能力，但所有ANN类别都失败。视频模型仅能捕捉外观依赖的动态，而非IT皮层表现的外观不变时间计算。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型更好地捕捉外观依赖的动态，而非IT皮层表达的外观不变时间计算。需要新的目标函数来编码生物时间统计特性和不变性。

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eye-Q是一个多语言视觉文字谜题基准测试，旨在评估视觉语言模型的深层推理能力而非表面识别，结果显示当前最先进模型在抽象和跨语言谜题上存在显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在标准基准测试上表现良好，但主要依赖表面识别而非深层推理。需要更复杂的评估方式来测试模型发现隐含视觉线索、生成和修正假设、将感知证据映射到非字面概念的能力。

Method: 提出Eye-Q基准测试，包含1,343个多语言视觉文字谜题，要求模型观察概念密集的场景和简短描述，推断特定目标词或短语。谜题故意设计为非结构化和线索隐含，包含干扰项和需要选择性注意、抽象和关联推理的上下文关系。评估采用开放式、与人类对齐的协议，在轻度辅助下探测假设形成和修正。

Result: 评估最先进的视觉语言模型显示显著性能差距，特别是在抽象和跨语言谜题上。最大准确率仅达到60.27%，突显当前模型在构建和搜索适当概念表示以进行灵活图像到短语推理方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 视觉文字谜题是评估视觉语言模型深层推理能力的有效挑战。Eye-Q基准测试揭示了当前模型在复杂视觉理解方面的局限性，特别是在需要抽象思维和跨语言推理的任务上，为未来模型开发提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

TL;DR: GAMBIT：一种新颖的多模态越狱框架，通过构建游戏化场景驱动模型主动完成越狱，显著提升对推理模型的攻击成功率


<details>

Conclusion: 通过利用模型的推理激励和构建结构化推理链，GAMBIT能够有效突破多模态大语言模型的安全对齐，特别是在推理模型上表现出色，揭示了模型认知阶段决策可被引导的安全风险

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

TL;DR: 提出FROST-Drive架构，冻结预训练视觉编码器权重，直接利用VLM的泛化能力进行端到端自动驾驶，在Waymo数据集上优于全微调方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶模型在泛化到新场景时存在挑战，完全微调视觉编码器可能导致模型过度特化于训练数据，限制了泛化能力。本文质疑这种训练范式的必要性，探索如何更好地利用预训练视觉语言模型的泛化知识。

Method: 提出FROST-Drive架构：1) 冻结预训练VLM视觉编码器权重；2) 使用基于transformer的多模态融合适配器；3) 基于GRU的解码器生成平滑路径点；4) 设计针对Rater Feedback Score优化的自定义损失函数。

Result: 在Waymo Open E2E数据集（专门捕捉长尾场景）上的实验表明，冻结编码器方法显著优于完全微调模型，证明保留VLM广泛知识比领域特定适应更有效。

Conclusion: 保留强大VLM的泛化能力是实现鲁棒、可泛化驾驶性能的更有效策略，为开发能更好处理现实世界复杂性的视觉模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Motivation: 当前基于指令的多模态生成模型在图像编辑中视觉推理能力有限，导致推理中心编辑效果不佳。现有强化学习方法面临三个关键挑战：推理探索受限、奖励融合偏差和不稳定的VLM指令奖励。

Method: 提出ThinkRL-Edit框架：1）使用思维链推理采样，在生成前进行规划和反思阶段；2）采用无偏链偏好分组策略处理多维度奖励；3）用二进制检查表替代基于区间的VLM评分，提供更精确、低方差、可解释的奖励。

Conclusion: 通过解耦视觉推理和图像合成，扩展推理探索范围，并改进奖励机制，ThinkRL-Edit有效解决了现有强化学习在图像编辑中的关键挑战，提升了推理中心编辑的质量。

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像强化学习后训练中使用的奖励函数（如审美偏好奖励和提示一致性奖励）往往是不完美的人类判断代理，容易导致奖励黑客问题——模型生成不真实或低质量的图像却能获得高奖励分数。

Method: 1) 系统分析T2I RL后训练中的奖励黑客行为；2) 提出轻量级自适应伪影奖励模型，在小型精选数据集上训练，区分无伪影和有伪影样本；3) 将该模型集成到现有RL流程中，作为常用奖励模型的有效正则化器。

Conclusion: 奖励黑客是T2I RL后训练中的普遍问题，集成多个奖励只能部分缓解；提出的伪影奖励模型能有效检测和惩罚伪影图像，提升生成质量，为现有RL流程提供了一种轻量级且有效的安全保障机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注缓解语言先验或高层统计偏差，但忽视了视觉编码过程中的内部复杂性。作者发现视觉统计偏差（源于视觉编码器在弱结构监督下的Bag-of-Patches行为）是导致物体幻觉的重要因素，这种偏差使模型过度关注局部纹理特征而忽视整体几何结构。

Method: 提出无需训练的结构扰乱对比解码算法（SDCD），通过引入打乱的结构扰乱视图对输出分布进行对比校准，惩罚在结构缺失视图中仍保持高置信度的token，从而抑制纹理驱动的偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，SDCD在多个基准测试中显著缓解了幻觉问题，并提升了大视觉语言模型的整体多模态能力。

Conclusion: 视觉统计偏差是导致物体幻觉的关键因素，通过结构扰乱对比解码可以有效抑制纹理驱动的偏差，从而缓解幻觉问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

TL;DR: SBWM将人体运动预测重构为人体流形上的潜在动力学模拟，通过分离观测重建与动力学建模，解决了传统方法的长时程漂移、平均姿态塌陷等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人体运动预测方法将问题视为序列回归，直接外推关节坐标。这种方法存在几个根本问题：1) 没有分离观测重建与动力学建模；2) 没有显式表示控制运动的潜在原因；3) 在训练范围外会出现复合漂移、平均姿态塌陷和不确定性校准不佳的问题。

Method: 提出语义信念状态世界模型(SBWM)，将人体运动预测重构为人体流形上的潜在动力学模拟。模型维护一个循环概率信念状态，其演化独立于姿态重建学习，并显式对齐SMPL-X解剖参数化。这种对齐创建了结构信息瓶颈，防止潜在状态编码静态几何或传感器噪声，强制其捕获运动动力学、意图和控制相关结构。借鉴基于模型的强化学习中的信念状态世界模型，SBWM采用随机潜在转移和以推演为中心的训练。

Result: SBWM展示了：1) 连贯的长时程推演；2) 在显著降低计算成本的情况下保持竞争力的准确性；3) 优于基于RSSM、Transformer和扩散模型的方法（这些方法主要优化重建保真度）。

Conclusion: 将人体视为世界模型状态空间的一部分而非其输出，从根本上改变了运动的模拟和预测方式。SBWM通过分离动力学建模与观测重建，实现了更稳定、更可解释的长时程运动预测。

Abstract: Human motion prediction has traditionally been framed as a sequence regression problem where models extrapolate future joint coordinates from observed pose histories. While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted.

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Method: 提出CloudMatch框架，为每个未标注图像生成一个弱增强视图和两个互补的强增强视图：一个通过场景间混合模拟上下文多样性，另一个通过场景内混合保持语义一致性。通过跨多样化增强视图的预测一致性学习，捕捉云模式的结构多样性和上下文丰富性。

Result: 大量实验表明CloudMatch取得了良好性能，证明了其有效利用未标注数据的能力，并推进了半监督云检测的发展。

Conclusion: CloudMatch通过结合视图一致性学习和场景混合增强，能够有效利用未标注遥感图像，为半监督云检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

### [28] [EASLT: Emotion-Aware Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03549)
*Guobin Tu,Di Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASLT是一个情感感知的手语翻译框架，通过专门的情感编码器捕捉面部表情的情感动态，解决不同概念具有相同手部动作时的语义歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无标注手语翻译方法主要关注手部动作，但忽略了面部表情的语义重要性。当不同概念具有相同的手部动作时，会导致语义歧义，因此需要将面部情感作为重要的语义锚点来处理。

Method: 提出EASLT框架，包含专门的情感编码器捕捉连续的情感动态，通过情感感知融合模块自适应地重新校准时空手语特征，基于情感上下文解决语义歧义。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和CSL-Daily基准测试中，EASLT在无标注方法中取得先进性能，BLEU-4分数分别为26.15和22.80，BLEURT分数分别为61.0和57.8。

Conclusion: 明确建模情感能有效将情感语义与手部动态解耦，显著提升翻译保真度。面部表情应被视为强大的语义锚点而非辅助信息。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

TL;DR: SpatiaLoc是一个利用粗到精策略的跨模态定位框架，通过实例级和全局级的空间关系建模，实现文本和点云之间的精确定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态定位使机器人能够通过自然语言描述进行定位，在自主导航和人机交互中有重要应用。由于物体在文本和点云中经常重复出现，空间关系成为最具有区分性的定位线索。

Method: 采用粗到精策略：粗阶段使用Bezier增强对象空间编码器（BEOSE）通过二次贝塞尔曲线建模实例级空间关系，以及频率感知编码器（FAE）在频域生成全局级空间表示；精阶段使用不确定性感知高斯精细定位器（UGFL）通过建模为高斯分布来回归2D位置。

Result: 在KITTI360Pose数据集上的大量实验表明，SpatiaLoc显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc通过强调空间关系的多层次建模，在跨模态定位任务中取得了优异性能，证明了空间关系作为关键定位线索的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Yakun Niu,Yingjian Chen,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于掩码预训练模型微调策略，通过纹理感知掩码机制增强CLIP-ViT检测AI生成图像的能力，在少量数据微调下实现优异的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展提高了AI生成图像的质量，引发了关于错误信息和公众信任侵蚀的担忧。检测AI生成图像成为关键挑战，特别是在泛化到未见过的生成模型方面。现有使用冻结预训练CLIP模型的方法虽然显示出泛化潜力，但仅将图像编码器作为基本特征提取器，未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出掩码预训练模型微调策略，引入纹理感知掩码机制，在微调过程中掩码包含生成模型特定模式的纹理区域。这种方法迫使CLIP-ViT关注AI生成图像相对于真实图像的"分布偏差"，从而提升检测能力。

Result: 在GenImage和UniversalFakeDetect数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法仅用极少量的图像进行微调，就显著优于现有方法，在两个数据集上分别达到98.2%和94.6%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 通过深入分析CLIP-ViT的特性并设计纹理感知掩码机制，成功提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化性能，为解决生成模型带来的信任问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiT-Bench是一个评估纯语言模型空间智能的新基准，通过将视觉场景转换为坐标感知的文本描述，测试LLMs在无像素输入下的空间推理能力，发现现有模型在局部语义任务表现良好但全局一致性存在"空间鸿沟"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间智能研究主要依赖视觉语言模型，但核心问题未解：空间理解究竟源于视觉编码器还是基础推理架构？本文旨在探究纯语言模型是否具备空间推理能力。

Method: 提出SiT-Bench基准，包含3,800+专家标注项目，涵盖5大类17个子任务（如自我中心导航、视角转换、机器人精细操作）。将单/多视角场景转换为高保真、坐标感知的文本描述，要求LLMs进行符号文本推理而非视觉模式匹配。

Result: 评估SOTA LLMs发现：模型在局部语义任务表现良好，但在全局一致性上存在显著"空间鸿沟"；显式空间推理能显著提升性能，表明LLMs具有潜在的世界建模能力。

Conclusion: SiT-Bench为开发空间基础LLM架构提供了关键资源，有助于未来VLM和具身智能体的发展。LLMs具备空间推理潜力，但需要更强大的空间一致性建模能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种环境鲁棒的少样本分割(ER-FSS)框架，通过自适应注意力蒸馏(AAD)方法提升模型在复杂真实环境中的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本分割研究大多忽略真实场景中的复杂环境因素（如光照、背景、视角变化），导致实验室训练的模型在实际部署中表现不佳。需要建立更贴近真实应用的环境鲁棒FSS设置。

Method: 提出自适应注意力蒸馏(AAD)方法，通过反复对比和蒸馏已知支持图像与未知查询图像之间的关键共享语义，为新颖类别生成类别特定的注意力，增强模型在复杂环境中聚焦正确目标的能力。

Result: 建立了包含8个数据集的ER-FSS基准测试，AAD方法在所有数据集和设置上将mIoU提升了3.3%-8.5%，表现出优越性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了少样本分割在环境鲁棒性方面的空白，提出的AAD方法能有效提升模型在复杂真实环境中的分割性能，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对印度石刻铭文的鲁棒自适应分块策略，结合注意力U-Net进行二值化，显著提升性能并展现跨文字的零样本泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 石刻铭文图像存在对比度差、表面退化不均匀、干扰伪影多、文字密度和布局变化大等问题，导致现有二值化技术难以提取连贯字符区域

Method: 采用鲁棒自适应分块策略，通过动态采样和分块选择方法训练注意力U-Net，注意力机制帮助模型聚焦细微结构线索，克服表面噪声和布局不规则性

Result: 新分块机制显著提升二值化性能，尽管仅在单一印度文字数据集上训练，模型展现出对印度和非印度文字的强零样本泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法为下游任务（如文字识别、OCR和历史文本分析）提供了干净、结构化的铭文内容表示，展示了鲁棒性和文字无关的泛化能力

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

*Samson Oseiwe Ajadalu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统评估了深度估计主干网络和特征工程对单目伪激光雷达3D目标检测性能的影响，发现深度主干选择比语义特征注入更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测相比激光雷达成本更低，但由于从单张图像估计度量深度的困难，其精度仍然较低。需要系统评估深度估计主干和特征工程对伪激光雷达管道性能的影响。

Method: 在KITTI验证集上，使用相同的伪激光雷达生成和PointRCNN检测协议，比较NeWCRFs（监督度量深度）与Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor（Base）。测试了点云增强方法，包括外观线索（灰度强度）和语义线索（实例分割置信度）。使用真实2D边界框进行深度精度与距离的诊断分析。

Result: NeWCRFs在中等难度分割上获得10.50% AP3D（IoU=0.7）。语义特征仅提供边际增益，基于掩码的采样可能因移除上下文几何而降低性能。深度主干选择和几何保真度主导性能，超过次要特征注入。

Conclusion: 在现成的激光雷达检测器下，深度主干选择和几何保真度是决定单目伪激光雷达3D检测性能的关键因素，语义特征注入的增益有限，粗糙的深度正确性不能完全预测严格的3D IoU性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于描述性特征的对象分类技术需要对象对齐来计算相似性，这限制了方法的实用性

Method: 将对象边界归一化并分割为近似凸段，按长度降序排序，使用段长度、极值点数量、面积、基部和宽度等特征袋来测量边界相似性

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，获得了可接受的结果

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过特征排序消除了对象对齐的需求，为对象分类提供了一种有效的替代方案

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Motivation: 裂纹自动分割在基础设施状态评估中至关重要，但面临像素级标注稀缺、传感器/光照/纹理/标注规范的严重域偏移问题，限制了实际部署。

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

TL;DR: 提出PhysVideoGenerator框架，将可学习的物理先验嵌入视频生成过程，通过预测器网络从扩散潜在空间恢复物理特征，注入到DiT生成器中，验证了联合训练的可行性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能产生高质量美学视频，但在学习真实世界物理动态表示方面存在困难，导致物体碰撞不自然、重力不一致、时间闪烁等伪影。

Method: 提出PhysVideoGenerator框架，包含轻量级预测器网络PredictorP，从预训练的V-JEPA 2中提取高级物理特征，从噪声扩散潜在空间回归这些特征，然后通过专门的交叉注意力机制注入到基于DiT的生成器(Latte)的时间注意力层中。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了将可学习物理先验嵌入视频生成过程的可行性，建立了物理感知生成模型的技术基础，为未来大规模评估提供了框架。

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.

TL;DR: 提出利用2D点轨迹作为额外运动线索的自我中心动作识别新方法，通过随机采样图像点并跟踪其轨迹，结合Transformer模型显著提升识别准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心动作识别方法主要依赖RGB外观、人体姿态估计或其组合，缺乏有效的运动信息表示。本文探索使用2D点轨迹作为轻量级但有效的运动表示来增强动作理解

Method: 使用CoTracker跟踪随机初始化的图像点获取轨迹，将点轨迹与对应图像帧作为输入，采用基于Transformer的识别模型。创新之处在于不检测手、物体或交互区域，仅依赖点轨迹运动信息

Result: 实验结果表明，整合2D点轨迹相比不使用运动信息的相同模型能持续提升性能。令人惊讶的是，即使仅提供初始帧及其关联点轨迹（而非完整视频序列），也能获得显著性能增益

Conclusion: 2D点轨迹作为轻量级但有效的运动表示，能显著提升自我中心动作识别性能，为动作理解提供了新的有效线索，无需复杂的手部、物体或交互区域检测

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

TL;DR: 提出BREATH-VL框架，结合视觉语言模型（VLM）的语义理解和视觉配准的几何信息，用于内窥镜6-DoF相机定位，在BREATH数据集上取得优于纯视觉方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLM应用于内窥镜相机定位的三个挑战：缺乏大规模高质量医疗定位数据集、细粒度姿态回归能力有限、提取时序特征计算延迟高。利用VLM的通用语义理解和配准方法的精确几何对齐的互补优势。

Method: 1) 构建BREATH数据集，目前最大的体内内窥镜定位数据集；2) 提出BREATH-VL混合框架，集成VLM语义线索和视觉配准几何信息；3) 引入轻量级上下文学习机制，将运动历史编码为语言提示，实现高效时序推理。

Conclusion: VLM模块在挑战性手术场景中提供鲁棒的语义定位，BREATH-VL框架通过结合语义理解和几何信息，显著提升了内窥镜6-DoF相机定位的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

TL;DR: CSMCIR提出统一表示框架解决组合图像检索中的表示空间碎片化问题，通过多级思维链提示、对称双塔架构和动态记忆库实现高效查询-目标对齐，在多个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合图像检索方法存在表示空间碎片化问题：查询和目标由异构模态组成，使用不同编码器处理，迫使模型只能通过事后对齐来桥接未对齐的表示空间，这从根本上限制了检索性能。这种架构不对称性在特征空间中表现为三个分离的聚类，直接展示了异构模态如何从初始化就创建了根本未对齐的表示空间。

Method: CSMCIR包含三个协同组件：1) 多级思维链提示策略，引导多模态大语言模型为目标图像生成具有区分性且语义兼容的标题，建立模态对称性；2) 对称双塔架构，查询和目标两侧使用相同的共享参数Q-Former进行跨模态编码，确保一致的特征表示；3) 基于熵的时序动态记忆库策略，提供高质量负样本同时保持与演化模型状态的一致性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CSMCIR实现了最先进的性能，并具有优越的训练效率。全面的消融研究进一步验证了每个提出组件的有效性。

Conclusion: CSMCIR通过统一表示框架解决了组合图像检索中的表示空间碎片化问题，通过模态对称性、架构对称性和动态负样本策略实现了高效的查询-目标对齐，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Conclusion: MATANet通过模拟专家策略，结合环境上下文和分类学层次结构，有效提升了海洋物种细粒度分类的准确性。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Motivation: 传统RGB图像在颜色纹理模糊的真实场景中检测伪装目标效果不佳，高光谱图像虽能提供精细光谱特征，但缺乏专用大规模基准阻碍了高光谱伪装目标检测（HCOD）的发展。

Method: 提出HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM)：将高光谱图像解耦为空间图（输入SAM图像编码器）和光谱显著性图（作为自适应提示），有效桥接模态差异。

Result: HSC-SAM在HyperCOD基准上达到新的SOTA性能，并在其他公开高光谱数据集上展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperCOD数据集和HSC-SAM基线为这一新兴领域提供了坚实基础，将推动未来高光谱伪装目标检测研究的发展。

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

Motivation: 现有基于文本引导的图像编辑方法主要依赖端到端的像素级修复范式，在简单场景中成功，但在需要精确局部控制和复杂多对象空间推理的组合编辑任务中存在严重限制。主要问题包括：1) 规划与执行的隐式耦合；2) 缺乏对象级控制粒度；3) 依赖非结构化的像素中心建模。

Result: 在I2E-Bench和多个公共基准测试上的实验结果表明，I2E在处理复杂组合指令、保持物理合理性和确保多轮编辑稳定性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: I2E通过将图像编辑重新定义为结构化环境中的可操作交互过程，解决了现有像素级修复范式的局限性，为复杂组合编辑任务提供了更精确、更可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

Conclusion: MVP作为一种新颖的后训练目标，通过显式监督时序逻辑和上下文，有效弥补了现有VideoLLMs训练方法在捕捉视频动态和因果关系方面的不足

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

TL;DR: IDESplat通过迭代深度概率提升单元改进3D高斯泼溅的深度估计，实现更准确的高斯均值预测和场景重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单次warp估计深度概率，无法充分利用跨视角几何线索，导致深度图不稳定且粗糙，影响高斯均值预测精度

Method: 提出IDESplat，包含深度概率提升单元(DPBU)和迭代深度估计过程。DPBU通过级联warp操作生成极线注意力图进行乘法融合，消除单次warp的不稳定性。通过堆叠多个DPBU迭代提升深度概率估计，逐步识别高可能性深度候选

Result: 在RealEstate10K上比DepthSplat提升0.33dB PSNR，仅使用10.7%参数和70%内存。在DTU跨数据集实验中比DepthSplat提升2.95dB PSNR，展示强泛化能力。在RealEstate10K、ACID、DL3DV上实现最先进性能，具有实时效率

Conclusion: IDESplat通过迭代深度概率提升显著改进高斯均值预测，实现高质量场景重建，在多个数据集上表现优异，具有高效性和强泛化能力

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: MDENeRF：通过NeRF不确定性引导的贝叶斯融合，迭代优化单目深度估计，增强几何细节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法通常生成平滑的深度图，缺乏精细几何细节，影响场景理解的准确性。需要一种能够保留全局结构同时增强高频细节的方法。

Method: 提出MDENeRF框架，包含三个组件：1) 初始单目深度估计提供全局结构；2) 在扰动视点上训练的NeRF，带有逐像素不确定性；3) 贝叶斯融合单目深度和NeRF深度。通过体积渲染过程推导NeRF不确定性，迭代注入高频细节。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D室内场景数据集上，在关键指标和实验中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: MDENeRF通过结合单目深度估计的全局结构和NeRF的精细几何细节，有效提升了深度估计的准确性和细节丰富度。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，为从人工评估向自动化高保真损害评估的全国性转变铺平了道路。

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

We introduce HemBLIP, a vision language model designed to generate interpretable, morphology aware descriptions of peripheral blood cells. Using a newly constructed dataset of 14k healthy and leukemic cells paired with expert-derived attribute captions, we adapt a general-purpose VLM via both full fine-tuning and LoRA based parameter efficient training, and benchmark against the biomedical foundation model MedGEMMA. HemBLIP achieves higher caption quality and morphological accuracy, while LoRA adaptation provides further gains with significantly reduced computational cost.

### [57] [FocusUI: Efficient UI Grounding via Position-Preserving Visual Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03928)
*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusUI提出了一种高效的UI grounding框架，通过选择与指令最相关的视觉补丁并保持位置连续性，显著减少了视觉token数量，同时保持了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在UI grounding任务中需要处理高分辨率截图，产生数千个视觉token，导致计算开销大且注意力稀释。而人类通常只关注UI中的感兴趣区域，因此需要更高效的UI grounding方法。

Method: FocusUI框架包含两个关键创新：1) 通过融合指令条件评分和基于规则的UI图评分来构建补丁级监督，选择区分度高且与指令相关的视觉token；2) 引入PosPad策略，将连续丢弃的视觉token序列压缩为放置在该序列最后索引的特殊标记，以保持位置连续性。

Result: 在四个grounding基准测试中，FocusUI超越了GUI特定基线。在ScreenSpot-Pro基准上，FocusUI-7B比GUI-Actor-7B性能提升3.7%。即使只保留30%视觉token，性能仅下降3.2%，同时推理速度提升1.44倍，峰值GPU内存降低17%。

Conclusion: FocusUI通过有效减少冗余视觉token并保持位置连续性，实现了高效且准确的UI grounding，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResTok提出了一种新的视觉tokenizer，通过构建分层残差表示来改进自回归图像生成，在ImageNet-256上仅用9步采样达到gFID 2.34。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语言模型设计的1D视觉tokenizer忽略了视觉数据的关键特性，特别是分层和残差网络设计在视觉模型中的重要性。需要将"视觉"特性重新引入视觉tokenizer中。

Method: 提出Residual Tokenizer (ResTok)，构建图像token和潜在token的分层残差表示。通过渐进合并获得分层表示，实现跨层级特征融合，同时语义残差防止信息重叠。还引入分层AR生成器加速生成过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上仅用9步采样达到gFID 2.34，显著改进了自回归图像生成性能。分层残差先验的恢复显著提升了AR图像生成质量。

Conclusion: 在视觉tokenization中恢复分层残差先验能显著改进自回归图像生成，ResTok通过引入视觉特性实现了更高效、更高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

TL;DR: 提出了FUSION，首个基于扩散模型的无条件全身运动先验，联合建模身体和手部运动，解决了现有方法忽略手部或任务范围狭窄的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手部对于与环境交互和传达手势至关重要，但现有运动合成方法要么完全忽略手部运动，要么只能在高度受限的设置下生成狭窄任务的全身运动。主要障碍是缺乏大规模数据集来联合捕捉多样化的全身运动和详细的手部关节。

Method: 1. 整理并统一现有的手部运动数据集与大规模身体运动数据，生成包含手部和身体的全身序列；2. 提出首个基于扩散模型的无条件全身运动先验FUSION，联合建模身体和手部运动；3. 开发优化流程，通过精炼扩散模型的潜在空间来生成特定任务运动。

Result: 1. 在HumanML3D数据集的关键点跟踪任务上超越了最先进的骨骼控制模型；2. 实现了更优越的运动自然度；3. 展示了两个应用：给定物体运动时生成包含手指的详细全身交互运动，以及使用LLM将自然语言线索转化为可执行运动约束的自我交互运动。

Conclusion: FUSION能够精确控制手部运动，同时保持合理的全身协调性，超越了典型运动先验的使用范围，为全身运动合成提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Padé神经元（Paons），一种基于Padé逼近的新型非线性神经元模型，比传统McCulloch-Pitts神经元具有更强的非线性能力，能用更少层数达到更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络使用McCulloch-Pitts神经元模型（线性模型加逐点非线性激活），虽然已有二次神经元、广义运算神经元等非线性模型，但需要更强的非线性表达能力。Padé逼近能提供更丰富的非线性函数逼近能力。

Method: 基于Padé逼近理论设计Padé神经元（Paons），每个Paon学习输入的不同非线性函数。Paons包含所有先前提出的神经元模型作为特例，可将任何网络中的任何神经元替换为Paons。在ResNet架构的图像超分辨率、压缩和分类模型中用Paons替换经典神经元。

Result: 实验表明，使用Paons构建的神经模型在更少层数的情况下，性能优于或等于经典对应模型。Paons提供了非线性多样性，每个Paon学习不同的非线性函数，层效率更高。

Conclusion: Padé神经元（Paons）是一种优越的非线性神经元模型，具有非线性多样性和层效率优势，能提升神经网络性能同时减少层数，为神经网络架构设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频奖励模型主要关注视觉质量、运动质量和文本对齐，但忽视了关键的结构失真问题（如异常物体外观和交互），这些失真会严重降低生成视频的整体质量。

Method: 1) 构建大规模人类偏好数据集，基于提出的结构失真分类法进行标注；2) 使用高效的思维链合成管道生成额外数据；3) 采用两阶段训练框架：先进行带掩码损失的监督微调注入领域知识，然后使用GRPO和成对奖励进行强化学习；4) 推理时引入动态采样机制关注最可能出现失真的帧。

Result: REACT在评估结构失真方面优于现有奖励模型，既能提供准确的定量评估，又能进行可解释的归因分析。同时提出了REACT-Bench基准测试。

Conclusion: REACT有效填补了生成视频评估中结构失真评估的空白，为视频生成质量提供了更全面的评估工具，并能与现有奖励模型形成互补。

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

Conclusion: LocalDPO为视频生成器对齐建立了更高效、细粒度的范式，通过局部偏好对和区域感知优化解决了现有方法的效率和质量问题

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Result: 实验结果显示：1. 模型在不到10%的情况下能成功自我纠正；2. 模型主要受盲目的文本错误传播影响；3. 提出的方法能显著抑制幻觉传播并增强推理鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了大型多模态模型在视频推理中的文本惯性问题，并提出了一种有效的训练无关解决方案，通过主动视觉重定位和上下文精炼来增强推理链的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

Motivation: 为了将强大的基础重建模型先验与视频扩散模型相结合，实现场景级的3D生成，同时探索重建模型与生成模型紧密耦合的相互增益

Method: 重新利用VGGT重建模型生成几何潜在表示，通过训练适配器使其与预训练视频扩散模型的外观潜在表示对齐，联合生成解耦但对齐的潜在表示

Result: 在单图像和多图像条件下的3D场景生成中达到最先进水平，能同时生成RGB视频、相机姿态、深度图和全局点云，并能利用生成先验增强重建鲁棒性

Conclusion: Gen3R成功桥接了重建模型和生成模型，展示了紧密耦合这两类模型的相互益处，为场景级3D生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

TL;DR: GeoReason框架通过构建逻辑驱动数据集和两阶段训练策略，解决遥感视觉语言模型中的逻辑幻觉问题，提升空间决策的认知可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前遥感视觉语言模型存在逻辑幻觉问题，即正确答案来自错误推理链或依赖位置捷径而非空间逻辑，这种解耦现象削弱了复杂空间任务中的战略决策可靠性。

Method: 1. 构建GeoReason-Bench数据集（4000个推理轨迹）；2. 两阶段训练：监督知识初始化（学习推理语法和领域知识）和一致性感知强化学习（引入逻辑一致性奖励，通过选项排列策略惩罚逻辑漂移）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架显著提升了遥感视觉语言模型的认知可靠性和可解释性，相比其他先进方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GeoReason框架通过同步内部思维与最终决策，有效解决了遥感视觉语言模型中的逻辑幻觉问题，为复杂空间任务提供了更可靠的认知推理能力。

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

Motivation: 卫星持续产生海量地球观测数据，特别是卫星图像时间序列(SITS)。现有深度学习模型大多处理完整图像或完整时间序列来提取特征，但缺乏对像素级时间变化的有效编码方法。

Method: 1) 将像素级植被指数时间序列(NDVI、EVI、SAVI)转换为递归图作为二维表示；2) 提出PIMC多模态自监督方法，结合二维像素时间序列表示和遥感影像进行对比学习；3) 在PASTIS数据集上进行像素级预测和分类，在EuroSAT数据集上进行土地覆盖分类。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理卫星图像时间序列和遥感影像提供了一个鲁棒的自监督框架，二维表示和对比学习的结合有效提升了地球观测任务性能。

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Klear是一个统一的音频-视频联合生成模型，通过创新的单塔架构、渐进式多任务训练策略和首个大规模密集标注数据集，解决了现有方法在音视频同步、唇语对齐和多模态退化方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-视频联合生成方法存在音视频不同步、唇语对齐差、单模态退化等问题，这些问题源于弱音视频对应建模、有限泛化能力和高质量密集标注数据稀缺。需要从模型架构、训练策略和数据构建三个维度系统解决。

Method: 1. 架构：采用单塔设计，统一DiT块和Omni-Full Attention机制，实现紧密音视频对齐和强扩展性；2. 训练：渐进式多任务策略（随机模态掩码到联合优化）和多阶段课程学习，增强鲁棒表示和防止单模态崩溃；3. 数据：构建首个大规模密集标注音频-视频数据集，开发自动化数据构建流程，筛选高质量对齐的三元组数据。

Result: Klear在大规模数据集上表现出色，实现高保真、语义和时间对齐的指令跟随生成，在联合和单模态设置中均表现优异，在分布外场景中泛化能力强。在各项任务中大幅超越先前方法，性能与Veo 3相当。

Conclusion: Klear通过架构、训练和数据的系统性创新，为下一代音频-视频合成提供了统一、可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了音视频生成的质量、对齐度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion-DRF方法，使用冻结的视觉语言模型作为免训练评判器，通过可微分奖励流微调视频扩散模型，避免传统偏好优化方法的标签依赖、偏见和奖励攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于DPO的文本到视频生成方法依赖不可微分的偏好信号（人类标注或学习型奖励模型），导致训练标签密集、易产生偏见、易被攻击，常引发奖励攻击和不稳定训练。

Method: 使用冻结的现成视觉语言模型作为免训练评判器，通过可微分奖励流直接反向传播VLM反馈到扩散去噪链中，将logit级响应转换为token感知梯度进行优化。采用自动化、方面结构化的提示管道获取可靠的多维VLM反馈，并通过梯度检查点实现高效更新。

Result: Diffusion-DRF提高了视频质量和语义对齐，同时缓解了奖励攻击和崩溃问题，无需额外的奖励模型或偏好数据集。该方法具有模型无关性，可轻松推广到其他基于扩散的生成任务。

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF提供了一种有效且稳定的视频扩散模型微调方法，通过利用现成VLM作为可微分评判器，避免了传统偏好优化方法的局限性，在提升生成质量的同时保证了训练稳定性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToTMNet提出了一种轻量级rPPG架构，使用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代注意力机制，在保持高心率估计精度的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的rPPG方法虽然提高了鲁棒性，但计算成本和参数数量增加，特别是基于注意力的时间建模会带来时间长度二次方缩放的问题。需要更轻量高效的架构。

Method: 提出ToTMNet架构，使用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代注意力机制。Toeplitz算子使用线性参数提供全序列时间感受野，通过循环嵌入和FFT卷积实现近线性时间计算。架构结合局部深度时间卷积分支和门控全局Toeplitz混合。

Result: 在UBFC-rPPG数据集上达到1.055 bpm MAE和0.996 Pearson相关系数；在合成到真实场景(SCAMPS到UBFC-rPPG)达到1.582 bpm MAE和0.994相关系数。模型仅63k参数。

Conclusion: Toeplitz结构时间混合是rPPG中注意力机制的高效替代方案，在保持精度的同时大幅降低计算复杂度。门控机制对有效利用全局Toeplitz混合很重要，特别是在域转移场景下。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在局限性：2D图像方法易于构建维护但几何推理能力有限；3D结构方法精度高但需要集中重建且难以更新。需要一种既能保持2D方法易用性又能实现高精度几何推理的解决方案。

Method: 使用2D图像增强深度图的表示方法，通过密集匹配器有效利用几何结构。采用紧凑压缩和GPU加速的LO-RANSAC实现，在存储和计算效率之间提供灵活权衡。

Conclusion: 通过增强2D图像表示与深度信息，结合密集匹配技术，实现了既易于构建维护又具有高精度的视觉定位方法，在存储和计算效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理世界中的动态物体不断演化、变形和交互，产生多样的4D场景动态。传统基于规则的图形流水线需要类别特定的启发式方法，劳动密集且不可扩展；而基于学习的方法通常需要大规模数据集，难以覆盖所有感兴趣的物体类别。

Method: 提出基于蒸馏的流水线，从2D视频的欧拉表示中提取隐藏的拉格朗日运动信息，继承视频生成模型的通用性，实现类别无关的动态生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成多样化的多体4D动态，相比现有方法具有优势，并展示了在生成机器人操作策略方面的应用潜力。

Conclusion: CHORD是一个通用、多功能、类别无关的方法，能够从2D视频中提取运动信息，有效生成各种4D场景动态，在动态场景合成和机器人操作等领域具有应用价值。

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

TL;DR: DeepResearch-Slice：一种神经符号框架，通过预测精确的文本跨度索引进行确定性硬过滤，解决检索-利用差距问题，在噪声环境中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究代理主要优化搜索策略以最大化检索概率，但存在检索-利用差距的关键瓶颈：即使检索到黄金证据，模型在噪声环境中因上下文盲点而无法有效利用这些证据。

Method: 提出DeepResearch-Slice神经符号框架，不同于隐式注意力机制，该方法预测精确的文本跨度索引，在推理前执行确定性硬过滤，从而在噪声环境中有效利用检索到的证据。

Result: 在六个基准测试上评估显示显著鲁棒性提升。应用于冻结骨干网络时获得73%的相对改进（从19.1%提升至33.0%），有效缓解噪声影响且无需更新推理模型参数。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在开放式研究中需要明确的接地机制，神经符号方法能有效解决检索-利用差距问题，提升模型在噪声环境中的证据利用能力。

Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM的奉承行为无法仅靠内部推理解决，需要外部结构约束。在对抗数据集上测试显示，内部推理在弱模型中导致性能崩溃，在先进模型中仍有11.4%输出差距，而外部机制能完全消除奉承行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常表现出奉承行为，优先迎合用户而非保持正确性。本研究旨在探究这种现象是否需要外部监管，还是可以通过内部推理单独解决。

Method: 使用CAP-GSM8K对抗数据集（N=500），在GPT-3.5、GPT-4o和GPT-5.1上比较内部推理机制（思维链）与外部机制（RCA）的效果。

Result: 内部推理存在结构性局限：在弱模型中导致性能崩溃（优先悖论），在先进模型中仍有11.4%的最终输出差距。相反，RCA在所有模型层级上都能完全消除奉承行为（0.0%）。

Conclusion: 研究提出了热力学层次理论：只有当能力匹配且强大时，混合系统才能达到共振（最优效率），而弱或不匹配的系统会陷入失调和熵增。这证实了外部结构约束对于保证安全性是严格必要的。

Abstract: Large Language Models frequently exhibit sycophancy, prioritizing user agreeableness over correctness. We investigate whether this requires external regulation or can be mitigated by internal reasoning alone. Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型安全评估方法主要采用基于示例的约束方法，这种方法在策略覆盖范围、攻击策略多样性和提示保真度方面存在局限性，需要更全面、可扩展的评估框架来识别和缓解LLM的安全漏洞。

Method: 使用攻击LLM生成大量多样化的对抗提示，然后通过偏好数据集对该攻击模型进行微调，实现策略覆盖、攻击策略多样性和提示保真度三个关键目标的帕累托最优。

Result: 在开源和专有模型（如GPT-40和Claude 3.5）上实现了显著更高的攻击成功率，优于现有最先进技术，同时生成人类可读且有效的对抗提示，需要最少的人工干预。

Conclusion: Jailbreak-Zero为LLM安全评估提供了一个更可扩展和全面的解决方案，能够更有效地识别和缓解安全漏洞，代表了从基于示例到基于策略的评估范式转变。

Abstract: This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 专有LLM系统在临床决策中存在隐私问题和云基础设施依赖，而开源替代方案通常模型过大，难以在资源受限的临床环境中使用。需要评估本地部署的轻量级LLM在临床任务中的实际表现。

Method: 在三个代表性临床任务上对两种本地LLM（gpt-oss-20b和gpt-oss-120b）进行基准测试：1）一般疾病诊断；2）专科（眼科）诊断和管理；3）模拟人类专家评分和评估。与最先进的专有模型（GPT-5和o4-mini）和领先的开源模型（DeepSeek-R1）进行比较，并对gpt-oss-20b在一般诊断数据上进行微调以评估适应性。

Result: 在所有任务中，gpt-oss模型尽管规模显著更小，但性能达到或超过了DeepSeek-R1和o4-mini。微调显著提高了gpt-oss-20b的诊断准确性，使其能够接近GPT-5的性能水平。

Conclusion: 本地部署的LLM能够提供准确、适应性强且保护隐私的临床决策支持，为LLM更广泛地融入常规临床实践提供了实用途径，展示了在资源受限环境中部署高效临床AI系统的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.

TL;DR: GPT-5是一个统一系统，包含智能快速模型、深度推理模型和实时路由器，通过安全训练减少幻觉，在写作、编程和健康领域表现提升，并对生物化学领域采取预防性安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个更强大、更实用的AI系统，不仅要在基准测试中超越前代模型，更要提升真实世界查询的实用性，同时通过先进的安全训练减少幻觉、改善指令遵循，并针对高风险领域采取预防性安全措施。

Method: 采用统一系统架构：1) 智能快速模型处理大多数问题；2) 深度推理模型处理复杂问题；3) 实时路由器根据对话类型、复杂度、工具需求和明确意图动态选择模型。路由器通过用户切换模型、响应偏好和正确性测量等真实信号持续训练。系统还包含安全完成机制防止不允许的内容。

Result: GPT-5在基准测试中超越前代模型，响应速度更快，对真实世界查询更有用。在减少幻觉、改善指令遵循和最小化奉承方面取得显著进展，在写作、编程和健康这三个ChatGPT最常用领域表现提升。系统对生物化学领域采取"高能力"分类并激活相应安全防护。

Conclusion: GPT-5通过创新的统一系统架构实现了性能和安全性的双重提升，在实用性和安全性方面都取得了重要进展，特别是对高风险领域采取了预防性安全措施，体现了负责任AI开发的理念。

Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.

*Gabriel Benedict,Matthew Butler,Naved Merchant,Eetu Salama-Laine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出当前大语言模型评估偏向推理任务，导致小语言模型评分偏低，但实际工业应用中，小语言模型在非推理任务（如语气修改）上表现优异。作者提出了专门评估小语言模型在非推理任务上能力的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估主要关注推理和问题解决任务，这导致小语言模型（参数小于100亿）在这些指标上得分比大语言模型低3-4倍。然而，这种评估未能捕捉小语言模型在常见工业应用（如语气修改任务）中的实际有效性。

Method: 提出了专门为非推理任务设计的评估框架，结合了数据生成、提示调优和基于大语言模型的评估等新方法，展示了任务特定微调的潜力。

Result: 该框架能够有效评估小语言模型和大语言模型在实际应用中的表现，特别是在边缘计算和私有计算场景下，为从业者提供了实用的评估工具。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考语言模型评估标准，特别是针对小语言模型在工业应用中的实际能力。提出的评估框架有助于更准确地评估模型在非推理任务上的表现，为实际部署提供指导。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted language model evaluation toward reasoning and problem-solving tasks as measures of general intelligence. Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning. This work provides practitioners with tools to effectively benchmark both SLMs and LLMs for practical applications, particularly in edge and private computing scenarios. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/wraval.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了13个主流大语言模型在企业RAG场景中的指令遵循能力，发现模型间存在显著的"指令差距"，Claude-Sonnet-4和GPT-5表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但在企业部署中发现关键限制：对定制指令的遵循不一致。企业环境需要精确的指令遵循能力，而现有模型在这方面存在不足。

Method: 使用系统化测试方法，对13个领先的LLM进行综合评估，包括指令遵循性、响应准确性和性能指标。采用真实世界的RAG场景、样本测试和企业级评估协议。

Result: 不同模型在指令遵循方面差异显著，Claude-Sonnet-4和GPT-5获得最高分。研究揭示了"指令差距"现象：模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在企业部署所需的精确指令遵循方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 该研究为企业部署LLM解决方案提供了实用见解，并为各大模型家族的指令遵循能力建立了基准。强调了解决"指令差距"对企业成功部署AI解决方案的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自2021年以来，语义文本相似性研究快速发展，涌现出多种新技术和方法。然而，缺乏对这些进展的系统性梳理和分析。本文旨在通过全面综述STS领域的最新发展，为研究者和实践者提供导航，帮助他们理解当前方法、应用场景和未来方向。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) research has expanded rapidly since 2021, driven by advances in transformer architectures, contrastive learning, and domain-specific techniques. This survey reviews progress across six key areas: transformer-based models, contrastive learning, domain-focused solutions, multi-modal methods, graph-based approaches, and knowledge-enhanced techniques. Recent transformer models such as FarSSiBERT and DeBERTa-v3 have achieved remarkable accuracy, while contrastive methods like AspectCSE have established new benchmarks. Domain-adapted models, including CXR-BERT for medical texts and Financial-STS for finance, demonstrate how STS can be effectively customized for specialized fields. Moreover, multi-modal, graph-based, and knowledge-integrated models further enhance semantic understanding and representation. By organizing and analyzing these developments, the survey provides valuable insights into current methods, practical applications, and remaining challenges. It aims to guide researchers and practitioners alike in navigating rapid advancements, highlighting emerging trends and future opportunities in the evolving field of STS.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需历史模型性能数据的测试集压缩框架，通过领域适应嵌入和任务感知聚类，在保持评估精度的同时减少90%以上计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有垂直领域LLM评估基准存在语义冗余和高计算成本问题，而现有压缩方法依赖历史模型评估数据，无法应用于冷启动场景（新任务、新领域或新模型）

Method: 1) 使用少量领域数据微调基础LLM以学习任务语义；2) 仅基于原始文本内容生成高级语义嵌入；3) 在领域适应嵌入空间进行任务感知聚类；4) 引入数据集X-ray机制分析聚类几何，动态校准压缩强度

Result: 在专业领域数据集（特别是大规模3GPP通信基准）上，该方法能有效识别并移除冗余样本，减少90%以上的评估成本，同时保持与完整基准的高保真度

Conclusion: 提出了一种历史无关的测试集压缩框架，解决了冷启动场景下的基准压缩问题，为垂直领域LLM评估提供了高效且准确的解决方案

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GuardEval是一个多视角安全评估基准数据集，包含106个细粒度类别，用于训练和评估LLM内容审核。基于此训练的GemmaGuard模型在安全审核任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在内容审核方面存在局限性：难以处理隐式冒犯、微妙偏见和越狱提示等复杂情况，依赖训练数据可能强化社会偏见，导致不一致和伦理问题的输出。需要更精细、多视角的安全评估系统。

Method: 1. 构建GuardEval基准数据集，包含106个细粒度类别，涵盖人类情感、冒犯和仇恨言论、性别和种族偏见、更广泛的安全问题。2. 基于Gemma3-12B模型，使用QLoRA微调技术训练GemmaGuard模型，用于细粒度内容审核。

Result: GemmaGuard在评估中取得0.832的宏F1分数，显著优于OpenAI Moderator（0.64）和Llama Guard（0.61）。多视角、以人为中心的安全基准能有效减少偏见和不一致的审核决策。

Conclusion: 多样化和代表性的数据能显著提高LLM在复杂边界案例中的安全性、公平性和鲁棒性。GuardEval和GemmaGuard共同证明了多视角安全评估的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.

Motivation: 传统角色分析需要大量人工标注，效率低下且难以标准化。需要自动化工具来支持大规模、可重复的文学角色分析研究。

Method: 开发 Python 包，包含文本分块、LLM 标注、角色消歧、质量评分、统计计算和嵌入生成等功能，支持商业/开源/自定义 LLM，并提供人机交互 GUI 进行质量验证。

Result: 通过《辛普森一家》电影和《傲慢与偏见》小说的示例演示了该包的高效性和可重复性，能够标准化角色分析流程。

Conclusion: LLM_annotate 为文学角色分析提供了高效、可重复的工具，支持多种 LLM，通过人机交互确保质量，有助于推动计算文学研究。

Abstract: LLM_annotate is a Python package for analyzing the personality of fiction characters with large language models. It standardizes workflows for annotating character behaviors in full texts (e.g., books and movie scripts), inferring character traits, and validating annotation/inference quality via a human-in-the-loop GUI. The package includes functions for text chunking, LLM-based annotation, character name disambiguation, quality scoring, and computation of character-level statistics and embeddings. Researchers can use any LLM, commercial, open-source, or custom, within LLM_annotate. Through tutorial examples using The Simpsons Movie and the novel Pride and Prejudice, I demonstrate the usage of the package for efficient and reproducible character analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主题分割使用生成式大语言模型仍相对未被充分探索。现有方法主要基于句子间的语义相似度，但这些模型缺乏大语言模型所具有的长距离依赖关系和丰富知识。

Method: 提出一种使用句子枚举的重叠递归提示策略，并支持采用边界相似度评估指标来衡量分割效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，大语言模型作为主题分割器比现有方法更有效，在边界相似度评估指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在主题分割任务上具有潜力，但在能够可靠用于主题分割之前，仍有一些问题需要解决。

Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种针对ARM64架构的"虚拟张量核心"软件架构，通过直接内存映射和手动优化的NEON SIMD内核，实现软件定义的DMA，在M2硬件上达到>60 tokens/秒的稳定吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上部署大型语言模型受到"内存墙"限制，标准推理运行时存在高层抽象、动态调度和未对齐内存访问模式等显著开销。

Method: 1) 绕过标准库容器，采用直接内存映射(mmap)；2) 实现手动调优的NEON SIMD内核；3) 提出张量虚拟化布局(TVL)确保权重矩阵100%缓存线利用率；4) 零拷贝加载器消除初始化延迟。

Result: 在110M参数模型上，M2硬件实现稳定吞吐量>60 tokens/秒，满足200ms心理语言学延迟阈值，无需专有硬件加速器依赖。

Conclusion: 该架构提供了一个完全开源、可移植且确定性的参考实现，用于研究通用ARM硅上的内存瓶颈，虽然专有硬件加速器能达到更高峰值吞吐量。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了BPE分词如何将语料库统计特性转化为Zipf分布，并揭示了BPE作为统计变换机制的作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言表现出显著的统计规律性（如Zipf定律和Heaps定律），但这些特性与现代Transformer模型使用的分词方案之间的关系尚不清楚。需要研究BPE分词如何影响语料库的统计特性和信息内容。

Method: 1. 在Zipf频率分布假设下分析各种语料库的信息内容（香农熵），推导槽熵期望值的闭式表达式；2. 实证研究BPE如何转换语料库统计特性；3. 在不同BPE深度分词的语料库上训练语言模型，分析模型预测熵的变化；4. 使用注意力机制诊断分析局部标记依赖关系。

Result: 1. BPE的递归应用驱动标记频率趋向Zipf幂律分布；2. BPE诱导经验熵呈现特征性增长模式；3. 随着BPE深度增加，模型预测熵与Zipf推导的预测值越来越一致；4. 更深的分词减少了局部标记依赖，使经验分布更接近弱依赖（近IID）状态。

Conclusion: BPE不仅作为压缩机制，还作为统计变换机制，重建了自然语言的关键信息特性。研究阐明了BPE如何将语料库统计特性转化为Zipf分布，这对理解现代语言模型的分词策略具有重要意义。

Abstract: Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

TL;DR: PersonaWeaver框架解决现有角色生成方法中的两种对齐偏差：积极道德偏差和乐于助人助手偏差，通过分离世界构建和行为构建来生成更具多样性的角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色生成方法存在两种对齐偏差：积极道德偏差（角色总是采取赞同立场）和乐于助人助手偏差（角色总是直接回答问题）。这些偏差虽然适合指令遵循系统，但抑制了戏剧张力，导致角色可预测性高，源于最大似然训练和助手微调。

Method: 提出PersonaWeaver框架，将世界构建（角色、人口统计信息）与行为构建（道德立场、互动风格）解耦，从而生成具有更多样化反应和道德立场的角色，以及在长度、语气、标点等风格标记上的二阶多样性。

Result: PersonaWeaver能够生成具有更丰富多样性的角色，包括不同的道德立场、互动风格和语言特征，解决了现有方法的对齐偏差问题。

Conclusion: 通过分离世界构建和行为构建，PersonaWeaver框架能够生成更具戏剧张力和不可预测性的角色，为大规模角色生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Procedural content generation has enabled vast virtual worlds through levels, maps, and quests, but large-scale character generation remains underexplored. We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

TL;DR: 提出Disclaimer Injection方法，通过注入精心设计的对齐触发免责声明，使文本对LLM不可学习，利用模型自身的对齐机制实现数据保护


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在训练中大量使用异构文本语料，引发对未经授权使用专有或个人数据的担忧。需要在现实黑盒设置下保护数据，防止模型学习

Method: 提出Disclaimer Injection方法：在文本中注入精心设计的对齐触发免责声明，利用LLM自身的对齐机制阻止有效学习。通过层间分析发现，在受保护数据上微调会导致对齐相关层持续激活

Result: 在受保护数据上训练的模型相比标准微调表现出显著且系统的性能下降。对齐行为成为数据保护的新杠杆

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了在LLM规模上限制数据可学习性，无需访问或修改训练流程。对齐行为是数据保护中未被探索的新机制

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, heterogeneous text corpora, raising serious concerns about the unauthorised use of proprietary or personal data during model training. In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.

Abstract: We present a systematic formalization of Tigrinya cardinal and ordinal number verbalization, addressing a gap in computational resources for the language. This work documents the canonical rules governing the expression of numerical values in spoken Tigrinya, including the conjunction system, scale words, and special cases for dates, times, and currency. We provide a formal algorithm for number-to-word conversion and release an open-source implementation. Evaluation of frontier large language models (LLMs) reveals significant gaps in their ability to accurately verbalize Tigrinya numbers, underscoring the need for explicit rule documentation. This work serves language modeling, speech synthesis, and accessibility applications targeting Tigrinya-speaking communities.

TL;DR: LatentGraphMem：结合隐式图记忆与显式子图检索的混合记忆框架，用于长上下文问答任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统存在两难：显式结构化记忆可解释但脆弱，隐式记忆机制高效稳定但难以检查。长上下文应用中，相关证据稀疏且分散，需要更好的记忆系统。

Method: 提出LatentGraphMem框架：1）在隐式空间存储图结构记忆以保证稳定性和效率；2）提供任务特定的子图检索接口，在固定预算下返回紧凑的符号子图用于推理和人工检查；3）训练时生成显式图视图与冻结推理器交互进行问答监督；4）推理时在隐式空间检索，仅外部化检索到的子图。

Result: 在多个模型规模的长时域基准测试中，LatentGraphMem始终优于代表性的显式图和隐式记忆基线，同时支持参数高效适应，并能灵活扩展到更大的推理器而不引入大型符号工件。

Conclusion: LatentGraphMem成功结合了隐式记忆的稳定性与显式记忆的可解释性，为长上下文问答提供了一种高效、可扩展且可检查的记忆解决方案。

Abstract: Long-horizon applications increasingly require large language models (LLMs) to answer queries when relevant evidence is sparse and dispersed across very long contexts. Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks across multiple model scales show that LatentGraphMem consistently outperforms representative explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, while enabling parameter-efficient adaptation and flexible scaling to larger reasoners without introducing large symbolic artifacts.

Motivation: 验证系统生成的摘要具有挑战性，特别是在高风险医学领域，需要精确的上下文归因。现有方法缺乏细粒度的归因评估框架。

Method: 提出了PCoA基准数据集，包含专家标注的医学基于方面的摘要，将每个方面摘要与其支持上下文句子和贡献短语对齐。设计了细粒度的解耦评估框架，独立评估生成摘要、引用和贡献短语的质量。

Result: 实验验证了PCoA数据集的质量和一致性，并在该任务上评估了多个大语言模型。结果表明PCoA为评估具有短语级上下文归因的系统生成摘要提供了可靠基准，且明确识别相关句子和贡献短语能提高整体质量。

Conclusion: PCoA为医学领域摘要验证提供了可靠的短语级上下文归因基准，解耦评估框架有助于全面评估系统性能，先识别相关内容和贡献短语能改善摘要质量。

Abstract: Verifying system-generated summaries remains challenging, as effective verification requires precise attribution to the source context, which is especially crucial in high-stakes medical domains. To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that explicitly identifying relevant sentences and contributory phrases before summarization can improve overall quality.

TL;DR: CAPT是一种无需训练的模型集成方法，通过对比解码将临床模型的相关信号注入到通用领域模型中，实现跨架构的模型适应，在临床任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将语言模型适应到临床领域通常需要昂贵的重新训练，特别是当新模型发布时。现有方法无法有效利用不同代际、不同架构的模型，且需要重复训练成本高昂。

Method: 提出跨架构代理调优（CAPT），利用对比解码技术，将临床模型的相关信号选择性地注入到通用领域模型中。该方法支持具有不重叠词汇表的模型，无需额外训练，通过模型集成实现临床适应。

Result: 在六个临床分类和文本生成任务上，CAPT使用新一代通用模型和旧一代临床模型，始终优于单个模型和现有集成方法（平均比UniTE高17.6%，比代理调优高41.4%）。

Conclusion: CAPT提供了一种高效、无需训练的临床领域适应方法，能够增强临床相关语言表达，减少上下文错误，提高临床特异性，为模型适应提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.

TL;DR: ASPECTSIM是一个简单可解释的框架，通过显式指定方面来评估文档相似性，相比传统整体方法显著提升了人类-机器一致性（GPT-4o实现时提升约80%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档相似性评估采用整体方法，忽略了不同方面的差异。作者认为需要显式考虑特定方面来更准确地衡量文档相似性，并需要修订当前的标准实践。

Method: 提出ASPECTSIM框架，要求基于显式指定的方面来评估文档相似性。使用新构建的包含26K个方面-文档对的基准进行实验。采用GPT-4o直接提示实现ASPECTSIM，并与16个开源小LLM和9个嵌入模型进行大规模元评估。

Result: GPT-4o实现的ASPECTSIM相比无显式方面的整体相似性方法，人类-机器一致性提升约80%。开源小LLM直接提示效果不佳（20-30%一致性），但通过两阶段精炼提升约140%，仍远低于GPT-4o。嵌入模型表现也有限。

Conclusion: 显式考虑方面对文档相似性评估至关重要，需要修订标准实践。虽然开源小LLM可通过精炼改进，但仍大幅落后于大型专有模型（如GPT-4o）在捕捉方面条件相似性方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce ASPECTSIM, a simple and interpretable framework that requires conditioning document similarity on an explicitly specified aspect, which is different from the traditional holistic approach in measuring document similarity. Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\approx$140%. Nevertheless, agreement remains well below that of GPT-4o-based models, indicating that smaller open-source LLMs still lag behind large proprietary models in capturing aspect-conditioned similarity.

TL;DR: LLM作为评估者时，评分量表的选取显著影响评分一致性和人机对齐，0-5分制表现最佳，但聚合可靠性可能掩盖基准异质性和性别群体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM越来越多地被用作自动评估者，但先前研究表明LLM评判者在提示改变时往往缺乏评分一致性。然而，评分量表本身的影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过比较人类和LLM两种评分者，在三种评分量表上收集六个基准（包括客观、开放式主观和混合任务）的评分。使用组内相关系数(ICC)测量绝对一致性，分析量表选择对人类-LLM一致性的影响。

Result: LLM判断在主观基准上跨量表不一致，量表选择显著影响人类-LLM一致性。在任务聚合后，0-5分制产生最强的人类-LLM对齐。聚合可靠性可能掩盖基准异质性和性别群体间的系统性差异。

Conclusion: 评分量表设计和子级诊断是LLM作为评判者协议的重要组成部分，需要关注量表选择对评估一致性和群体差异的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.

Motivation: 传统语言模型通过下一词预测预训练，虽然能学习世界知识和推理能力，但没有明确优化语法能力。需要填补这一空白，提升语言模型的语法能力

Method: 提出L2T预训练框架，将语言学习任务与标准下一词预测结合。受人类语言习得启发，将原始文本转换为结构化输入-输出对，提供明确的语法刺激

Result: 在原始文本和L2T数据混合预训练的语言模型，在语法能力基准测试中表现更好且学习更快，同时在通用推理任务上保持竞争力

Conclusion: L2T框架能有效提升语言模型的语法能力，加速语法习得过程，同时不损害通用推理性能，为语言模型预训练提供了新方向

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are pre-trained on raw text datasets to generate text sequences token-by-token. While this approach facilitates the learning of world knowledge and reasoning, it does not explicitly optimize for linguistic competence. To bridge this gap, we propose L2T, a pre-training framework integrating Language Learning Tasks alongside standard next-token prediction. Inspired by human language acquisition, L2T transforms raw text into structured input-output pairs to provide explicit linguistic stimulation. Pre-training LMs on a mixture of raw text and L2T data not only improves overall performance on linguistic competence benchmarks but accelerates its acquisition, while maintaining competitive performance on general reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: LLMs在时间序列分类中表现不佳主要是提示评估方法的限制，而非模型缺乏时间结构理解能力。通过线性探针方法，LLMs的内部表示展现出强大的时间序列分类能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于提示的评估显示LLMs在时间序列分类上表现不佳，这引发了对LLMs是否真正理解时间结构的质疑。研究者想探究这种表现不佳是源于模型能力不足，还是评估方法的局限性。

Method: 采用对比研究方法：1) 使用传统的零样本提示方法评估LLMs的时间序列分类性能；2) 使用线性探针直接分析LLMs内部表示的时间序列分类能力；3) 进行分层分析，研究时间序列信息在transformer各层的分布；4) 探索视觉和多模态输入对时间序列理解的影响。

Result: 零样本提示方法F1分数仅为0.15-0.26（接近随机水平），而线性探针方法将F1分数提升至0.61-0.67，达到甚至超越了专门的时间序列模型性能。分层分析显示，类别区分性的时间序列信息在早期transformer层就已出现，且视觉和多模态输入能增强这种信息。

Conclusion: 当前基于提示的评估方法严重低估了LLMs对时间序列的理解能力。LLMs内部确实编码了有意义的时间结构信息，但提示生成机制未能有效提取这些信息。这表明需要开发更有效的评估方法来准确衡量LLMs的真实能力。

Abstract: Prompt-based evaluations suggest that large language models (LLMs) perform poorly on time series classification, raising doubts about whether they encode meaningful temporal structure. We show that this conclusion reflects limitations of prompt-based generation rather than the model's representational capacity by directly comparing prompt outputs with linear probes over the same internal representations. While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs. Together, these results demonstrate a systematic mismatch between what LLMs internally represent and what prompt-based evaluation reveals, leading current evaluations to underestimate their time series understanding.

Result: 在十个开放模型上的实验显示：当前LLMs在流行病学推理上表现有限，多步推理最具挑战性；模型排名在不同子集间变化；规模大小不能预测成功；思维链提示对多步推理有益但其他方面效果不一

Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

TL;DR: SegNSP将线性文本分割重构为下一句预测任务，通过标签无关的NSP方法和分割感知损失函数，在两个数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性文本分割是NLP中长期存在的问题，但由于定义主题边界的复杂性、话语结构的可变性以及平衡局部连贯性与全局上下文的需求，该任务仍然具有挑战性。这些困难阻碍了摘要、信息检索和问答等下游应用的发展。

Method: 提出SegNSP，将线性文本分割重构为下一句预测任务。采用标签无关的NSP方法，预测下一句是否继续当前主题，无需显式主题标签。通过分割感知损失函数结合更难负采样，更好地捕捉话语连续性。

Result: 在CitiLink-Minutes数据集上达到B-F1 0.79，与人工标注的主题转换高度一致；在WikiSection数据集上达到B-F1 0.65，比最强的可复现基线TopSeg高出0.17个绝对点。

Conclusion: 结果表明SegNSP具有竞争力和鲁棒性，证明了建模句子间连续性对于提高分割质量和支持下游NLP应用的有效性。

Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.

TL;DR: SMRA：首个结合道德原理作为直接监督的自解释仇恨言论检测框架，通过注意力对齐提升模型鲁棒性、可解释性和文化情境化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型依赖表层词汇特征，容易受虚假相关性影响，缺乏鲁棒性、文化情境化和可解释性。需要一种能引导模型关注道德相关内容而非虚假词汇模式的方法。

Method: 提出监督道德原理注意力（SMRA）框架，基于道德基础理论，将token级注意力与专家标注的道德原理对齐，将道德原理监督直接整合到训练目标中，产生内在可解释的上下文解释。同时创建了HateBRMoralXplain巴西葡萄牙语基准数据集。

Result: 在二元仇恨言论检测和多标签道德情感分类任务中，SMRA持续提升性能（分别提升0.9和1.5 F1），同时显著增强解释忠实度（IoU F1提升7.4个百分点，Token F1提升5.0个百分点）。解释更简洁，充分性提升2.3个百分点，公平性保持稳定。

Conclusion: SMRA通过道德原理监督的注意力对齐，在不牺牲性能或公平性的前提下，实现了更忠实、可解释的仇恨言论检测模型，为文化情境化的内容审核提供了新方法。

Abstract: Hate speech detection models rely on surface-level lexical features, increasing vulnerability to spurious correlations and limiting robustness, cultural contextualization, and interpretability. We propose Supervised Moral Rationale Attention (SMRA), the first self-explaining hate speech detection framework to incorporate moral rationales as direct supervision for attention alignment. Based on Moral Foundations Theory, SMRA aligns token-level attention with expert-annotated moral rationales, guiding models to attend to morally salient spans rather than spurious lexical patterns. Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations. To support our framework, we also introduce HateBRMoralXplain, a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark dataset annotated with hate labels, moral categories, token-level moral rationales, and socio-political metadata. Across binary hate speech detection and multi-label moral sentiment classification, SMRA consistently improves performance (e.g., +0.9 and +1.5 F1, respectively) while substantially enhancing explanation faithfulness, increasing IoU F1 (+7.4 pp) and Token F1 (+5.0 pp). Although explanations become more concise, sufficiency improves (+2.3 pp) and fairness remains stable, indicating more faithful rationales without performance or bias trade-offs

TL;DR: CALM框架通过解耦任务语义与文化概念，利用对比学习构建文化集群，并通过MoE机制自适应整合，赋予语言模型文化自我意识，实现持续适应与自我修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将文化视为静态背景知识，忽视了文化的动态演化特性，导致在需要真正文化敏感性的下游任务中可靠性不足。

Method: CALM框架：1) 解耦任务语义与显性文化概念及潜在文化信号；2) 通过对比学习将文化信号塑造成结构化文化集群；3) 通过跨注意力对齐建立细粒度文化特征交互；4) 通过Mixture-of-Experts机制沿文化特定维度自适应整合；5) 构建文化基础内部身份状态；6) 通过自我提示反思学习实现持续适应与自我修正。

Result: 在多个跨文化基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CALM始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CALM框架成功赋予语言模型文化自我意识，能够更好地理解和适应动态变化的文化语境，在需要文化敏感性的任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Cultural awareness in language models is the capacity to understand and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: SESS：基于子模函数理论的评估子集选择方法，用于提升提示优化的效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动提示优化依赖小规模评估子集的任务性能作为反馈信号，但现有方法通常将评估子集选择视为实现细节，缺乏理论指导

Method: 提出SESS方法，将评估子集选择问题形式化为最大化目标集合函数，证明在温和条件下该函数具有单调性和子模性，从而可以使用贪心算法获得理论保证

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH和GPQA-Diamond数据集上，子模选择的评估子集相比随机或启发式基线能够产生更好的优化提示

Conclusion: 评估子集选择对提示优化至关重要，基于子模函数理论的方法能够提供理论保证并提升优化效果

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization reduces manual prompt engineering, but relies on task performance measured on a small, often randomly sampled evaluation subset as its main source of feedback signal. Despite this, how to select that evaluation subset is usually treated as an implementation detail. We study evaluation subset selection for prompt optimization from a principled perspective and propose SESS, a submodular evaluation subset selection method. We frame selection as maximizing an objective set function and show that, under mild conditions, it is monotone and submodular, enabling greedy selection with theoretical guarantees. Across GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA-Diamond, submodularly selected evaluation subsets can yield better optimized prompts than random or heuristic baselines.

TL;DR: 提出KR-Test框架，用于区分SFT中事实学习与语言风格模仿，通过对比样本评估知识保留而非仅依赖困惑度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT依赖验证集困惑度监控训练，但困惑度混淆了语言风格模仿与事实知识内化，需要更精准的评估方法区分两者

Method: 引入KR-Test框架：1) 自动生成对比样本，比较正确与错误续写的似然偏好；2) 无需指令调优或生成解码；3) 通过"盲测vs.先知"基线分析验证框架完整性；4) 应用于LoRA训练动态分析

Result: KR-Test能有效区分语言收敛与知识保留，揭示两者在微调过程中的解离现象，增强训练动态的可解释性

Conclusion: KR-Test为SFT提供了轻量级、基于语料的评估框架，能更精准监控知识内化过程，优于仅依赖困惑度的传统方法

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.

TL;DR: RPAM通过层间模型融合实现自适应推理，将长链思维模型与短链思维模型结合，无需重新训练即可在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型为每个查询生成冗长的推理路径，导致不必要的计算和延迟。现有的加速方法要么需要重新训练模型成本高昂，要么依赖复杂的提示工程且对输入敏感

Method: 提出推理模式对齐融合(RPAM)：1)构建小规模模式标记校准集为每个查询分配适当推理模式；2)通过特征对齐优化层间融合系数，使融合模型的中间表示与选定模型对齐；3)使用对比目标将表示推离非选定模型

Result: 在七个广泛使用的推理基准测试中，RPAM显著降低了推理成本，同时保持了强大的性能表现

Conclusion: RPAM提供了一种轻量级的模型融合方法，无需从头训练或大规模额外数据即可实现自适应推理，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖BERT等外部分类器预测LLM输出质量，但存在上下文窗口有限、表示能力受限、额外计算开销等问题，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 提出IntroLM方法：1) 引入内省令牌让模型在预填充阶段预测输出质量；2) 使用令牌条件LoRA，仅在内省令牌时激活，保持主干模型行为不变；3) 无需外部评估器

Result: 在问答基准测试中，IntroLM应用于Qwen3 8B模型，成功预测的ROC AUC达到90%，比DeBERTa分类器提升14%；集成到多模型路由系统后，延迟降低33%，大模型使用减少50%，同时保持可靠性

Conclusion: IntroLM提供了一种高效、轻量的方法让LLM自我评估输出质量，显著提升路由系统的成本性能权衡，为LLM部署提供了实用的质量预测解决方案

Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准要么评估纯文本对话的多会话记忆，要么评估局部上下文中的多模态理解，无法评估多模态记忆如何在长期对话轨迹中被保留、组织和演化。因此需要一个新的基准来评估MLLM代理的多模态长期对话记忆能力。

Method: 提出了Mem-Gallery基准，包含高质量的多会话对话，基于视觉和文本信息，具有长交互时间和丰富的多模态依赖关系。在此基础上，提出了一个系统评估框架，从三个功能维度评估关键记忆能力：记忆提取和测试时适应、记忆推理、记忆知识管理。

Result: 通过对13个记忆系统进行广泛基准测试，揭示了几个关键发现：明确的多模态信息保留和记忆组织的必要性、记忆推理和知识管理方面的持续局限性，以及当前模型的效率瓶颈。

Conclusion: Mem-Gallery基准填补了多模态长期对话记忆评估的空白，揭示了当前MLLM代理在记忆能力方面的关键挑战和局限性，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频-语言模型在通用音频理解上表现良好，但缺乏个性化支持（如针对特定说话者的问答），而人类决策依赖个人上下文，需要弥补这一差距

Method: 形式化定义PALM任务，创建首个多说话者场景的基准PALM-Bench，对代表性开源LALMs进行实验，评估训练无关提示和监督微调策略

Result: 现有方法虽有改进，但在个性化知识建模和跨任务鲁棒迁移方面仍有限制，需要更有效的解决方案

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的个性化音频-语言模型方法，PALM-Bench为未来研究提供了结构化评估框架

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in audio understanding and generation. Yet, our extensive benchmarking reveals that their behavior is largely generic (e.g., summarizing spoken content) and fails to adequately support personalized question answering (e.g., summarizing what my best friend says). In contrast, human conditions their interpretation and decision-making on each individual's personal context. To bridge this gap, we formalize the task of Personalized LALMs (PALM) for recognizing personal concepts and reasoning within personal context. Moreover, we create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to foster the methodological advances in PALM and enable structured evaluation on several tasks across multi-speaker scenarios. Our extensive experiments on representative open-source LALMs, show that existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies, while yield improvements, remains limited in modeling personalized knowledge and transferring them across tasks robustly. Data and code will be released.

Abstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.

Motivation: 当前LLM向自主代理发展推动了深度研究的进展，但检索后的信息整合阶段（需要消化大量上下文并将碎片化证据整合为连贯的长篇报告）由于开放式写作的主观性而缺乏客观评估

Method: 利用高质量调查论文作为黄金标准，逆向工程研究请求并从其参考文献构建"Oracle Contexts"以隔离检索噪声；提出细粒度评估协议，使用通用检查清单（事实覆盖）和约束检查清单（结构组织），将主观判断转化为可验证指标

Result: 在96个任务上的实验表明，从数百篇参考文献中整合信息仍然是一个重大挑战；代理式的计划-写作工作流显著优于单轮生成，有效减少幻觉并提高对复杂结构约束的遵守

Conclusion: DeepSynth-Eval填补了LLM信息整合能力评估的空白，证明了代理式工作流在复杂信息整合任务中的优势，为未来研究提供了客观的评估框架

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards autonomous agents has catalyzed progress in Deep Research. While retrieval capabilities are well-benchmarked, the post-retrieval synthesis stage--where agents must digest massive amounts of context and consolidate fragmented evidence into coherent, long-form reports--remains under-evaluated due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing "Oracle Contexts" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge. Our results demonstrate that agentic plan-and-write workflows significantly outperform single-turn generation, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving adherence to complex structural constraints.

TL;DR: LLMs在多层推理中，后续跳答案实体可能比桥接实体更早解码，出现"层序反转"现象，这与传统的跳对齐假设相悖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多跳推理上表现良好，但其内部如何组合多个事实仍不清楚。现有研究提出的"跳对齐电路假设"认为桥接实体在深层计算，但这一假设在真实世界查询中可能不成立。

Method: 提出"概率性回忆-提取"框架，将多跳推理建模为浅层MLP层的广泛概率性回忆，随后在深层注意力层进行选择性提取。通过系统探测分析验证该框架。

Result: 发现层序反转现象：后续跳答案实体比桥接实体更早解码，且随着总跳数增加而增强。该框架能解释先前层解码证据、思维链增益，并诊断多跳失败原因。

Conclusion: 多跳推理不是简单的跳对齐序列处理，而是浅层广泛回忆与深层选择性提取的结合。这为理解LLM内部推理机制提供了新视角，并有助于诊断多跳失败。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding and leveraging long-range conversational memory, existing benchmarks still lack systematic evaluation of large language models(LLMs) across diverse memory dimensions, particularly in multi-session settings. In this work, we propose EvolMem, a new benchmark for assessing multi-session memory capabilities of LLMs and agent systems. EvolMem is grounded in cognitive psychology and encompasses both declarative and non-declarative memory, further decomposed into multiple fine-grained abilities. To construct the benchmark, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that consists of topic-initiated generation and narrative-inspired transformations. This framework enables scalable generation of multi-session conversations with controllable complexity, accompanied by sample-specific evaluation guidelines. Extensive evaluation reveals that no LLM consistently outperforms others across all memory dimensions. Moreover, agent memory mechanisms do not necessarily enhance LLMs' capabilities and often exhibit notable efficiency limitations. Data and code will be released at https://github.com/shenye7436/EvolMem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估通常孤立地测量隐私态度或共享意图，难以确定模型的表达价值观是否能像真实人类行为一样共同预测其下游数据共享行动。需要一种方法来评估LLMs在隐私关注和亲社会动机相互竞争的情况下，价值观与行为是否一致。

Method: 1. 引入基于上下文的评估协议：在有限的历史记录会话中顺序管理隐私态度、亲社会性和数据共享接受度的标准化问卷；2. 使用多组结构方程建模分析隐私关注和亲社会性对数据共享的影响关系；3. 提出价值观-行为对齐率指标，通过路径层面的证据聚合来评估预期符号的一致性。

Result: 在多个LLMs中观察到稳定但模型特定的隐私-PSA-AoDS特征，以及在价值观-行为对齐方面存在显著异质性。不同模型在隐私关注和亲社会动机影响数据共享决策的方式上表现出不同的模式。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种系统评估LLMs在复杂决策场景中价值观-行为对齐的方法，揭示了不同模型在隐私与亲社会冲突下的决策模式差异，为理解LLMs的决策机制和价值观一致性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.

Motivation: 传统思维链推理存在暴露偏差和错误累积问题，早期错误会在自回归解码中不可逆地传播，限制了多步数学问题求解的效果。

Method: 提出DiffCoT框架，将思维链推理重构为迭代去噪过程；采用滑动窗口机制在推理步骤层面集成扩散原理；引入因果扩散噪声调度以保持因果一致性；保留token级自回归特性。

Result: 在三个多步思维链推理基准测试和不同模型骨干上的实验表明，DiffCoT持续优于现有的思维链偏好优化方法，显著提升了推理的鲁棒性和纠错能力。

Conclusion: DiffCoT通过扩散风格的迭代去噪框架有效解决了思维链推理中的错误传播问题，为多步数学推理提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves multi-step mathematical problem solving in large language models but remains vulnerable to exposure bias and error accumulation, as early mistakes propagate irreversibly through autoregressive decoding. In this work, we propose DiffCoT, a diffusion-styled CoT framework that reformulates CoT reasoning as an iterative denoising process. DiffCoT integrates diffusion principles at the reasoning-step level via a sliding-window mechanism, enabling unified generation and retrospective correction of intermediate steps while preserving token-level autoregression. To maintain causal consistency, we further introduce a causal diffusion noise schedule that respects the temporal structure of reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on three multi-step CoT reasoning benchmarks across diverse model backbones demonstrate that DiffCoT consistently outperforms existing CoT preference optimization methods, yielding improved robustness and error-correction capability in CoT reasoning.

Result: 发现：1）概念电路能显著反映概念学习和遗忘；2）概念电路呈现阶段性时间模式；3）学习增益大的概念后续遗忘更严重；4）语义相似概念干扰更强；5）概念知识可迁移性不同

Conclusion: 研究提供了概念学习动态的电路级视角，为设计更可解释和鲁棒的概念感知训练策略提供了信息，有助于理解LLMs如何获取和保留概念知识

Abstract: Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.

TL;DR: 开发了基于澳大利亚心理学和精神病学指南的PsychEthicsBench基准，用于评估LLMs在心理健康领域的伦理知识和行为响应，发现拒绝率是伦理行为的差指标，领域特定微调可能降低伦理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLMs在心理健康应用中的安全对齐主要依赖拒绝信号，但这种方法无法捕捉临床实践所需的细微行为。临床不恰当的拒绝可能被视为缺乏同理心并阻碍求助行为，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 基于澳大利亚心理学和精神病学指南开发PsychEthicsBench基准，包含多项选择和开放式任务，带有细粒度伦理标注，用于评估LLMs的伦理知识和行为响应。在14个模型上进行实证评估。

Result: 拒绝率是伦理行为的差指标，安全触发与临床适当性存在显著差异。领域特定微调可能降低伦理鲁棒性，多个专门化模型在伦理对齐方面表现不如其基础模型。

Conclusion: PsychEthicsBench为心理健康领域LLMs的系统性、司法管辖区感知评估提供了基础，鼓励该领域更负责任的发展。需要超越拒绝中心指标来评估临床适当性。

Abstract: The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into mental health applications necessitates robust frameworks for evaluating professional safety alignment. Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment. PsychEthicsBench provides a foundation for systematic, jurisdiction-aware evaluation of LLMs in mental health, encouraging more responsible development in this domain.

### [118] [OLA: Output Language Alignment in Code-Switched LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03589)
*Juhyun Oh,Haneul Yoo,Faiz Ghifari Haznitrama,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在代码切换交互中经常无法正确对齐输出语言，即使人类能清晰识别上下文线索。作者提出OLA基准测试评估此问题，发现前沿模型存在非英语响应偏见，且思维链提示无效，但少量代码切换感知DPO训练可显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言用户在对话中自然地进行代码切换（混合使用多种语言），但这对LLMs构成根本性挑战。当用户在提示中进行代码切换时，通常不会指定期望的响应语言，LLMs需要从上下文和语用线索推断输出语言。当前LLMs系统性地无法满足这一期望。

Method: 引入OLA（输出语言对齐）基准测试，专注于韩语-英语代码切换，涵盖从简单的句内混合到指令-内容不匹配的各种场景。测试前沿模型在代码切换交互中的表现，分析其偏见和不稳定性。使用思维链提示测试，并开发代码切换感知DPO训练方法（仅需约1K示例）。

Result: 前沿模型经常误解隐含的语言期望，表现出向非英语响应的偏见（即使线索对人类很清晰）。这种偏见在中文和印尼语对中也普遍存在。模型还表现出不稳定性，如中途切换语言和语言侵入。思维链提示无法解决这些错误，表明模型缺乏对输出语言的语用推理能力。但代码切换感知DPO训练能显著减少不对齐问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码切换交互中的失败源于对齐不足而非根本性限制。少量针对性训练即可显著改善。研究强调需要将多语言LLMs与用户在现实世界代码切换交互中的隐含期望对齐。

Abstract: Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Graph Reasoning框架，让大语言模型在开放域问答中构建图结构推理过程，提升推理一致性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的推理过程通常是线性的且逻辑不一致，而现实世界推理需要整合多个前提并并行解决子问题。现有方法如思维链以线性文本形式表达推理，虽然看似连贯但常导致不一致结论。现有方法依赖外部提供的图结构，未探索LLM如何构建和使用自己的图结构推理。

Method: 提出Self-Graph Reasoning框架，使LLM在生成最终答案前将推理过程显式表示为结构化图。构建图结构推理数据集，将多个候选推理图合并为精炼的图结构用于模型训练。

Result: 在五个问答基准测试中，SGR持续提升推理一致性，相比基础模型获得17.74%的性能提升。使用SGR微调的LLaMA-3.3-70B模型表现与GPT-4o相当，超越Claude-3.5-Haiku。

Conclusion: 图结构推理能有效提升大语言模型在开放域问答中的推理一致性和性能，Self-Graph Reasoning框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

Motivation: 现有事实性验证研究主要进行二元判断（正确/错误），无法区分不同程度的错误严重性，限制了其在细粒度评估和偏好优化等应用中的效用

Method: 提出Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA)混合框架，结合生成模型的代理搜索能力和判别模型的精确评分能力，并构建FGVeriBench基准作为细粒度事实性验证的测试平台

Result: 在FGVeriBench上的实验结果表明，DiVA在通用和多跳问题的事实性验证方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: DiVA框架通过结合生成和判别模型的优势，有效解决了细粒度事实性验证的挑战，为LLM事实性评估提供了更精细的工具

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), their factuality remains a critical challenge, fueling growing interest in factuality verification. Existing research on factuality verification primarily conducts binary judgments (e.g., correct or incorrect), which fails to distinguish varying degrees of error severity. This limits its utility for applications such as fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA), a hybrid framework that synergizes the agentic search capabilities of generative models with the precise scoring aptitude of discriminative models. We also construct a new benchmark, FGVeriBench, as a robust testbed for fine-grained factuality verification. Experimental results on FGVeriBench demonstrate that our DiVA significantly outperforms existing methods on factuality verification for both general and multi-hop questions.

*Binh Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 音频语言模型为音频深度伪造检测提供了可解释性，但需要评估其在对抗攻击下的推理鲁棒性。研究发现推理并不总是增强鲁棒性：对感知鲁棒的模型，推理起保护作用；对其他模型则造成性能损失，语言攻击会降低认知一致性。即使分类失败，高认知失调也可作为潜在操纵的警报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频语言模型为音频深度伪造检测提供了可解释性，超越了传统的黑盒分类器。但需要新的鲁棒性分析框架来评估其在对抗攻击下的推理鲁棒性，而不仅仅是最终预测结果的变化。

Method: 提出了一个法证审计框架，从三个相互关联的维度评估ALMs在对抗攻击下的推理鲁棒性：声学感知、认知一致性和认知失调。通过系统分析研究推理在对抗攻击下的作用。

Result: 研究发现显式推理并不普遍增强鲁棒性。对于声学感知鲁棒的模型，推理起到防御"盾牌"作用；对其他模型则造成性能"税负"，特别是在语言攻击下会降低认知一致性并提高攻击成功率。即使分类失败，高认知失调也可作为潜在操纵的"沉默警报"。

Conclusion: 这项工作对推理在法证音频深度伪造分析中的作用及其脆弱性进行了关键评估，揭示了推理在对抗攻击下的复杂作用，为未来可解释音频深度伪造检测系统的设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) offer a promising shift towards explainable audio deepfake detections (ADDs), moving beyond \textit{black-box} classifiers by providing some level of transparency into their predictions via reasoning traces. This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.

Motivation: 首次系统比较大型推理模型（LRMs）是否比非推理LLMs更适合作为评估者，探索LRMs在判断任务中的优势和局限性

Method: 通过实证分析比较LRMs和非推理LLMs在判断任务中的表现，并提出PlanJudge策略（让模型在执行前生成明确的评估计划）来减轻偏见

Result: 1) LRMs在判断准确性上优于非推理LLMs，尤其在推理密集型任务中；2) LRMs在评估情境中指令遵循能力更强；3) LRMs对针对判断任务的对抗攻击更具鲁棒性；4) LRMs仍存在强烈的表面质量偏见；PlanJudge能显著减轻LRMs和标准LLMs的偏见

Conclusion: LRMs在多个方面优于非推理LLMs作为评估者，但仍存在偏见问题；PlanJudge作为一种简单有效的策略，能显著改善模型的偏见问题

Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic comparison investigating whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are superior judge to non-reasoning LLMs. Our empirical analysis yields four key findings: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in terms of judgment accuracy, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks; 2) LRMs demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities in evaluation contexts; 3) LRMs exhibit enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks targeting judgment tasks; 4) However, LRMs still exhibit strong biases in superficial quality. To improve the robustness against biases, we propose PlanJudge, an evaluation strategy that prompts the model to generate an explicit evaluation plan before execution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments demonstrate that PlanJudge significantly mitigates biases in both LRMs and standard LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在与动态环境交互时需要持续学习新任务，但面临灾难性遗忘问题（稳定性-可塑性困境）。作者认为这一困境源于未能明确区分任务间共享的通用知识和任务特定干扰引入的冲突知识。

Method: 提出Agent-Dice参数融合框架，采用两阶段知识解耦过程：1）几何共识过滤修剪冲突梯度；2）基于曲率的重要性加权放大共享语义。该框架基于方向共识评估，提供理论分析验证融合方案的有效性。

Result: 在GUI智能体和工具使用智能体领域的广泛实验表明，Agent-Dice展现出卓越的持续学习性能，同时具有最小的计算开销和参数更新。

Conclusion: Agent-Dice通过明确区分共享知识和冲突知识，有效解决了LLM智能体持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，为智能体的长期适应性提供了理论支持和实用框架。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents significantly extend the utility of LLMs by interacting with dynamic environments. However, enabling agents to continually learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this work, we argue that this dilemma fundamentally arises from the failure to explicitly distinguish between common knowledge shared across tasks and conflicting knowledge introduced by task-specific interference. To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments on GUI agents and tool-use agent domains demonstrate that Agent-Dice exhibits outstanding continual learning performance with minimal computational overhead and parameter updates.

Motivation: 传统文本情感分析方法将情感视为个体说话者的确定性点估计，无法捕捉人际互动中固有的主观性、潜在模糊性和序列耦合特性。需要一种能够表征情感动态协调的方法来理解人际关系的实时构建。

Method: 提出LLM-MC-Affect框架：1）将情感建模为情感空间上的连续潜在概率分布；2）利用随机LLM解码和蒙特卡洛估计近似这些分布；3）生成高保真情感轨迹，量化中心情感趋势和感知模糊性；4）通过序列互相关和基于斜率的指标分析人际耦合。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解人际动态建立了可扩展且可部署的途径，提供了一个可推广的解决方案，不仅适用于教育领域，还可扩展到更广泛的社会和行为研究。

Abstract: Emotional coordination is a core property of human interaction that shapes how relational meaning is constructed in real time. While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.

Result: 训练速度提升最高达6.46倍，目标语言性能提升最高6.2%，同时有效保持了英语等源语言能力

Conclusion: ELO方法为多语言大模型的持续预训练提供了一种高效解决方案，在显著加速训练的同时保持模型性能

Abstract: We propose an efficient layer-specific optimization (ELO) method designed to enhance continual pretraining (CP) for specific languages in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). This approach addresses the common challenges of high computational cost and degradation of source language performance associated with traditional CP. The ELO method consists of two main stages: (1) ELO Pretraining, where a small subset of specific layers, identified in our experiments as the critically important first and last layers, are detached from the original MLLM and trained with the target language. This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.

TL;DR: SyncThink是一种无需训练、即插即用的解码方法，通过监控模型自身的推理转换信号来提前终止推理，显著减少Chain-of-Thought的推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought提示虽然能提升推理能力，但会产生冗长的推理轨迹，大幅增加推理成本。需要一种方法在不修改模型权重的情况下减少CoT的开销。

Method: 基于发现答案token对早期推理关注较弱，而主要关注特殊token"/think"这一信息瓶颈现象，SyncThink监控模型自身的推理转换信号，在适当时机终止推理过程。

Result: 在GSM8K、MMLU、GPQA和BBH四个数据集上，SyncThink相比完整CoT解码，在保持相近准确率（62.00% vs 61.22%）的同时，将生成token数从2141减少到656，延迟从92.01秒降低到28.68秒。在GPQA等长视野任务上，还能通过防止过度思考获得最高+8.1的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: SyncThink是一种有效的训练免费解码方法，能够显著减少CoT推理的开销，同时保持甚至提升模型性能，特别适用于长视野推理任务。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often produces long and redundant traces that substantially increase inference cost. We present SyncThink, a training-free and plug-and-play decoding method that reduces CoT overhead without modifying model weights. We find that answer tokens attend weakly to early reasoning and instead focus on the special token "/think", indicating an information bottleneck. Building on this observation, SyncThink monitors the model's own reasoning-transition signal and terminates reasoning. Experiments on GSM8K, MMLU, GPQA, and BBH across three DeepSeek-R1 distilled models show that SyncThink achieves 62.00 percent average Top-1 accuracy using 656 generated tokens and 28.68 s latency, compared to 61.22 percent, 2141 tokens, and 92.01 s for full CoT decoding. On long-horizon tasks such as GPQA, SyncThink can further yield up to +8.1 absolute accuracy by preventing over-thinking.

Method: 提出三个组件：模态感知温度校准对齐相似度尺度；可控负样本课程学习与去偏关注混淆负样本；批白化与协方差正则化匹配跨模态几何结构

Conclusion: E5-omni轻量级显式对齐方法能有效提升全模态嵌入模型的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.

Conclusion: eTracer框架通过声明级基础化实现了可追溯的文本生成，提高了生物医学领域系统生成响应的可验证性和可信度，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: How can system-generated responses be efficiently verified, especially in the high-stakes biomedical domain? To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence. Through post-hoc grounding, each response claim is aligned with contextual evidence that either supports or contradicts it. Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency. The code and data are available at https://github.com/chubohao/eTracer.

TL;DR: DisastQA是一个大规模灾难管理问答基准，包含3000个经过验证的问题，涵盖8种灾害类型，用于评估模型在不确定和冲突信息下的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试基于干净证据构建，无法捕捉灾难管理中需要处理不确定和冲突信息的现实场景，因此需要专门针对灾难管理的问答基准。

Method: 通过人机协作流水线构建基准，采用分层抽样确保平衡覆盖；包含2000个多项选择题和1000个开放式问题；在从闭卷到噪声证据整合的不同证据条件下评估模型；为开放式问答提出基于关键点的人类验证评估协议。

Result: 实验评估20个模型发现：1) 与MMLU-Pro等通用排行榜存在显著差异；2) 在干净设置下，近期开源模型接近专有系统性能；3) 在现实噪声下性能急剧下降，暴露灾难响应的可靠性差距。

Conclusion: DisastQA基准揭示了当前模型在灾难管理场景中的局限性，特别是在处理不确定和冲突信息时的可靠性问题，强调了开发更鲁棒推理系统的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate question answering (QA) in disaster management requires reasoning over uncertain and conflicting information, a setting poorly captured by existing benchmarks built on clean evidence. We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response. All code, data, and evaluation resources are available at https://github.com/TamuChen18/DisastQA_open.

*Weiqi Liu,Yongliang Miao,Haiyan Zhao,Yanguang Liu,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuronScope：一个多智能体框架，通过迭代激活引导过程解决LLM神经元多义性解释问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中神经元普遍存在多义性（单个神经元响应多个不同语义概念），现有单次解释方法难以准确捕捉这种多概念行为

Method: 提出NeuronScope多智能体框架，将神经元解释重构为迭代的激活引导过程：将神经元激活分解为原子语义组件，聚类成不同语义模式，并使用神经元激活反馈迭代优化每个解释

Result: 实验表明NeuronScope能够揭示隐藏的多义性，相比单次基线方法产生具有显著更高激活相关性的解释

Conclusion: NeuronScope通过多智能体迭代方法有效解决了LLM神经元多义性解释的挑战，为神经元级解释提供了更准确的方法

Abstract: Neuron-level interpretation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally challenged by widespread polysemanticity, where individual neurons respond to multiple distinct semantic concepts. Existing single-pass interpretation methods struggle to faithfully capture such multi-concept behavior. In this work, we propose NeuronScope, a multi-agent framework that reformulates neuron interpretation as an iterative, activation-guided process. NeuronScope explicitly deconstructs neuron activations into atomic semantic components, clusters them into distinct semantic modes, and iteratively refines each explanation using neuron activation feedback. Experiments demonstrate that NeuronScope uncovers hidden polysemanticity and produces explanations with significantly higher activation correlation compared to single-pass baselines.

TL;DR: STEPS框架通过技能分类熵基后训练数据合成，解决LLMs组合泛化中的数据瓶颈问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和基于代理的系统在组合泛化方面存在困难，主要原因是复杂技能组合遵循长尾幂律分布，形成了数据瓶颈，限制了指令跟随性能和代理任务的泛化能力

Method: 提出STEPS框架：1）使用结构信息理论发现技能间的潜在关系，构建可解释的层次化技能分类；2）将数据合成建模为约束信息最大化问题，选择在层次结构中最大化边际结构信息同时保持语义连贯性的技能组合

Result: 在具有挑战性的指令跟随基准测试中，STEPS优于现有的数据合成基线方法，并在下游基于代理的评估中展现出改进的组合泛化能力

Conclusion: STEPS框架通过构建技能分类和熵基数据合成，有效解决了LLMs组合泛化中的数据瓶颈问题，提高了模型在复杂任务中的表现

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.

*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出FSLR训练框架，专注于提升LLMs在数学问题解决中的逻辑关系理解能力，相比CoT-SFT在性能和效率上均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在数学问题解决中主要依赖模式匹配和记忆，而非真正的逻辑推理。研究发现逻辑关系理解错误占错误预测的90%以上，而CoT-SFT无法有效减少这类错误。

Method: 提出First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR)框架，专注于训练模型识别第一步规划：确定使用哪些变量和应用哪种操作。通过单独训练这一步骤，为逻辑关系理解提供显式监督。

Result: FSLR在多个模型和数据集上一致优于CoT-SFT，在分布内和分布外设置下平均提升3.2%和4.6%。训练速度提升4-6倍，训练token消耗减少80%以上。

Conclusion: FSLR通过专注于逻辑关系理解的第一步规划，有效解决了LLMs在数学推理中的瓶颈，提供了更高效、更有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个包含四个组件（新颖性、价值、一致性、共鸣）和十一个子组件的结构化评估框架，用于评估AI故事生成的创造力，通过控制实验和众包研究发现创造力评估是分层的而非累积的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的评估指标无法捕捉创造力的主观性，因此需要一个新的框架来更全面地评估AI生成的创意文本。

Method: 使用"Spike Prompting"控制故事生成，通过115名读者的众包研究，分析不同创意组件如何影响即时和反思性的人类创造力判断。

Result: 创造力评估是分层的而非累积的，不同维度在不同判断阶段变得显著；反思性评估显著改变评分和评分者间一致性；该框架能揭示被基于参考评估所掩盖的创造力维度。

Conclusion: 提出的结构化评估框架能有效揭示创意文本生成中的创造力维度，为AI故事生成的评估提供了更全面的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating creative text generation remains a challenge because existing reference-based metrics fail to capture the subjective nature of creativity. We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation.

TL;DR: ADEPT提出了一种自适应动态早退机制，可在预填充和生成阶段实现token级别的动态早退，通过解耦跳过层的KV缓存依赖来提升Transformer推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早退策略要么只适用于生成阶段的第一个token，要么只适用于预填充阶段的提示级别，导致跳过层的KV缓存成为后续token生成的瓶颈，限制了早退的效益。

Method: 提出ADEPT方法，包含自适应token级别早退机制，根据token复杂度动态调整计算；通过解耦跳过层的序列依赖关系来优化KV生成过程，使token级别早退更加实用。

Result: 实验结果显示，ADEPT在语言生成任务中效率提升高达25%，在下游分类任务中实现4倍加速，性能提升高达45%。

Conclusion: ADEPT成功解决了现有早退策略的KV缓存瓶颈问题，实现了在预填充和生成阶段都能有效工作的动态早退机制，显著提升了Transformer模型的推理效率。

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过语义破坏实验揭示DeepSeek-OCR的性能主要依赖语言先验而非视觉OCR能力，当去除语言支持时性能从90%骤降至20%，且传统OCR方法比端到端方法更鲁棒，视觉token越少越依赖先验导致幻觉风险增加，当前光学压缩技术可能加剧长上下文瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-OCR声称通过光学2D映射实现高比例视觉-文本压缩，能解码超过输入视觉token十倍的文本token，这似乎为LLM长上下文瓶颈提供了有前景的解决方案。但作者质疑其性能究竟来自真正的视觉OCR能力还是语言先验的依赖，需要实证研究来界定其能力边界。

Method: 通过句子级和单词级语义破坏实验，隔离模型的固有OCR能力与语言先验。对比基准测试包括13个基线模型，分析不同视觉token数量下的性能变化，并进行上下文压力测试以评估模型极限。

Result: 结果显示：1) 无语言支持时，DeepSeek-OCR性能从约90%骤降至20%；2) 传统流水线OCR方法比端到端方法对语义扰动更鲁棒；3) 视觉token数量越少，模型越依赖先验，幻觉风险越高；4) 上下文压力测试显示模型在约10,000文本token处完全崩溃。

Conclusion: 当前光学压缩技术可能反而加剧长上下文瓶颈，而非解决它。研究为视觉-文本压缩范式的未来优化提供了关键见解，实证界定了DeepSeek-OCR的能力边界，并开源了所有数据、结果和脚本。

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: "Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm. We release all data, results and scripts used in this study at https://github.com/dududuck00/DeepSeekOCR.

Conclusion: MIND框架通过能力自适应机制成功解决了知识蒸馏中教师最优推理路径与学生模型能力不匹配的问题，实现了更好的领域性能和跨域泛化能力，为小型模型的推理能力提升提供了有效途径。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with remarkable capabilities in complex tasks through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, practical resource constraints have sparked interest in transferring these abilities to smaller models. However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's "optimal" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel "Teaching Assistant" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, and our sophisticated latent space analysis further confirms the mechanism of reasoning ability internalization.

Conclusion: 合成数据管道可以有效克服低资源语言中口吃语音数据稀缺的问题，为在代表性不足的语言中开发更具包容性的语音技术提供了可行方案

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition systems have achieved remarkable performance on fluent speech but continue to degrade significantly when processing stuttered speech, a limitation that is particularly acute for low-resource languages like Indonesian where specialized datasets are virtually non-existent. To overcome this scarcity, we propose a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic stuttered audio by injecting repetitions and prolongations into fluent text through a combination of rule-based transformations and large language models followed by text-to-speech synthesis. We apply this synthetic data to fine-tune a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model using transfer learning, enabling the architecture to adapt to dysfluent acoustic patterns without requiring large-scale real-world recordings. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted synthetic exposure consistently reduces recognition errors on stuttered speech while maintaining performance on fluent segments, validating the utility of synthetic data pipelines for developing more inclusive speech technologies in under-represented languages.

Abstract: The performance gap between closed-source and open-source large language models (LLMs) is largely attributed to disparities in access to high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework for the automated synthesis of sophisticated, research-grade instructional data. Our approach centers on a multi-agent workflow where collaborative AI agents simulate complex tool-integrated reasoning to generate diverse and high-fidelity data end-to-end. Leveraging this synthesized data, we develop a two-stage training strategy that integrates supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning method, designed to maximize model alignment and capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework empowers open-source models across multiple scales, enabling them to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the major deep research benchmark. This work provides a scalable and effective pathway for advancing open-source LLMs without relying on proprietary data or models.

Method: 提出新颖框架研究信息源偏好如何影响LLMs解决知识冲突，对13个开源LLMs进行全面、严格控制评估，并设计新方法减少重复偏差。

Result: LLMs偏好机构验证的信息源（如政府或报纸）而非个人和社交媒体信息，但重复效应可逆转这种偏好。提出的新方法能将重复偏差减少99.8%，同时保持至少88.8%的原始偏好。

Conclusion: LLMs在知识冲突中存在信息源偏好，但易受重复效应影响。提出的方法能有效减少重复偏差，维持一致的偏好判断。作者发布所有数据和代码以促进可信度和信息源偏好在知识密集型NLP中的未来研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.

Method: 研究覆盖10种语言，测试了1080种个性化提示组合，使用16个不同的语言模型生成了17,280个文本，分析个性化质量及其对文本可检测性的影响。

Result: 研究发现：1）针对不同人口群体和社交媒体平台的个性化质量存在语言差异；2）平台个性化对生成文本可检测性的影响更大，尤其是在个性化质量最高的英语中。

Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.

### [144] [Do LLM Self-Explanations Help Users Predict Model Behavior? Evaluating Counterfactual Simulatability with Pragmatic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03775)
*Pingjun Hong,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨LLM生成的自我解释是否能帮助用户预测模型行为，通过反事实模拟性评估，发现解释能提升模拟准确性，但效果受扰动策略和评估者能力影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能产生自我解释，但先前研究表明这些理由可能无法可靠反映模型的真实决策过程。本研究旨在探究这些解释是否仍能帮助用户预测模型行为，特别是通过反事实模拟性的操作化来评估。

Method: 使用StrategyQA数据集，评估人类和LLM评估者在有无访问模型的思维链或事后解释的情况下，预测模型对反事实后续问题答案的能力。比较LLM生成的反事实与基于语用学的扰动作为评估解释潜在有用性的替代测试案例构建方法。

Result: 自我解释能持续提升LLM评估者和人类的模拟准确性，但提升程度和稳定性强烈依赖于扰动策略和评估者能力。定性分析显示，访问解释能帮助人类在扰动问题上形成更准确的预测。

Conclusion: LLM生成的自我解释确实有助于用户预测模型行为，特别是在反事实模拟任务中，但其效果受多种因素影响，需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的评估方法和扰动策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.

*Marco Baroni,Emily Cheng,Iria deDios-Flores,Francesca Franzon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM表征的内在维度（ID）可作为语言复杂度的标记，能区分不同类型复杂度并揭示相似的语言处理阶段


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM表征的内在维度是否能够作为语言复杂度的标记，以及不同ID模式是否能够区分形式复杂度和功能复杂度

Method: 通过分析LLM各层表征的内在维度，对比形式复杂度（多从句协调/从属）和功能复杂度（右分支vs中心嵌入、明确vs模糊关系从句附着），使用表征相似性和层消融实验验证

Result: 形式复杂度差异在ID中明显反映，其出现时间与先前研究中识别的抽象语言处理阶段一致；功能复杂度差异也能被ID捕捉但较弱，且不与相同处理阶段相关；表征相似性和层消融实验证实相同趋势

Conclusion: ID是LLM中语言复杂度的有用标记，能够区分不同类型的复杂度，并指向不同LLM中相似的语言处理阶段

Abstract: We explore the intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations as a marker of linguistic complexity, asking if different ID profiles across LLM layers differentially characterize formal and functional complexity. We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.

TL;DR: HearSay基准测试首次系统评估音频大语言模型的隐私泄露风险，发现模型能从声纹中准确提取用户隐私属性，现有安全机制严重不足，推理过程会进一步放大风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型在理解和生成方面取得显著进展，但其潜在的隐私影响尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在探究ALLMs是否仅通过声学声纹就会无意中泄露用户隐私。

Method: 构建HearSay基准测试，包含超过22,000个真实世界音频片段，通过自动化分析和人工验证的严格流程确保数据质量。在基准上进行广泛实验，评估模型从声纹中提取隐私属性的能力、安全机制的有效性以及推理过程的影响。

Result: 1. 显著隐私泄露：ALLMs能从声纹中准确提取隐私属性，性别识别准确率达92.89%，并能有效分析社会属性。2. 安全机制不足：现有安全措施严重不足，大多数模型无法拒绝隐私侵入性请求，生理特征相关请求的拒绝率接近零。3. 推理放大风险：思维链推理在能力较强的模型中会通过揭示更深层的声学相关性而加剧隐私风险。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了音频大语言模型存在严重隐私漏洞，现有安全机制不足以保护用户隐私，特别是推理过程会进一步放大风险。这强调了针对隐私对齐的紧迫需求，需要开发更有效的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: While Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in understanding and generation, their potential privacy implications remain largely unexplored. This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment.

### [147] [Membox: Weaving Topic Continuity into Long-Range Memory for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03785)
*Dehao Tao,Guoliang Ma,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Membox是一个分层记忆架构，通过Topic Loom监控对话并将连续同主题轮次分组为"记忆盒"，再通过Trace Weaver链接成长范围事件时间线，显著提升LLM代理的时序推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理记忆系统遵循碎片化-补偿范式：先将对话流分解为孤立语句存储，再通过嵌入检索恢复连贯性。这种方法不可逆地破坏了叙事和因果流，并使检索偏向词汇相似性。需要一种能保持主题连续性的记忆架构。

Method: 提出membox分层记忆架构：1) Topic Loom以滑动窗口方式持续监控对话，将连续同主题轮次分组为连贯的"记忆盒"；2) Trace Weaver将密封的记忆盒链接成长范围事件时间线，恢复跨间断的宏观主题复现。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验显示，Membox在时序推理任务上达到68%的F1提升，优于Mem0、A-MEM等基线方法。同时仅使用现有方法所需上下文token的一小部分，实现了效率与效果的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模主题连续性，Membox提供了一种认知动机机制，既能增强LLM代理的连贯性，又能提高效率，为对话记忆系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

*Loris Schoenegger,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出新的选择相关性评分，用于评估训练数据影响估计中选择策略的有效性，发现常见策略常不如随机选择，并提出平衡影响力和代表性的新策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据影响估计方法量化训练文档对模型输出的贡献，可作为基于示例的解释来源。由于人类无法解释数千个文档，只能展示训练数据的小子集作为解释。选择哪些文档直接影响解释质量，但先前评估大多忽略了选择策略

Method: 提出新的选择相关性评分（retraining-free metric），量化一组示例对解释模型输出的有用性。通过微调实验验证该评分能预测示例集是支持还是削弱模型预测。基于此发现，提出平衡影响力和代表性的选择策略

Result: 验证了选择相关性评分能有效预测示例集对模型预测的影响。发现常见选择策略通常比随机选择表现更差。提出的平衡策略能比简单选择最高排名示例更好地利用选择预算

Conclusion: 训练数据影响估计中的选择策略对解释质量至关重要，需要专门评估。提出的选择相关性评分和平衡策略能改善基于示例的解释系统

Abstract: Training data influence estimation methods quantify the contribution of training documents to a model's output, making them a promising source of information for example-based explanations. As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出NeoAMT框架，通过Wiktionary搜索工具解决新词翻译问题，创建多语言数据集并开发强化学习训练方法提升翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新词感知机器翻译领域相对通用机器翻译研究不足，需要专门方法处理包含新词的源语句翻译问题

Method: 1. 从英语Wiktionary创建包含16种语言、75个翻译方向的新数据集；2. 基于Wiktionary构建搜索工具；3. 设计包含新颖奖励机制和自适应生成方法的强化学习训练框架，利用"翻译难度"提升翻译质量

Result: 构建了大规模多语言新词翻译数据集（约1000万条记录），开发了基于Wiktionary的搜索工具（约300万条清理记录），并提出了改进翻译代理性能的强化学习框架

Conclusion: NeoAMT框架通过结合Wiktionary搜索工具和强化学习训练，有效解决了新词感知机器翻译问题，为这一未充分探索的领域提供了系统解决方案

Abstract: Neologism-aware machine translation aims to translate source sentences containing neologisms into target languages. This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.

*Xiaoyu Luo,Yiyi Chen,Qiongxiu Li,Johannes Bjerva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM)框架，重新评估LLMs中的PII泄露问题，发现先前报告的PII泄露主要源于提示线索而非真实记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常将LLMs成功重建PII解释为记忆证据，但作者认为这可能是由提示诱导的泛化或模式补全导致，而非真正的记忆，需要更严谨的评估框架。

Method: 提出Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM)框架，通过控制提示-目标重叠线索来评估记忆。在32种语言上大规模重新评估PII泄露，包括逐字前缀-后缀补全、关联重建、无线索生成和成员推理等多种记忆范式。

Result: 当控制表面形式线索后，重建成功率显著下降；无线索生成和成员推理的真阳性率极低。先前报告的PII泄露效果主要源于直接表面形式线索而非真实记忆。

Conclusion: LLMs中的PII泄露应通过线索控制评估来可靠量化，先前观察到的泄露现象更多是线索驱动行为而非真实记忆，这对隐私相关记忆评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了VietMed-MCQ数据集，这是一个针对越南传统医学的多选题数据集，通过RAG管道生成并采用双重模型验证机制，包含3,190个问题，用于评估LLM在低资源医学领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用医学领域表现出色，但在越南传统医学等特定文化领域表现显著下降，主要原因是缺乏高质量的结构化基准数据集。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)管道生成多选题数据集，并引入双重模型验证机制进行一致性检查，通过独立答案验证确保推理一致性，数据集包含三个难度级别。

Result: 数据集包含3,190个问题，经过1名医学专家和4名学生验证，获得94.2%的批准率，组间一致性高(Fleiss' kappa = 0.82)。基准测试显示，具有中文先验知识的通用模型优于越南中心模型，但所有模型在复杂诊断推理方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: VietMed-MCQ数据集填补了越南传统医学领域的基准空白，促进了低资源医学领域的研究，揭示了跨语言概念转移的现象，并为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in general medical domains. However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过系统性的分层探测研究，发现Transformer模型中意义的"位置"取决于方法选择和架构约束，不同嵌入提取方法产生不同的意义分布模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型在何处编码心理学上有意义的内容，对于理论和实践都很重要。需要系统研究不同模型架构和嵌入提取方法如何影响心理语言学特征的编码位置。

Method: 对10个Transformer模型（包括编码器和解码器架构）进行分层探测研究，涵盖58个心理语言学特征，比较三种嵌入提取方法（上下文嵌入与孤立嵌入）。

Result: 1) 意义的明显定位强烈依赖于方法选择：上下文嵌入比孤立嵌入具有更高的特征选择性和不同的分层分布模式；2) 最终层表示很少是恢复心理语言学信息的最佳选择；3) 所有模型共享意义维度的深度排序模式：词汇属性较早达到峰值，体验和情感维度较晚达到峰值。

Conclusion: Transformer模型中意义的"位置"反映了方法选择与架构约束之间的相互作用，研究结果强调了在解释模型表示时需要谨慎考虑方法学因素。

Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.

Abstract: GUI agents that interact with graphical interfaces on behalf of users represent a promising direction for practical AI assistants. However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了AI文本检测方法，发现基于上下文的深度学习模型（如DistilBERT）在检测AI生成文本方面表现最佳，准确率达88.11%，ROC-AUC为0.96，优于传统机器学习方法。


<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，学生越来越多地将AI生成内容当作自己的作业提交，这违反了学术诚信。因此需要有效的方法来检测AI生成的文本。

Method: 使用HC3和DAIGT v2两个数据集构建统一基准，采用基于主题的数据分割防止信息泄露。评估了传统机器学习模型（TF-IDF逻辑回归）和深度学习模型（BiLSTM、DistilBERT）的性能。

Result: TF-IDF逻辑回归达到82.87%的准确率，BiLSTM达到88.86%，DistilBERT达到88.11%且ROC-AUC最高（0.96）。深度学习模型明显优于传统方法，上下文语义建模比词汇特征更有效。

Conclusion: 基于上下文的深度学习模型在AI文本检测中表现最佳，适当的数据分割对防止主题记忆化很重要。未来将扩展数据集多样性，使用参数高效微调方法，并探索更小的模型和硬件优化策略。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法缺乏语义基础的步骤级推理进度度量，导致LLMs无法区分必要推理和冗余验证，可能继续检查正确解甚至将正确轨迹推翻为错误答案。

Method: 引入无需训练的探测机制提取中间置信度和正确性，组合成步骤潜力信号；基于此提出步骤潜力优势估计(SPAE)，进行细粒度信用分配，放大潜力增益、惩罚潜力下降，并在潜力饱和后应用惩罚以鼓励及时终止。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPAE持续提高准确性同时显著减少响应长度，优于强RL基线和近期高效推理及token级优势估计方法。

Conclusion: SPAE通过步骤潜力信号提供细粒度推理过程监督，有效解决RLVR中的信用分配问题，实现更准确、高效的链式推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but outcome-based rewards lead to coarse-grained advantage estimation. While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/cii030/SPAE-RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格剪枝方法依赖顺序修订和不可靠的批判信号，容易丢失答案关键数据，需要更可靠的方法来提取紧凑子表以优化下游推理。

Method: TabTrim将表格剪枝转变为黄金轨迹监督的并行搜索：1）从黄金SQL查询执行过程中提取中间子表构建黄金剪枝轨迹；2）训练剪枝器和验证器使逐步剪枝结果对齐黄金轨迹；3）推理时并行搜索多个候选剪枝轨迹以识别最优子表。

Result: TabTrim-8B达到73.5%平均准确率，比最强基线提升3.2%，在WikiTQ上达到79.4%，在TableBench上达到61.2%，在多样化表格推理任务中实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: TabTrim通过黄金轨迹监督和并行搜索有效解决了现有表格剪枝方法的局限性，显著提升了表格问答性能，为表格推理任务提供了更可靠的剪枝框架。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.

Result: 在三个指令调优LLM和多种CPT策略中，优化与学习系统性偏离：损失单调下降而事实学习不稳定、非单调；获取的事实很少被巩固，学习强烈依赖先前暴露；OOD性能从早期epoch即开始退化；电路分析显示知识通路在epoch间快速重构

Conclusion: 损失优化与CPT中的学习进展不一致，需要基于任务级学习动态的停止标准评估，而非仅依赖损失指标

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.

TL;DR: PartisanLens：首个多语言超党派新闻标题数据集（西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语），用于检测超党派叙事和人口替代阴谋论，评估LLM分类性能及作为自动标注器的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超党派叙事和人口替代阴谋论（PRCT）对政治极化、制度信任和公共安全构成严重威胁，但现有资源稀缺、英语中心化，且往往孤立分析而非作为政治话语的相互关联方面。

Method: 1) 创建PartisanLens多语言数据集（1617个超党派新闻标题，西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语）；2) 评估主流LLM在分类超党派和PRCT叙事上的性能；3) 评估LLM作为自动标注器的可行性；4) 探索LLM通过社会经济和意识形态配置文件模拟人类标注模式。

Result: 建立了超党派和PRCT叙事的稳健基线，结果显示LLM在分类任务上具有潜力但仍有局限，能够部分近似人类标注，并能通过配置文件模拟人类标注模式。

Conclusion: PartisanLens填补了欧洲语境下检测党派和阴谋论叙事的研究空白，为未来研究提供了多语言资源和评估框架，支持更有效的虚假信息检测和干预。

Abstract: Detecting hyperpartisan narratives and Population Replacement Conspiracy Theories (PRCT) is essential to addressing the spread of misinformation. These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives. At last, we provide our resources and evaluation, \textsc{PartisanLens} supports future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文对LLMs和LRMs的安全对齐能力进行了大规模实证研究，评估了6个内在模型特性和3种外部攻击技术的影响，发现推理和自反思机制对安全对齐至关重要，同时揭示了CoT攻击通过响应前缀带来的严重安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估影响LLMs和LRMs安全对齐能力的关键因素，为开发更安全可靠的AI系统提供必要见解。当前需要了解哪些内在模型特性和外部攻击技术对安全对齐影响最大。

Method: 研究方法包括：1）系统调查6个关键内在模型特性和3种外部攻击技术的影响；2）使用32个近期流行的LLMs和LRMs进行大规模评估，涵盖13个模型家族，参数规模从3B到235B；3）利用5个已建立的安全数据集；4）使用56种越狱技术和4种CoT攻击策略探测模型漏洞，共进行460万次API调用。

Result: 主要发现：1）GPT-OSS-20B、Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking和GPT-OSS-120B是最安全的三个模型，表明集成推理和自反思机制对安全对齐有显著优势；2）后训练和知识蒸馏可能导致安全对齐系统性退化；3）通过响应前缀的CoT攻击可将攻击成功率平均提高3.34倍，对Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct从0.6%提升到96.3%；4）角色扮演、提示注入和基于梯度的对抗提示搜索是现代模型中引发未对齐行为的主要方法。

Conclusion: 结论：安全必须作为后训练和知识蒸馏阶段的明确约束或核心优化目标，不能仅仅从属于通用能力追求。文本补全接口和允许用户定义响应前缀的LLM服务存在严重安全风险，需要架构和部署层面的安全保障。推理和自反思机制对构建稳健的安全对齐至关重要。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个双路径框架，通过训练免费的集群路由和基于强化学习的多步路由，动态选择最优的LLM-工具组合，在跨领域复杂推理任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和外部工具多样性的增加，选择最优的模型-工具组合成为一个高维优化挑战。现有方法通常依赖单一模型或固定工具调用逻辑，无法充分利用异构模型-工具对的性能差异。

Method: ATLAS采用双路径方法：1) 训练免费的基于集群的路由，利用经验先验进行领域特定对齐；2) 基于强化学习的多步路由，探索自主轨迹以实现分布外泛化。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，ATLAS超越了GPT-4o等闭源模型，在分布内任务上提升10.1%，在分布外任务上提升13.1%。在视觉推理任务中，通过编排专业的多模态工具也显示出显著增益。

Conclusion: ATLAS框架通过动态工具选择和自适应路由机制，有效解决了LLM-工具组合优化问题，在跨领域复杂推理任务中实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has significantly expanded the capabilities of AI agents. However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches often rely on a single model or fixed tool-calling logic, failing to exploit the performance variations across heterogeneous model-tool pairs. In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks. Furthermore, our framework shows significant gains in visual reasoning by orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能强大，但计算成本高、部署困难，需要探索小型语言模型是否能作为高效替代方案

Method: 在JFLEG和ASSET数据集上测试小型语言模型，包括开箱即用、微调和顺序运行三种方式，使用已建立的评估指标

Result: 小型语言模型能学习某些行为，但性能低于强基线模型和当前大型语言模型，存在保留语义困难和幻觉问题

Conclusion: 尽管小型语言模型有效率优势，但在改写任务上仍无法与当前大型语言模型竞争，需要进一步训练改进以缩小性能差距

Abstract: Large language models have become extremely popular recently due to their ability to achieve strong performance on a variety of tasks, such as text generation and rewriting, but their size and computation cost make them difficult to access, deploy, and secure in many settings. This paper investigates whether small, decoder-only language models can provide an efficient alternative for the tasks of grammar correction and text simplification. The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations. These findings suggest that despite their efficiency advantages, current SLMs are not yet competitive enough with modern LLMs for rewriting, and further advances in training are required for SLMs to close the performance gap between them and today's LLMs.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法存在两个问题：1）不加区分地触发检索，引入噪声；2）依赖单一路径的证据构建，限制了性能提升

Method: 提出DTR框架：1）利用生成不确定性自适应决定何时需要检索；2）引入双路径检索机制，自适应选择外部信息；3）无需训练

Result: 在5个开放域QA基准测试中，DTR在EM和F1指标上持续优于标准RAG和强基线方法，同时减少了不必要的检索

Conclusion: DTR通过自适应检索触发和双路径信息选择机制，有效提升了RAG系统的性能，减少了噪声引入

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, but existing approaches indiscriminately trigger retrieval and rely on single-path evidence construction, often introducing noise and limiting performance gains. In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型在多项选择题问答中的内部机制，发现模型采用两阶段处理：先选择正确答案内容，再将其绑定到输出符号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题问答容易评估，但引入了元任务：模型既要解决问题，又要输出代表答案的符号，这混淆了推理错误和符号绑定失败。需要理解语言模型如何在内部实现MCQA。

Method: 使用表征分析（PCA、线性探针）和因果干预研究语言模型的内部机制。通过选项边界（换行）残差状态分析，并进行符号和内容排列测试。

Result: 发现选项边界残差状态包含与每个选项正确性相关的强线性可解码信号。胜者身份探测显示两阶段进展：获胜内容位置在最终选项处理后立即可解码，而输出符号在答案发射位置附近表示。

Conclusion: 模型采用两阶段机制：首先在内容空间中选择胜者，然后将该胜者绑定或路由到适当的符号进行输出。这解释了MCQA中推理和符号绑定的分离过程。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is easy to evaluate but adds a meta-task: models must both solve the problem and output the symbol that *represents* the answer, conflating reasoning errors with symbol-binding failures. We study how language models implement MCQA internally using representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) as well as causal interventions. We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.

Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在文档问答中面临动态用户定义的信息披露策略约束，而当前安全研究主要关注隐式社会规范或纯文本场景，忽视了多模态文档的复杂性

Method: 1) 构建Doc-PP基准测试，基于真实报告要求跨异质视觉和文本元素进行推理；2) 提出DVA框架，采用分解-验证-聚合的结构化推理方法，将推理过程与策略验证解耦

Result: 发现系统性推理诱导安全漏洞：模型在需要复杂合成或跨模态聚合推理时频繁泄露敏感信息；提供提取文本虽改善感知但无意中助长泄露；DVA框架显著优于标准提示防御方法

Conclusion: DVA框架为策略合规的文档理解提供了鲁棒基线，有效解决了多模态文档问答中的策略保持问题

Abstract: The deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for real-world document question answering is often constrained by dynamic, user-defined policies that dictate information disclosure based on context. While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding

Motivation: 现有ABSA模型通常只支持三种情感类别，且缺乏对商业实际需求的适应能力。需要开发更强大、多语言、多功能的模型来处理真实商业场景中的复杂情感分析任务。

Method: 1. 使用大规模公共数据和合成数据训练，数据集比SemEval14大20倍；2. 将情感类别从3类扩展到5类（增加混合和未知类别）；3. 联合预测整体文本情感；4. 通过CoT示例进行推理注入微调；5. 为编码器模型引入新颖的推理预训练技术；6. 开发395M参数编码器和8B参数解码器模型。

Result: 1. 在SemEval14基准上创下新的SOTA结果；2. 比GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet准确率高10个百分点；3. 单多语言模型在六种语言上保持87-91%准确率，且不降低英语性能；4. 发布了ABSA-mix基准，聚合了17个公共ABSA数据集覆盖92个领域。

Conclusion: Arctic-ABSA通过大规模数据、扩展的情感类别、推理注入技术和多语言支持，为商业应用提供了强大的ABSA解决方案，显著超越了现有大型语言模型，并提供了标准化的大规模评估基准。

Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.

Motivation: 为了有效对抗LLM生成的虚假信息传播，需要开发更强大的假新闻检测系统。现有方法可能不够鲁棒，需要能够适应不断演化的虚假信息生成技术。

Method: 1. 生成器：通过事实扰动改写真实文章；2. 轻量级检测器：使用密集段落检索验证声明；3. 语言对抗反馈：提供结构化自然语言批评而非标量奖励，指导生成器进行更复杂的规避尝试，促使检测器适应和改进。

Result: 在假新闻检测基准上达到86.98% ROC-AUC，显著优于带检索的通用LLM。消融研究表明：检测器端检索带来最大增益，语言对抗反馈和少样本演示为鲁棒训练提供关键信号。

Conclusion: RADAR通过检索增强和对抗性精炼，为对抗LLM生成的虚假信息提供了有效解决方案。语言对抗反馈机制使生成器和检测器能够共同进化，提高了系统的鲁棒性和检测性能。

Abstract: To efficiently combat the spread of LLM-generated misinformation, we present RADAR, a retrieval-augmented detector with adversarial refinement for robust fake news detection. Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型评估基准的快速增加，迫切需要系统方法来评估基准本身的质量，以确保评估的可靠性和有效性。

Method: 提出Benchmark²框架，包含三个互补指标：1) 跨基准排名一致性，衡量基准产生的模型排名是否与其他基准一致；2) 区分度评分，量化基准区分不同模型的能力；3) 能力对齐偏差，识别同一模型家族中强模型失败而弱模型成功的异常实例。

Result: 在涵盖数学、推理和知识领域的15个基准上对11个LLM进行实验，发现现有基准质量存在显著差异，基于所提指标的选择性基准构建可在大幅减少测试集的情况下达到相当的评估性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark²为系统评估LLM基准质量提供了有效框架，有助于识别高质量基准并优化基准设计，减少评估成本同时保持可靠性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

TL;DR: 提出了VotIE任务用于从市政会议纪要中提取结构化投票事件，建立了首个葡萄牙市政会议纪要基准，发现微调编码器在域内表现最佳，但跨市泛化能力差，而少样本LLM泛化更好但计算成本高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政会议纪要记录了地方民主进程中的关键决策，但与议会记录不同，它们以高度异质化的自由叙述文本编码投票结果，各市政机构格式差异很大，给自动化提取带来了重大挑战。

Method: 提出了VotIE（投票信息提取）任务，旨在从叙述性审议记录中识别结构化投票事件。基于CitiLink语料库建立了首个葡萄牙市政会议纪要基准。实验比较了微调编码器（如XLM-R-CRF）和生成式LLM方法。

Result: 1. 在标准域内评估中，微调编码器（XLM-R-CRF）表现最佳，达到93.2%的宏观F1分数，优于生成式方法。2. 在跨市政评估中，微调模型性能大幅下降，而少样本LLM表现出更强的鲁棒性，性能下降幅度显著较小。

Conclusion: 尽管生成式模型在泛化方面有优势，但其高计算成本限制了实用性。因此，轻量级微调编码器在大规模实际部署中仍是更实用的选择。公开发布了基准、训练模型和评估框架以支持可重复研究。

Abstract: Municipal meeting minutes record key decisions in local democratic processes. Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment. To support reproducible research in administrative NLP, we publicly release our benchmark, trained models, and evaluation framework.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一套评估LLM模拟学生质量的指标，并在真实数学辅导对话数据集上测试了多种模拟方法，发现现有方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在教育领域应用广泛，但评估新技术需要真实学生参与，这既耗时又难以扩展。现有研究多使用简单提示来模拟学生进行训练和评估，但缺乏对模拟学生质量的确保和测量。

Method: 正式定义了学生模拟任务，提出了一套涵盖语言、行为和认知维度的评估指标，并在真实数学辅导对话数据集上对多种学生模拟方法（包括提示策略、监督微调和偏好优化）进行了基准测试。

Result: 自动评估和人工评估均显示：提示策略的模拟学生表现较差；监督微调和偏好优化方法表现更好但仍有限，表明这是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究提升LLM模拟学生质量的方法，当前方法虽有所改进但仍未达到理想水平，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) enable many new innovations in education. However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.

Result: 模型在可靠检测声学不一致性方面表现不佳：有些模型过度预测不一致性，有些则过于宽松；模型难以精确定位有问题的轮次；当提供其他对话者的轮次时，性能显著下降，模型优先考虑文本连贯性而非声学线索，甚至无法检测明显的性别切换。但模型在选择与说话人最匹配的音频变体方面表现更好，显示出固有的声学辨别能力。

Conclusion: 大型音频语言模型存在显著偏差：倾向于优先考虑文本而非声学特征，揭示了需要解决的基本模态不平衡问题，以构建可靠的音频语言评估器。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) as judges have emerged as a prominent approach for evaluating speech generation quality, yet their ability to assess speaker consistency across multi-turn conversations remains unexplored. We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究多语言神经模型中的跨语言知识迁移，重点关注低资源语言的机器翻译，通过分析语言相似性、检索增强、辅助监督等方法提升翻译鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言机器翻译系统旨在实现跨语言知识共享，但低资源语言由于平行数据有限，导致泛化和迁移能力受限。需要深入理解多语言模型如何在不同语言间共享知识，以及表征、数据可用性和训练策略之间的相互作用。

Method: 以机器翻译为主要测试平台，研究跨语言知识迁移：1) 分析语言相似性对迁移的影响；2) 使用检索和辅助监督增强低资源翻译；3) 研究大语言模型在平行数据微调中的权衡；4) 探索训练中语言多样性的作用。

Result: 研究表明：语言相似性影响知识迁移效果；检索和辅助监督能有效提升低资源翻译质量；增加翻译覆盖范围能改善泛化能力并减少离靶行为；大语言模型微调存在意外权衡。

Conclusion: 建模选择和数据构成显著影响多语言学习效果，该研究为构建更具包容性和鲁棒性的多语言NLP系统提供了重要见解，强调需要更细致地考虑语言多样性、数据平衡和迁移机制。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation systems aim to make knowledge accessible across languages, yet learning effective cross-lingual representations remains challenging. These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.

TL;DR: SaLAD是一个多模态安全基准，包含2013个真实世界图像-文本样本，涵盖10个常见类别，用于评估MLLMs在日常生活中的安全影响，发现当前模型在危险行为识别上存在严重漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型成为人类生活中不可或缺的助手，其生成的不安全内容对人类行为构成威胁，需要评估MLLMs在日常生活中的安全影响。

Method: 提出SaLAD多模态安全基准，包含2013个真实世界图像-文本样本，覆盖10个常见类别，采用平衡设计包含不安全场景和过度敏感案例。提出基于安全警告的评估框架，鼓励模型提供清晰的信息性安全警告而非通用拒绝。

Result: 在18个MLLMs上的测试结果显示，表现最佳的模型在不安全查询上的安全响应率仅为57.2%。流行的安全对齐方法在当前场景下效果有限，揭示了当前MLLMs在识别日常危险行为方面的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在识别日常生活中的危险行为方面存在显著漏洞，需要改进安全评估方法和模型对齐技术。SaLAD基准为评估多模态模型安全性提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/xinyuelou/SaLAD.

*Prith Sharma,Austin Z. Henley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPO提出了一种模块化提示优化框架，将提示视为结构化对象，通过局部文本梯度独立优化各个语义模块，在保持整体结构固定的同时提升小规模开源语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法通常将提示视为整体文本块，难以定位错误、保留关键指令或控制提示膨胀。对于依赖显式结构的小型开源指令调优模型，需要更精细的优化方法。

Method: MPO将提示分解为固定语义模块（系统角色、上下文、任务描述、约束、输出格式），应用局部文本梯度独立优化每个模块，通过去重整合更新以减少冗余和组件间干扰。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和MMLU推理基准测试中，使用LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct和Mistral-7B-Instruct模型，MPO始终优于未调优的结构化提示和TextGrad基线，实现显著准确率提升。

Conclusion: 保持固定提示模式同时应用局部模块化优化是提升小型开源语言模型推理性能的有效实用方法，提供可解释且鲁棒的优化过程。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoM-DAD提出了一种分层双过程概率框架，将多模态生成解耦为高层语义规划和低层token合成，通过连续潜在扩散和离散吸收扩散实现统一的文本-图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成建模存在分裂：自回归方法用于离散数据（文本），扩散方法用于连续数据（图像），这阻碍了真正统一的多模态系统发展。掩码语言模型虽然提供高效双向上下文，但缺乏自回归模型的生成保真度和扩散模型的语义连续性，且扩展到多模态设置时面临严重的对齐挑战和训练不稳定性。

Method: CoM-DAD采用分层双过程框架：1）通过连续潜在扩散过程建模语义流形；2）将token生成视为离散吸收扩散过程，受可变速率噪声调度调节，并以演化的语义先验为条件。引入随机混合模态传输策略，无需重型对比双编码器即可对齐不同模态。

Result: 该方法在标准掩码建模上表现出优越的稳定性，为可扩展的统一文本-图像生成建立了新范式。

Conclusion: CoM-DAD通过解耦语义规划和token合成，解决了多模态生成中的对齐和稳定性问题，为统一的文本-图像生成提供了新的概率框架。

Abstract: The bifurcation of generative modeling into autoregressive approaches for discrete data (text) and diffusion approaches for continuous data (images) hinders the development of truly unified multimodal systems. While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \textbf{CoM-DAD} (\textbf{Co}upled \textbf{M}anifold \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}bsorbing \textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型中由提示引起的幻觉问题，特别是在推理过程中缺乏外部结构化知识支持导致的错误预测。

Method: 扩展链式知识蒸馏方法，引入可编程模块作为可执行代码嵌入推理提示中，引导知识图谱探索，并开发增强的蒸馏推理框架来显式调控中间推理步骤。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，使用GPT-4和LLaMA-3.3评估，代码引导推理显著改善上下文建模并减少提示诱导幻觉，HIT@1、HIT@3、HIT@5分别提升15.64%、13.38%、13.28%，多个评估设置中得分超过95%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效约束错误推理，同时提高准确性和可解释性，为减少大语言模型幻觉提供了有效的结构化知识整合方案。

Abstract: To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们越来越意识到LLM在开放和知识密集型任务中的不可靠性，因此转向搜索增强型LLM来缓解这一问题。然而，当搜索引擎被触发执行有害任务时，LLM无法控制返回的内容。一旦返回的内容直接包含有针对性的、可直接使用的有害信息，LLM的安全防护机制无法撤回这种暴露。

Method: SearchAttack将有害语义外包给网络搜索，仅保留查询骨架和碎片化线索，然后通过结构化规则引导LLM重构检索到的内容，以实现恶意目标。这种方法将网络搜索识别为关键攻击面。

Result: 大量实验表明，SearchAttack在攻击搜索增强型LLM系统方面表现出强大的有效性，可用于负责任的漏洞评估。

Conclusion: SearchAttack成功揭示了搜索增强型LLM的安全漏洞，网络搜索成为关键攻击面，需要加强对此类系统的安全防护。

Abstract: Recently, people have suffered and become increasingly aware of the unreliability gap in LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks, and thus turn to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.

*Maryam Rahimi,Mahdi Nouri,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于归因的框架来分析短上下文语言建模中的位置效应，发现位置重要性分布具有架构特异性、输入稳定性和词汇扰动不变性，并揭示了深度增加时的近因偏好和浅层的词类区分特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型往往倾向于使用输入中特定位置的信息，而不考虑语义相关性。虽然位置偏见已在多种情境中被研究，但先前工作未能揭示这些偏见如何在各个层和输入位置间演变，或如何独立于任务复杂度而变化。

Method: 引入基于归因的框架，采用层传导度和滑动窗口方法，量化每个层在输入位置间的重要性分布，生成层级位置重要性剖面。

Result: 位置重要性剖面具有架构特异性、输入稳定性和词汇扰动不变性；发现随着深度增加而增强的显著近因偏好，以及随模型深度减弱的微弱首因偏好；早期层在所有位置上优先加权内容词而非功能词，而后期层则失去这种词类区分。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言模型中系统性的位置处理模式，这些模式独立于语义内容而存在，为理解模型内部表示和处理机制提供了新视角，对模型设计和评估具有重要启示。

Abstract: Language models often show a preference for using information from specific positions in the input regardless of semantic relevance. While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当外部检索证据与LLM内部记忆知识冲突时，模型倾向于依赖记忆事实而非上下文，导致输出不忠实。需要一种高效方法解决此问题

Method: 提出ContextFocus激活引导方法，通过调整模型激活来增强对上下文的关注，无需模型微调，推理开销最小

Result: 在ConFiQA基准测试中显著提升上下文忠实度，优于ContextDPO、COIECD等基线方法，且与提示策略互补，在大模型上同样有效

Conclusion: ContextFocus在提高LLM输出上下文忠实度方面具有高效性、鲁棒性和实用性，是解决知识冲突问题的有效方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

Abstract: We present LLMberjack, a platform for creating multi-party conversations starting from existing debates, originally structured as reply trees. The system offers an interactive interface that visualizes discussion trees and enables users to construct coherent linearized dialogue sequences while preserving participant identity and discourse relations. It integrates optional large language model (LLM) assistance to support automatic editing of the messages and speakers' descriptions. We demonstrate the platform's utility by showing how tree visualization facilitates the creation of coherent, meaningful conversation threads and how LLM support enhances output quality while reducing human effort. The tool is open-source and designed to promote transparent and reproducible workflows to create multi-party conversations, addressing a lack of resources of this type.

TL;DR: FLEx是一种通过少量解释示例改进语言模型行为的方法，通过聚类选择代表性错误，验证解释有效性，并总结为提示前缀，在推理时引导模型避免类似错误，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽然在各种任务上表现良好，但仍然会犯错，且错误会在相关查询中重复出现。自然语言解释可以帮助纠正这些错误，但在需要专家标注的领域，大规模收集解释可能不可行。

Method: FLEx方法包括：1）使用基于嵌入的聚类选择代表性模型错误；2）验证相关解释能否纠正这些错误；3）将解释总结为提示前缀，在推理时预置到输入前，引导模型避免类似错误而不修改模型权重。

Result: 在CounterBench、GSM8K和ReasonIF三个数据集上的评估显示，FLEx始终优于思维链提示，最多减少了CoT剩余错误的83%。

Conclusion: FLEx通过少量解释示例有效改进语言模型行为，无需大规模标注或模型权重修改，为纠正模型系统性错误提供了一种高效方法。

Abstract: Language models have become effective at a wide range of tasks, from math problem solving to open-domain question answering. However, they still make mistakes, and these mistakes are often repeated across related queries. Natural language explanations can help correct these errors, but collecting them at scale may be infeasible, particularly in domains where expert annotators are required. To address this issue, we introduce FLEx ($\textbf{F}$ew-shot $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{Ex}$planations), a method for improving model behavior using a small number of explanatory examples. FLEx selects representative model errors using embedding-based clustering, verifies that the associated explanations correct those errors, and summarizes them into a prompt prefix that is prepended at inference-time. This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\% of CoT's remaining errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融新闻中的虚假信息检测具有挑战性，因为含义往往来自分散的线索。现有模型在无参考情境下的表现存在不足，需要建立一个更贴近现实的测试基准来评估和改进模型能力。

Method: 创建RFC Bench基准，在段落级别操作，捕捉金融新闻的上下文复杂性。定义两个互补任务：1) 无参考虚假信息检测；2) 使用成对原始-扰动输入进行基于比较的诊断。

Result: 实验显示一致模式：当有比较上下文可用时，模型表现显著更强；而在无参考设置下暴露显著弱点，包括预测不稳定和无效输出增加。这表明当前模型在没有外部基础的情况下难以保持一致的信念状态。

Conclusion: RFC Bench通过突出这一差距，为研究无参考推理和推进更可靠的金融虚假信息检测提供了结构化测试平台，特别是在现实世界环境中。

Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.

Motivation: 为高维流体流动提供可解释的因果分析方法，将压缩后的潜在空间表示与物理空间现象联系起来，理解湍流中的相干结构与流动相互作用。

Method: 结合β-VAE进行数据压缩得到近正交潜在变量，使用SURD方法量化变量间的定向信息流，通过梯度-SHAP场将潜在空间因果关系映射回物理空间，并通过渗流分析提取影响每个潜在变量的相干结构。

Conclusion: X-CAL提供了一种通用方法，可将潜在空间的因果分析转化为物理空间的可解释现象，为高维流动分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: We present X-CAL, a pipeline that combines a $β$-variational autoencoder ($β$-VAE) with the synergistic-unique-redundant decomposition (SURD)~\cite{surd} approach for causality analysis to interpret low-dimensional latent representations of turbulent fluid flows. Combining $β$-VAE compression with SURD and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) yields interpretable latent representations and structure-level attributions in physical space, offering a general methodology for causal analysis of high-dimensional flows. Using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of the flow around a wall-mounted square cylinder at $Re_h=2000$, we (i) learn a compact latent space with near-orthogonal variables, (ii) quantify directed information flows among these variables via the SURD approach, and (iii) map latent-space causality back to physical space through gradient-SHAP fields . By means of percolation analysis of the SHAP fields, we extract the coherent, time-resolved structures that most influence each latent variable. The analysis connects coherent structures with latent variables which are in turn associated with wake-boundary-layer interactions. This method enables translating the insight obtained through causal analysis in the latent space into interpretable phenomena in physical space.

Motivation: 在前期工作基础上，将核方差场s推广为动力学场，建立速度场与间歇性场的耦合框架，旨在从单一随机原理统一理解湍流耗散机制，并捕捉湍流中的各向异性特征。

Method: 提出双场框架：速度场v和间歇性场s耦合演化。有效粘度为ν_eff=ν_0+s，应力张量包含由应变-旋转对易子驱动的非线性闭合。s的演化定义为混合度量梯度流：Wasserstein-2梯度流（形态）与局部L^2梯度流（耦合项q驱动）的组合。耦合项分解为产生项和松弛项，产生项由涡拉伸不变量驱动。

Result: 在恒定应力、高雷诺数和重叠层尺度不变性假设下，混合度量方程的唯一尺度不变解为s(y)∝y，该解恢复了对数速度剖面。该框架统一了壁面解析和壁面模拟的渐近行为。

Conclusion: 提出的双场框架通过混合度量梯度流组织湍流动力学，能够从单一随机原理统一描述湍流耗散机制，并成功恢复对数律，为湍流建模提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: In our previous work~\cite{SanchisAgudoVinuesa2025PRL}, we argued that viscous dissipation in turbulence can be understood as the macroscopic imprint of microscopic path uncertainty, and showed that a kernel variance field $s(y)$ constrained by a balance condition yields both the Kolmogorov scales and the logarithmic law of the wall from a single stochastic principle. In the present work we promote $s$ to a dynamical field $s(\bm{x},t)$ with units of kinematic viscosity and develop a two-field framework in which the velocity $\ve$ and an \emph{intermittency} (or stochastic diffusivity) field $s$ evolve in a coupled way. The effective viscosity is $ν_{\mathrm{eff}}=ν_0+s$, but the stress tensor is generalized to include a non-linear closure driven by the commutator of strain and rotation, $[\bm{S}, \bmΩ]$, capturing emergent anisotropy. The evolution of $s$ is defined as a mixed-metric gradient flow: a Wasserstein-2 gradient flow for morphology, $\Div(s\grad s)$, combined with a local $L^2$ gradient flow driven by an objective coupling term $q$. The coupling is decomposed as $q=q_{\mathrm{prod}}-q_{\mathrm{relax}}$, where production is driven by a vortex-stretching invariant, $\mathcal{I} = \|\bm{S}\boldsymbolω\|^2$. This choice ensures that production vanishes identically in strictly two-dimensional flows. We show that, under standard assumptions of constant stress, high Reynolds number and overlap-layer scale invariance, the only scale-invariant overlap-layer solution of the mixed-metric equation is $s(y)\propto y$, which recovers the logarithmic velocity profile. Thus the same mixed-metric equation organizes both wall-resolved and wall-modeled asymptotics within a single, energetically constrained framework.

Abstract: The propagation of water waves is altered when interacting with curved surfaces. Here, we consider the problem of capillary waves interacting with a 3D meniscus. We show that when capillary waves scatter off an object surrounded by a meniscus, the resulting wavefield can be drastically altered and lensing phenomena is observed.

Abstract: Traditional experimental and numerical approaches for fluid dynamics problems often suffer from high computational cost, mesh sensitivity, and limited capability in capturing complex physical behaviors. Moreover, conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) frequently struggle in chaotic and highly unsteady flow regimes. In this work, we propose \textit{PhysicsFormer}, a fast and efficient transformer-based physics-informed framework that incorporates multi-head encoder-decoder cross-attention. Unlike multilayer perceptron-based PINNs, PhysicsFormer operates on sequential representations constructed from spatio-temporal data, enabling effective learning of long-range temporal dependencies and improved propagation of initial condition information. A data-embedding strategy is employed to convert spatio-temporal points into pseudo-sequences, while a dynamics-weighted loss function replaces the standard PINNs formulation. Owing to its parallel learning structure, PhysicsFormer demonstrates superior computational efficiency compared to existing transformer-based approaches. The framework is validated on Burgers' equation and flow reconstruction governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, achieving mean squared errors on the order of $10^{-6}$. In addition, an inverse problem involving parameter identification in the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is investigated. For clean data, PhysicsFormer achieves zero identification error for both $λ_1$ and $λ_2$; under $1\%$ Gaussian noise, the errors are $0.07\%$ for $λ_1$ and $0\%$ for $λ_2$. These results demonstrate that PhysicsFormer provides a reliable and computationally efficient surrogate modeling framework for time-dependent fluid flow problems.

Abstract: The moka pot provides a familiar example of a thermally driven flow system in which heating, vapor pressure generation, and fluid extraction are strongly coupled. We present a minimal, dimensionless dynamical model describing the evolution of temperature, pressure, and extracted volume during moka pot brewing. The model consists of a small set of coupled ordinary differential equations incorporating constant heating, heat loss, vapor pressure buildup, and pressure-driven flow through the coffee bed. The heating stage of the model is quantitatively compared with published experimental temperature time data, allowing the characteristic thermal timescale to be fixed independently. Using the experimentally constrained temperature evolution as input, the model predicts the pressure rise and identifies the onset of extraction without additional fitting parameters. Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits several qualitatively distinct extraction regimes, including delayed onset of flow, smooth extraction, and rapid extraction driven by nonlinear feedback between temperature and pressure. These regimes are governed by a small number of dimensionless parameters with clear physical interpretation. Rather than providing detailed quantitative predictions for specific devices, the model is intended as a transparent pedagogical framework for illustrating how physicists construct, simplify, and test coupled thermo-fluid models using experimentally accessible data in an everyday physical system in an everyday physical context.

Abstract: Turbulence transition often arises from a subcritical transition between bistable states characterized by invariant sets of deterministic dynamical systems, and such transitions can be triggered by system noise as rare events. In this study, we employ the Onsager-Machlup (OM) formulation of stochastic dynamics to examine the Hamilton equations governing the most probable transition paths (MPPs). We introduce an effective potential function, termed the OM potential, which depends on the noise strength. Focusing on the Dauchot-Manneville model as a minimal system with an edge state, we comprehensively analyze the MPP between laminar and turbulent states for different transition times. We find that the MPPs cross the separatrix at nearly the same point regardless of the transition time, and the obtained OM action values suggest that the transition to turbulence occurs more frequently than the transition to the laminar state. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that the noise-induced transition paths follow the OM potential landscape and its bifurcation diagram, indicating that the qualitative behavior of the MPPs is determined by the OM potential. Our methodology formulated in general dynamical systems provides a theoretical basis for predicting noise-induced transitions among invariant sets of the dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注球形堆积，而对不规则间隙几何结构的准确模型稀缺。理解复杂几何多孔介质中的流体流动对于改进填充床反应器的设计和操作至关重要。

Method: 采用数值模拟方法，研究方形棒堆积床几何结构，通过旋转圆盘状模块生成多种几何构型（雷诺数最高达200）。使用开源求解器OpenFOAM进行模拟，并选取特定案例（如α=30°，Rep=100,200）与粒子图像测速测量结果进行对比验证。

Result: 根据相对旋转角度，几何构型可分为通道状（α≤20°和α=90°）和晶格状，这从根本上改变了摩擦因子。在蠕动流状态下，最大摩擦因子出现在α=25°；而在惯性流状态下，最大摩擦因子出现在α=60°。旋转角度的变化还影响了从粘性流向惯性流的转变。

Conclusion: 模块旋转角度显著影响填充床的流动特性，不同几何构型导致摩擦因子和流动状态转变的差异，这为优化填充床反应器设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Understanding fluid flow through porous media with complex geometries is essential for improving the design and operation of packed-bed reactors. Most existing studies focus on spherical packings, having as a consequence that accurate models for irregular interstitial geometries are scarce. In this study, we numerically investigated the flow through a set of packed-bed geometries consisting of square bars stacked on top of each other and arranged in disk-shaped modules. Rotation of each module allows the generation of a variety of geometrical configurations at Reynolds numbers of up to 200 (based on the bar size). Simulations were carried out using the open-source solver OpenFOAM. Selected cases (e.g., $α= 30^\circ$, $\mathrm{Re}_\mathrm{p} = 100, 200$) were compared against Particle Image Velocimetry measurements. Results reveal that, based on the relative rotation angle, the realized geometries can be classified as channel-like ($α\leq 20^\circ$ and $α= 90^\circ$) and lattice-like, fundamentally altering the friction factor. Furthermore, the maximum friction factor obtained in the creeping regime occurred at $α= 25^\circ$, whereas in the inertial regime, this occurred at $α= 60^\circ$. Varying the rotation angle also affects the transition from the viscous to the inertial regime.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of instabilities along fluid-solid interfaces is critical for the efficacy of focused ultrasound therapy tools (e.g., histotripsy) and microcavitation rheometry techniques. Non-uniform pressure fields generated by either ultrasound or a focused laser can cause non-spherical microcavitation bubbles. Previous perturbation amplitude evolution models in viscoelastic materials either assume pure radial deformation or have inconsistent kinematic fields between the fluid and solid contributions. We derive a kinematically-consistent theoretical model for the evolution of surface perturbations. The model captures the non-linear kinematics of a strain-stiffening viscoelastic material surrounding a non-spherical bubble. The model is validated for (i) small, approximately linear radial oscillations and (ii) large inertial oscillations using laser-induced microcavitation experiments in a soft hydrogel. For the former, the bubble is allowed to reach mechanical equilibrium, and then surface perturbations are excited using ultrasound forcing. For the latter, the microbubble forms small bubble surface perturbations at its maximum radius that grow during collapse. The model's dominant surface perturbation mode scales linearly with equilibrium radius and matches experiments. Similarly, the model's perturbation amplitude evolution sufficiently constrains the rheometry problem and is experimentally validated.

Motivation: 虽然Pivoted Cholesky分解在数值线性代数中的代数性质已有充分研究，但在核方法背景下的几何直觉通常不够清晰。本文旨在阐明该算法在再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）中的几何解释。

Method: 通过理论推导证明枢轴选择步骤在数学上等价于使用核度量的最远点采样（FPS），并且Cholesky因子构建是隐式的Gram-Schmidt正交化过程。提供了简洁的推导和极简的Python实现。

Result: 成功建立了Pivoted Cholesky分解的几何解释，将算法与核方法中的几何概念（如核度量和RKHS正交性）联系起来，弥合了理论与实践的差距。

Conclusion: Pivoted Cholesky分解在核方法中具有清晰的几何意义：枢轴选择对应最远点采样，Cholesky分解对应Gram-Schmidt正交化。这种理解有助于更好地应用该算法于大规模核矩阵近似问题。

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: R²VPO：一种基于策略比率方差约束的新型强化学习框架，通过软约束替代硬裁剪，提升LLM对齐的稳定性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于PPO和GRPO的LLM微调方法使用策略比率硬裁剪，虽然稳定但存在两个问题：1）会截断高回报但高差异动作的梯度，抑制复杂推理中的"顿悟时刻"；2）数据一旦过时就无法使用，导致样本效率低下。

Method: 提出R²VPO（Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization），重新审视策略优化中的信任区域目标，通过显式约束策略比率的方差（二阶中心矩）来提供硬裁剪的原则性平滑松弛。采用原始-对偶框架，支持稳定的在线学习，并通过动态重新加权过时样本实现原则性的离线数据重用。

Conclusion: 策略比率方差控制是改进RL-based LLM对齐稳定性和数据效率的有前景方向，R²VPO框架在保持训练稳定的同时，显著提升了性能和数据效率。

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces facilitate direct communication with a computer, enabling promising applications in human-computer interactions. However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 研究强调了将严重程度排序、数据不平衡考虑和季节性风险整合到野火预测系统中的重要性。未来工作将专注于将季节动态和不确定性信息纳入训练，进一步提高极端事件预测的可靠性

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.

### [198] [LUT-KAN: Segment-wise LUT Quantization for Fast KAN Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03332)
*Oleksandr Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUT-KAN：一种基于查找表的KAN网络编译与量化方法，通过将边缘函数转换为分段查找表，显著提升CPU推理速度（10-12倍），同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络使用可学习的单变量函数（通常用B样条实现）替代标量权重，虽然准确且可解释，但在CPU上进行推理时计算成本高（需要大量样条计算），且标准量化工具链难以应用（主要计算不是矩阵乘法而是重复的样条基函数计算）。

Method: 提出LUT-KAN方法：将每个边缘函数转换为分段查找表（LUT），采用仿射int8/uint8量化和线性插值。建立明确可复现的推理契约，包括边界约定和越界策略。提出"诚实基线"评估方法，在相同后端优化下比较B样条和LUT评估。

Result: 在DoS攻击检测（CICIDS2017）案例中，编译后的模型保持分类质量（F1下降低于0.0002），CPU推理延迟在NumPy后端降低12倍，在Numba后端降低10倍。内存开销在L=64时约为10倍。

Conclusion: LUT-KAN为KAN网络提供了一种有效的编译和量化方案，显著提升CPU推理速度，同时保持模型精度，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出一个物理信息框架，用约束高斯过程回归替代KCC模型的经验失效面，直接从实验数据学习，提高混凝土本构模型的泛化能力和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混凝土本构模型（如KCC模型）依赖经验标定的失效面，模型形式缺乏灵活性且无法量化不确定性，需要开发更灵活、物理一致且能处理不确定性的替代方法。

Method: 保留KCC模型的模块化弹塑性结构，用约束高斯过程回归替代经验失效面。使用三轴压缩实验数据训练，通过导数约束确保物理一致性，评估在未训练围压下的泛化能力。

Result: 无约束GPR在训练条件附近插值良好，但外推时性能下降且违反物理约束；物理信息GPR结合导数约束后显著提高精度和可靠性，即使在训练范围外的高围压下也表现良好，同时减少预测方差。

Conclusion: 提出的物理信息框架提供了鲁棒、不确定性感知的替代模型，在保持KCC模型可解释性和数值效率的同时，改善了泛化能力并简化了标定过程，为改进混凝土本构模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \& Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

Motivation: 合成数据训练LLM导致"模型崩溃"问题日益明显，但缺乏在高维空间中量化预测崩溃的严格方法。

Method: 提出SIGMA框架，通过推导和应用Gram矩阵谱的确定性和随机边界，跟踪表示空间的收缩情况。

Result: SIGMA能有效捕捉向退化状态的转变，为大规模基础模型提供可扩展的崩溃监测工具。

Conclusion: SIGMA为模型崩溃机制提供理论洞察，并为递归训练管道的健康监测提供实用可扩展的工具。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

TL;DR: PanSubNet：基于H&E染色全切片图像的深度学习框架，可预测胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）的分子亚型，无需RNA测序，具有临床实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDAC的基底样和经典亚型分型具有预后和预测价值，但RNA测序成本高、耗时长、组织需求大，限制了临床实际应用。需要一种更快速、经济的方法从常规病理切片中预测分子亚型。

Method: 开发了可解释的深度学习框架PanSubNet，使用1,055名患者的配对H&E染色全切片图像和RNA-seq数据。采用双尺度架构融合细胞级形态和组织级结构，利用注意力机制进行多尺度表征学习和透明特征归因。使用Moffitt 50基因特征结合GATA6表达作为金标准标签。

Result: 内部验证（五折交叉验证）平均AUC 88.5%，外部验证（TCGA队列）AUC 84.0%，无需微调。模型预测与转录组程序、分化标志物和DNA损伤修复特征一致。在转移性疾病中增强了预后分层能力。

Conclusion: PanSubNet能够从常规H&E染色切片中快速、经济地进行分子分层，为PDAC提供临床可部署、可解释的遗传亚型分析工具，推进胰腺癌精准肿瘤学。

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

Conclusion: 基于图像的强化学习方法为多智能体分散控制提供了有效解决方案，能够处理结构化视觉输入并实现高效收敛，在复杂场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.

Motivation: 当前LLM安全评估存在局限性：现有自动化攻击方法依赖手工先验或需要白盒梯度访问，导致对模型鲁棒性的高估。需要一种无需梯度或先验的攻击方法来更准确评估模型安全性。

Method: 提出RAILS框架：1) 仅使用模型logits进行随机迭代局部搜索；2) 引入自回归损失函数强制精确前缀匹配；3) 使用基于历史的选择策略弥合代理优化目标与真实攻击成功率之间的差距；4) 支持跨分词器集成攻击。

Result: RAILS在多个开源模型上达到接近100%的攻击成功率，对GPT和Gemini等闭源系统具有高黑盒攻击可迁移性，并能发现跨不同词汇表的共享对抗模式。

Conclusion: RAILS证明了无需梯度或先验知识也能实现有效的对抗攻击，通过跨分词器集成攻击显著提升了攻击可迁移性，为LLM安全评估提供了更准确的基准。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基准测试只能告诉我们模型做什么，但不能揭示其内部工作机制。需要开发无需训练的机制探针来理解模型如何处理信息。

Method: 使用注意力图谱分析方法，将每个层视为令牌图，计算代数连通性(λ₂)、平滑度和谱熵等指标，形成"谱指纹"来检测模型内部机制。

Result: 发现被动触发连通性崩溃(PTCC)现象，在特定课程转换时出现英语语法触发的连通性故障；识别出四种重复处理策略；PTCC定位到第2层稀疏的"补偿补丁"头；拓扑机制主要受令牌化密度而非语言身份影响。

Conclusion: 注意力图谱为模型审计和训练机制验证提供了实用工具，揭示了课程转换对模型内部机制的脆弱影响，以及模型在形式路由与风格灵活性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

Motivation: 质疑MoE模型通过稀疏路由实现领域专业化的普遍假设，探索专家路由行为的真实模式。

Method: 提出COMMITTEEAUDIT后验分析框架，在专家组层面而非单个专家层面分析路由行为，在三个代表性模型和MMLU基准上进行实验。

Result: 发现存在领域不变的"常设委员会"现象：少数专家组成的紧凑联盟在不同领域、层和路由预算中持续占据大部分路由权重；常设委员会锚定推理结构和语法，而外围专家处理领域特定知识。

Conclusion: MoE模型的领域专业化远不如普遍认为的那样普遍，存在强烈的中心化计算结构偏置；当前的负载均衡损失等训练目标可能违背模型的自然优化路径，限制了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

Motivation: 现有新闻视频理解基准主要关注单源、视频内推理，而现实新闻消费本质上是多源的——同一事件由不同媒体以互补细节、不同叙事选择和有时相互矛盾的说法报道。鲁棒的新闻理解需要模型能够比较不同来源的观点、对齐跨来源的多模态证据并综合多源信息。

Conclusion: VNU-Bench填补了多源跨视频新闻理解基准的空白，揭示了现有模型在处理真实世界多源新闻消费场景时的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Motivation: 用户自定义文本分类（UDTC）在实际应用中经常出现，如企业分析、内容审核和领域特定信息检索，但现有方法难以处理用户指定的、先前未见过的类别。

Method: 提出软上下文编码器架构，将每个候选标签与标签集和输入查询的静态软提示表示进行上下文化，在多样化多源数据集上训练以实现零样本泛化。

Result: 在分布内测试数据和多个未见UDTC基准测试中均达到最先进性能，一致优于或匹配基线方法。

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

TL;DR: 提出基于EM的统一框架，利用因果DAG结构在源域和目标域间传递信息，通过一阶梯度EM更新实现缺失目标变量的填补


<details>

Motivation: 解决在部署域中目标变量系统性缺失的问题，当源域有完整观测且已知高斯因果DAG时，需要利用DAG结构将信息从观测变量传递到缺失目标

Method: 提出统一的EM框架，结合源域和目标域数据，利用DAG结构；引入一阶梯度EM更新替代昂贵的广义最小二乘M步；利用已知因果DAG冻结源域不变机制，仅重新估计受偏移影响的分布

Result: 在标准假设下，一阶EM算子对真实目标参数具有局部收缩性，实现几何收敛；在合成七节点SEM、64节点MAGIC-IRRI遗传网络和Sachs蛋白信号数据上，DAG感知的一阶EM算法在目标填补准确性上优于基线方法

Conclusion: 提出的DAG感知一阶EM算法能有效处理协变量偏移和局部机制偏移，在显著域偏移下获得最大改进，为高斯因果DAG下的目标变量填补提供了可扩展解决方案

Abstract: We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability. Code will be released.

TL;DR: VeRPO提出了一种基于可验证执行反馈的密集奖励强化学习框架，通过动态估计单元测试难度权重构建密集奖励，显著提升代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成强化学习中，主流通过/失败结果奖励（基于单元测试执行）存在稀疏性问题，限制了性能提升。虽然最近有研究探索使用外部奖励模型生成更丰富的连续奖励，但这些学习到的奖励模型存在奖励不对齐和计算成本过高的问题。

Method: VeRPO的核心思想是从加权部分成功构建密集奖励：在训练过程中基于执行统计动态估计每个单元测试的难度权重，通过已通过单元测试的权重总和推导出密集奖励。为了确保部分成功与端到端功能正确性的一致性，VeRPO进一步将密集信号与全局执行结果整合，建立仅依赖可验证执行反馈的鲁棒密集奖励范式。

Result: 在多样化基准和设置下的广泛实验表明，VeRPO始终优于结果驱动和基于奖励模型的基线方法，在pass@1指标上实现了高达+8.83%的提升，时间成本可忽略不计（<0.02%），且GPU内存开销为零。

Conclusion: VeRPO为代码生成强化学习提供了一种新颖的密集奖励框架，完全基于可验证执行反馈，解决了现有方法的稀疏性、不对齐和高成本问题，在保持高效的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

Result: stLID在失效检测精度和预警时间方面持续优于现有方法

Conclusion: 提出的stLID方法通过联合考虑时空信息，显著提升了滑坡灾害的早期检测能力，为地质灾害缓解提供了更有效的工具

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

Conclusion: 本地梯度动态是稳定异构联邦学习的关键调节杠杆，ECGR方法通过智能平衡梯度分量有效解决统计异构性带来的稳定性挑战

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

Conclusion: ALERT通过放大内部特征差异，实现了高效有效的零样本越狱检测，能更好地应对现实世界中不断演化的新型攻击

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: This monograph introduces a novel approach to polyphonic music generation by addressing the "Missing Middle" problem through structural inductive bias. Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用模拟器和有限真实数据校准网络路径成本估计，提供理论保证和实用工具，为数据稀缺情况下的路由决策提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Digital twins and other simulators are increasingly used to support routing decisions in large-scale networks. However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Motivation: 传统人工神经网络算子主要用于逼近确定性输入输出函数，但在随机动态系统中的应用相对较少。需要开发能够继承底层过程概率结构的随机神经网络算子来建模和逼近随机信号。

Conclusion: 提出的基于随机神经元的Kantorovich型随机神经网络算子能够有效逼近随机过程，继承了底层过程的概率结构，在随机信号建模和逼近方面具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

TL;DR: ReLA：基于结构化表示学习与聚合的强化学习调度器，通过多尺度架构学习作业和机器的多样化表示，在多种规模实例上实现最佳完工时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实制造系统中的作业调度需要将有序作业操作分配给机器，现有解决方案在运行时间或调度质量方面存在不足，特别是在问题规模增大时表现受限

Method: 提出ReLA强化学习调度器，采用结构化表示学习与聚合方法：1）使用自注意力和卷积的两个实体内学习模块学习作业操作和机器的多样化表示；2）使用交叉注意力的实体间学习模块；3）在多尺度架构中应用这些模块并聚合输出以支持强化学习决策

Result: 在小、中、大规模作业实例实验中，ReLA在大多数测试设置中实现最佳完工时间：在非大型实例上将SOTA基线的优化差距降低13.0%，在大规模实例上降低78.6%，平均优化差距分别降至7.3%和2.1%

Conclusion: ReLA学习的表示和聚合为强化学习调度提供了强大的决策支持，能够实现快速作业完成和决策制定，适用于实际应用

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该研究提出两种信息论度量来量化神经元对单个概念的显著性和选择性，并在TabPFN表格基础模型中发现存在对高级概念具有中等显著性和选择性的可解释神经元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽然强大但决策过程往往不透明。神经科学和人工智能领域持续关注是否存在类似"祖母细胞"的神经元——即对单个概念具有排他性响应的内在可解释神经元。本研究旨在探索基础模型中是否存在这样的可解释神经元。

Method: 提出两种信息论度量：神经元显著性和神经元选择性，用于量化神经元对单个概念的反应特性。将这些度量应用于TabPFN（一个表格基础模型）的表征，并通过简单的神经元-概念对搜索来寻找最显著和最具选择性的配对。

Result: 分析首次提供了证据，表明在此类模型中，一些神经元对高级概念显示出中等但统计显著的显著性和选择性。这些神经元可以在不需要复杂可解释性技术的情况下被识别。

Conclusion: 可解释神经元可以自然涌现，并且在某些情况下，无需借助更复杂的可解释性技术就能被识别。这为理解基础模型的内部工作机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GESCL是一种基于正则化的持续学习方法，通过稳定性和可塑性正则化项，在不增加网络容量的情况下防止灾难性遗忘，同时利用CNN的过参数化特性进行稀疏化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法要么动态扩展网络规模，要么需要记忆过去任务的数据，导致参数和计算成本较高。需要一种固定容量的CNN持续学习方法，既能避免灾难性遗忘，又能保持网络的可塑性。

Method: 提出GESCL方法，包含两个核心正则化项：1) 稳定性正则化项：防止对过去任务重要的滤波器在学习新任务时发生过大变化；2) 可塑性正则化项：利用CNN的过参数化特性，对网络进行稀疏化，调整不重要的滤波器使其适应未来任务。

Result: 在流行的持续学习视觉基准测试中，GESCL在整体分类准确率和避免灾难性遗忘方面显著优于现有最先进方法，同时使用更少的参数和计算量。

Conclusion: GESCL通过结合稳定性和可塑性正则化，在固定容量的CNN中实现了有效的持续学习，既避免了灾难性遗忘，又保持了网络对新任务的学习能力，相比扩展网络或记忆数据的方法更加高效。

Abstract: We present a regularization-based approach for continual learning (CL) of fixed capacity convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially. This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: AMIR-GRPO改进GRPO强化学习方法，通过引入基于组内奖励排名的隐式对比正则化，解决推理任务中的长度偏差和低质量轨迹惩罚不足问题，在数学推理基准上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在复杂推理任务中存在结构限制：序列级优势归一化引入系统长度偏差，低质量轨迹惩罚被稀释，标量目标丢弃了组内奖励排名中的丰富成对偏好信息，导致昂贵的rollout监督未被充分利用。

Method: 提出AMIR-GRPO，通过从组内奖励排名直接构建隐式DPO风格对比正则化来增强GRPO，无需额外标注。该机制增强对低奖励轨迹的抑制，减弱响应级长度偏差，并将每个rollout组转化为更密集的监督约束集。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AMIR-GRPO持续优于强GRPO基线，在正确与错误推理链之间产生更清晰的分离，并在标准GRPO解决的实例子集之外提供更广泛的覆盖增益。

Conclusion: AMIR-GRPO通过利用组内奖励排名中的丰富成对偏好信息，有效解决了GRPO在推理密集型设置中的结构限制，实现了更好的监督利用和性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理局部密度变化的数据集时存在局限：基于距离的方法会遗漏局部异常，而基于密度的方法需要仔细的参数选择且具有二次时间复杂度。作者观察到，全局分析下难以区分的局部异常，在将数据空间分解为受限区域并独立检查每个区域时会变得明显。

Method: 提出SVEAD（随机Voronoi集成异常检测器），构建集成随机Voronoi图，通过归一化的单元相对距离（加权局部尺度）来评分数据点。该方法利用几何洞察，将数据空间分解为受限区域进行独立分析。

Result: 在45个数据集上的实验表明，SVEAD优于12种最先进的异常检测方法。该方法实现了线性时间复杂度和常数空间复杂度。

Conclusion: SVEAD通过随机Voronoi图集成有效解决了局部密度变化的异常检测问题，在性能和计算效率方面都表现出色，为异常检测领域提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

TL;DR: TreeAdv提出树形结构优势重分配方法，通过显式利用群体rollout的树状结构，在数学推理任务上以更少token实现优于GRPO/GSPO的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GRPO将每个rollout轨迹视为独立序列，为所有token分配单一序列级优势，导致样本效率低下和长度偏差（冗长冗余的思维链），无法提升逻辑深度

Method: TreeAdv构建基于熵驱动采样的树结构群体（森林），在高不确定性决策点分支，共享低不确定性token，然后通过重分配完整rollout（所有叶节点）的优势来聚合内部树段token级优势

Result: 在10个数学推理基准测试中，TreeAdv始终优于GRPO和GSPO，在相同监督、数据和解码预算下使用显著更少的生成token

Conclusion: TreeAdv通过显式利用群体rollout的树状结构，解决了标准GRPO的样本效率问题和长度偏差，为基于群体的强化学习提供了更有效的优势分配方法

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于知识蒸馏的回归框架，在训练时使用蛋白质结构数据，推理时仅需序列数据，以提升蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力面临预测准确性与数据可用性之间的权衡。实验解析的蛋白质结构缺乏限制了基于结构的机器学习模型的性能，而这类模型通常优于基于序列的方法。需要克服这一限制，在推理时仅使用序列数据就能达到接近结构模型的性能。

Method: 提出基于知识蒸馏的回归框架：使用结构信息教师网络指导序列基础学生网络的训练，通过结合亲和力标签和中间特征表示进行联合监督。训练时使用结构数据，推理时仅需序列数据。采用Leave-One-Complex-Out交叉验证在非冗余蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力基准数据集上评估。

Result: 序列基线模型：Pearson相关系数0.375，RMSE 2.712 kcal/mol；结构基础模型：Pearson相关系数0.512，RMSE 2.445 kcal/mol；蒸馏基础学生模型：Pearson相关系数0.481，RMSE 2.488 kcal/mol。学生模型显著提升了序列基础性能，误差分析证实了改进的一致性和减少的偏差。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是将结构知识转移到序列基础预测器的有效方法，能够缩小序列基础与结构基础模型之间的性能差距。随着更大数据集的可用，该方法有望进一步改善性能。源代码已公开。

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.

TL;DR: R³L：通过反思重试、关键信用分配和正信号放大，解决强化学习在LLM推理和智能体任务中的探索与利用问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在LLM推理和智能体任务中面临双重挑战：探索方面成功率低且从头开始的重复rollout成本高；利用方面存在粗粒度信用分配和训练不稳定问题，轨迹级奖励会惩罚有效前缀，失败主导的样本会淹没少数正信号

Method: R³L包含三个核心组件：1) 反思重试语言引导探索：通过语言反馈诊断错误，将失败尝试转化为成功轨迹，从失败点重启降低rollout成本；2) 关键信用分配：仅更新存在对比信号的分歧后缀，排除共享前缀；3) 正信号放大：对成功轨迹进行加权，确保正信号指导优化过程

Result: 在智能体和推理任务上，相比基线方法实现了5%到52%的相对改进，同时保持了训练稳定性

Conclusion: R³L通过主动轨迹合成、精确信用分配和正信号放大，有效解决了强化学习在困难任务中的探索与利用问题，为LLM推理和智能体能力发展提供了稳定高效的训练框架

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/R3L.

TL;DR: 本文提出弹性信任区域（ETR）算法，解决GRPO在强化学习可验证奖励中静态信任区域的局限性，通过动态调整优化约束来匹配信号质量，在AIME和MATH基准上表现优于GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GRPO算法在RLVR领域占据主导地位，但其采用统一的静态信任区域约束，假设信号同质性，这与结果驱动学习中优势幅度和方差显著波动的异质性现实不符。静态约束无法充分利用高质量信号，同时不能有效抑制噪声，常导致快速熵崩溃。

Method: 提出弹性信任区域（ETR）机制，通过双级弹性构建信号感知的优化景观：微观层面基于优势幅度缩放裁剪边界以加速高置信度路径学习；宏观层面利用组方差隐式分配更大更新预算给处于最优学习区域的任务。

Result: 在AIME和MATH基准上的大量实验表明，ETR持续优于GRPO，实现更高的准确性，同时有效缓解策略熵退化以确保持续探索。

Conclusion: ETR通过动态信任区域机制解决了GRPO的结构性限制，将优化约束与信号质量对齐，在保持训练稳定性的同时提升了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

TL;DR: EDCO是一个基于推理熵和动态课程编排的LLM微调框架，通过持续调整课程优先级来适应模型训练中的变化需求，相比静态课程方法在多个领域表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM微调中常用的课程学习方法大多是静态的，在训练前就确定了课程顺序，无法适应模型在微调过程中不断变化的需求。需要一种能够动态调整课程、适应模型学习状态的微调框架。

Method: EDCO框架包含三个核心组件：1）高效熵估计器，使用前缀标记近似全序列熵；2）基于熵的课程生成器，选择推理熵最高的数据点；3）LLM训练器，在选定的课程上优化模型。框架持续监控模型状态并动态调整课程优先级。

Result: 在通信、医学和法律领域的实验中，EDCO在监督学习和强化学习设置下，对Qwen3-4B和Llama3.2-3B模型的微调效果优于传统课程策略。高效熵估计将计算时间减少了83.5%，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: EDCO通过动态课程编排和推理熵优先的策略，有效解决了静态课程学习的局限性，在领域特定LLM微调中实现了更好的性能和效率，为LLM自适应微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: GEM-2是一个概率变换器模型，直接学习全球大气动力学和用户决策相关的变量，相比传统NWP模型和现有ML方法，在计算效率和预测性能上都有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气预报用户面临一个困境：许多决策相关的目标（如极值、累积量、阈值超过）是大气状态变量的函数，而非状态变量本身。用户需要通过后处理来估计这些目标，但这种方法可能不够优化并引入结构偏差。核心问题是决策依赖于这些函数分布的预测，而传统模型并未直接学习这些分布。

Method: 引入GEM-2概率变换器，联合学习全球大气动力学和用户直接使用的变量套件。使用CRPS目标训练轻量级模型（约2.75亿参数），相比最先进方法获得20-100倍训练加速。

Result: GEM-2直接超越业务数值天气预报模型，与依赖昂贵多步扩散过程或需要定制多阶段微调策略的ML模型竞争。在决策理论评估下展示最先进的经济价值指标，在S2S和季节时间尺度上稳定收敛到气候学，并对许多通常假设的架构和训练设计选择表现出惊人的不敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过直接学习决策相关变量，GEM-2提供了一种更有效和准确的天气预报方法，解决了传统后处理方法的局限性，同时保持了计算效率和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

TL;DR: 论文提出潜在实例难度（LID）模型，分析最后一层微调中的神经缩放定律，发现pass@k失败率呈幂律衰减，但指数β_eff随训练样本增加而增长，最终饱和于由难度分布尾部决定的内在极限β。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标具有内在、实例异质难度的场景下的神经缩放定律，特别是理解推理过程中pass@k失败率的行为如何与训练过程耦合。

Method: 提出潜在实例难度（LID）模型，其中每个输入的目标方差由潜在"精度"参数控制，该参数服从重尾分布。分析最后一层微调的可解模型，推导出pass@k失败率的幂律衰减行为。

Result: 发现pass@k失败率呈现k^{-β_eff}的幂律衰减，但观测到的指数β_eff是训练依赖的：随样本量N增长，最终饱和于由难度分布尾部决定的内在极限β。学习过程缩小了误差分布的"硬尾"。

Conclusion: LID模型揭示了学习与推理之间的耦合关系：泛化误差的改善使pass@k曲线变陡，直到不可约的目标方差占主导。模型提供了可测试的闭式预测，包括在饱和前优先训练、饱和后增加推理尝试的计算分配规则。

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

Motivation: 表格数据模型在敏感领域广泛应用，需要解释方法满足透明度需求。CFIRE算法虽然有效，但可能为同一样本分配不同类别的规则，引入歧义性。

Method: 提出后剪枝策略，移除低贡献或冲突覆盖的规则，减少模型歧义性，同时保持保真度。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证实，该方法能显著减小模型规模、降低歧义性，同时对预测性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 通过后剪枝策略改进CFIRE算法，能够构建更紧凑、更清晰的代理规则模型，在保持解释质量的同时减少歧义性。

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as community detection in social networks, grouping articles published online and product categorization in e-commerce. Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a reproducible benchmarking framework that systematically compares QML models with architecture-matched classical counterparts across three financial tasks: (i) directional return prediction on U.S. and Turkish equities, (ii) live-trading simulation with Quantum LSTMs versus classical LSTMs on the S\&P 500, and (iii) realized volatility forecasting using Quantum Support Vector Regression. By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \texttt{AAPL} stock and by \textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \textbf{two of four} S\&P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \texttt{S\&P~500} and \texttt{AAPL}. Our benchmarking framework clearly identifies the scenarios where current QML architectures offer tangible improvements and where established classical methods continue to dominate.

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

Conclusion: FALCON通过结合分层token序列生成和知识蒸馏，有效解决了单轮联邦学习在非IID图像数据上的性能问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

Method: 提出谱正则化混合专家(SR-MoE)，采用双重正则化：谱范数约束限制路由函数的Lipschitz连续性，稳定秩惩罚保持专家选择中的高维特征多样性。

Result: 传统线性门控随着深度增加准确率下降达4.72%，而SR-MoE保持结构完整性(平均干扰-0.32%)，促进正向知识转移，实现局部专家更新而不影响全局性能。

Conclusion: SR-MoE为构建高容量、模块化网络提供通用解决方案，能够实现稳定的终身学习。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of neural networks but suffer from expert collapse, where routing converges to a few dominant experts. This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.

TL;DR: 提出ABC-GRPO算法，通过自适应边界裁剪改进GRPO，在数学推理任务上表现更优，保持更高熵值避免早熟收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析发现GRPO的裁剪机制在某些场景下不够理想，通过适当改进可以显著提升其灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出自适应边界裁剪GRPO（ABC-GRPO），这是对原始GRPO框架的非对称自适应改进，采用自适应边界裁剪机制。

Result: ABC-GRPO在基于Qwen3 LLM的数学推理任务上表现优于标准GRPO，训练过程中保持更高的熵值，保留模型探索能力并缓解早熟收敛。

Conclusion: ABC-GRPO通过自适应边界裁剪有效改进了GRPO算法，在保持探索能力的同时获得更好的性能，代码已开源便于复现。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.

TL;DR: 研究几何简单性（作为可解释性）与浅层神经网络准确逼近轴对齐决策树之间的冲突，使用Radon全变差分析决策边界的复杂性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树产生基于规则的轴对齐决策区域（盒子的有限并集），而浅层ReLU网络通常作为分数模型训练。研究几何简单性（可解释性）与准确逼近之间的潜在冲突

Method: 使用Radon全变差（RTV）半范数分析无限宽度、有界范数、单隐藏层ReLU类，研究硬树指示器及其连续替代的RTV性质，构建具有有限RTV的平滑屏障分数

Result: 硬树指示器具有无限RTV；两种自然的分段连续替代（分段线性斜坡平滑和Sigmoid平滑）在d>1时也具有无限RTV；高斯卷积产生有限RTV但具有指数依赖；构建的平滑屏障分数具有有限RTV且能精确恢复盒子决策区域

Conclusion: 几何简单性与准确逼近之间存在冲突，但通过区分分类与分数学习目标，可以构建具有有限RTV的平滑分数函数，在准确性和复杂性之间实现权衡，阈值选择影响训练结果

Abstract: We study when geometric simplicity of decision boundaries, used here as a notion of interpretability, can conflict with accurate approximation of axis-aligned decision trees by shallow neural networks. Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.
  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.
  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $τ=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.

TL;DR: FOREVER是一个基于遗忘曲线启发的持续学习框架，通过模型时间而非训练步数来对齐重放调度，有效缓解大语言模型中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法大多依赖固定的步数启发式策略，但这些策略往往与模型实际学习进度不匹配，因为相同的训练步数可能导致不同程度的参数变化。受人类遗忘曲线启发，研究者希望开发更符合模型内部演化规律的重放调度方法。

Method: FOREVER框架包含三个核心组件：1）基于优化器更新幅度定义"模型时间"；2）遗忘曲线启发的重放调度器决定何时重放；3）强度感知的正则化机制自适应控制如何重放。该方法将遗忘曲线概念与模型内部演化对齐。

Result: 在三个持续学习基准测试和0.6B到13B参数范围的模型上进行了广泛实验，结果表明FOREVER能够持续有效地缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: FOREVER通过将遗忘曲线概念与模型内部演化对齐，提供了一种更符合大语言模型学习特性的持续学习框架，相比传统步数启发式方法能更好地缓解灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存预测模型通常将所有癌症阶段的数据混合训练，可能高估性能并忽视不同阶段的特异性差异。现有机器学习生存分析研究缺乏可解释性和透明度。

Method: 使用SEER数据集，针对结直肠癌、胃癌和肝癌分别构建阶段特异性可解释机器学习模型，应用SHAP和LIME技术进行特征重要性分析。

Result: 识别了人口统计学和临床变量在不同癌症阶段和类型中对生存率的不同影响，揭示了传统黑盒模型中隐藏的特征-癌症阶段相互作用。

Conclusion: 阶段特异性模型提供了对每个癌症阶段最重要因素的新见解，增强了模型透明度和临床相关性，支持个性化治疗规划。

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

Motivation: 当前新闻推荐系统多为黑盒模型，缺乏透明度，难以支持编辑决策制定，需要开发可解释的推荐方法

Method: 使用模糊神经网络从行为数据中学习人类可读规则，通过可配置阈值控制规则复杂度，平衡准确性和可解释性

Result: 在两个公开新闻数据集（MIND和EB-NeRD）上评估，相比多个基线模型能准确预测点击行为，同时学习到可读规则

Conclusion: 该方法能准确预测点击行为并提供可解释规则，揭示新闻消费模式，帮助编辑将内容策划目标与目标受众行为对齐

Abstract: News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了符号回归方法，引入多分类变量和参数共享的中间层次，以减少参数数量并揭示问题更多信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归因其可解释性在科学发现中特别有用。现有方法要么只允许"非共享"参数，要么只包含"共享"参数，且通常只考虑单一分类变量。需要扩展方法以处理多分类变量和更灵活的参数共享机制。

Method: 提出新的符号回归框架：1) 考虑多个分类变量；2) 引入参数共享的中间层次（如跨一个分类共享但在另一个分类中变化）；3) 通过合成数据集测试数据需求减少和迁移学习能力；4) 在天体物理数据集上验证方法。

Result: 1) 在合成示例中，新方法减少了数据需求并展示了迁移学习能力；2) 在天体物理数据集上，与先前只考虑单一分类变量的研究相比，获得了相似的拟合质量但需要显著更少的参数，并提取了更多问题相关信息。

Conclusion: 提出的多分类变量符号回归框架通过引入参数共享的中间层次，能够减少参数数量、降低数据需求，同时揭示问题的更多结构信息，为科学发现提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

Method: 采用自回归扩散框架，将机构表示为序列构建的图（节点对应关节，边对应刚性连杆）。结合因果transformer和去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)，两者都以目标轨迹编码为条件。因果transformer自回归预测离散拓扑，DDPM细化每个节点的空间坐标和边连接

Result: 该方法超越了传统优化方法，实现了可扩展的逆设计，能够推广到任意节点数的机构。成功合成了包含多达20个节点的连杆系统，并可扩展到N节点架构

Conclusion: 该工作推进了自回归图生成方法和计算运动学合成，为复杂机械系统的可扩展逆设计建立了新范式

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Motivation: 在低收入和中等收入国家，自动化血液形态分析对血液学诊断很重要，但面临染色变异、成像差异和罕见形态等数据集偏移问题。由于隐私法规和数据共享限制，建立集中式数据集往往不可行。

Method: 引入联邦学习框架用于白细胞形态分析，使多个临床机构能够在不交换训练数据的情况下进行协作训练。使用多个临床站点的血液涂片，联邦模型学习鲁棒的、领域不变的表示，同时保持完整的数据隐私。

Result: 在卷积和基于Transformer的架构上的评估显示，联邦训练实现了强大的跨站点性能，与集中式训练相比，对未见机构的泛化能力有所提高。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是一种实用且保护隐私的方法，可在资源有限的医疗环境中开发公平、可扩展和可泛化的医学影像AI。

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据变异性和样本量有限的挑战，显著提高了自动睡眠分期模型的可靠性，特别适用于雷达数据有限的情况

Abstract: Objective: Ultra-wideband radar technology offers a promising solution for unobtrusive and cost-effective in-home sleep monitoring. However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.

Conclusion: Dynafit为非线性动力系统分类提供了一种有效的核方法框架，能够学习动态相似性度量，并可通过核函数设计融入先验知识，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

Method: 提出CausalMixFT方法，使用结构因果模型拟合目标数据集，生成结构一致的合成样本，将有限真实数据与因果信息合成样本结合，保持特征依赖关系同时增加训练多样性

Result: 在TabArena的33个分类数据集和2300多次微调实验中，CausalMixFT将中位数归一化ROC-AUC从0.10提升到0.12，优于CTGAN、TabEBM和TableAugment等统计生成方法，并将验证-测试性能相关性差距从0.67缩小到0.30

Conclusion: 将因果结构融入数据增强为低数据环境下微调表格基础模型提供了有效且有原则的途径，能够实现更可靠的基于验证的早期停止，提高微调稳定性

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

Motivation: 医疗机器学习常因缺乏标准化、语义明确的表示而受限，导致数据集和实验间的互操作性和可重复性不足。MEDS标准虽提供事件中心数据模型，但缺乏与语义网生态系统的集成。

Method: 提出MEDS-OWL轻量级OWL本体，提供形式化概念和关系，使MEDS数据集能以RDF图表示；开发meds2rdf Python转换库，将MEDS事件转化为符合本体的RDF图。

Result: MEDS-OWL首个版本包含13个类、10个对象属性、20个数据属性和24个OWL公理。在颅内动脉瘤破裂患者护理路径的合成临床数据集上验证，使用SHACL约束验证结果图。

Conclusion: MEDS-OWL与meds2rdf结合，实现了事件型临床数据向FAIR对齐数据集的转换、溯源感知发布和互操作性，为后续基于图的分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.

TL;DR: 提出Agentic Rubrics方法，通过专家代理与代码库交互创建上下文相关的检查清单，无需执行测试即可评估代码补丁，在SWE-Bench Verified上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件工程代理验证主要依赖代码执行，但环境设置开销大难以扩展；而可扩展的替代方法（如补丁分类器和启发式方法）缺乏代码库上下文且难以解释。

Method: 使用专家代理与代码库交互，创建基于上下文的检查清单（rubric checklist），然后根据该清单对候选补丁进行评分，无需执行测试。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified的并行TTS评估中，Agentic Rubrics在Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B上达到54.2%，在Qwen3-32B上达到40.6%，比最强基线至少提升3.5个百分点。

Conclusion: Agentic Rubrics为软件工程代理提供了高效、可扩展且细粒度的验证信号，其评分与真实测试一致，同时能捕获测试未覆盖的问题。

Abstract: Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于PINNs的深度学习框架能在严重噪声条件下从NLSE中恢复物理参数，仅用500个含20%噪声的稀疏数据点就能以低于0.2%的相对误差重建非线性系数β，超越了传统有限差分方法的性能极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分方法在处理含噪声的稀疏实验数据时，由于数值导数对噪声的放大效应，在逆问题求解中表现不佳。特别是在非线性薛定谔方程等时空动力学系统中，实验数据通常稀缺且噪声严重，需要更鲁棒的参数恢复方法。

Method: 结合物理信息神经网络(PINNs)和自动微分技术，构建深度学习框架。利用物理方程作为正则化约束，从含20%加性高斯噪声的稀疏随机采样数据中恢复非线性系数β。框架包含统计分析和泛化能力验证。

Result: 在β=0.5-2.0范围内，仅用500个噪声数据点就能实现低于0.2%的相对误差。在不同数据量(100-1000点)下保持亚1%精度。统计鲁棒性高(β=1.0时标准差<0.15%)。整个流程在NVIDIA Tesla T4上约80分钟完成。

Conclusion: 物理正则化能有效过滤高测量不确定性，PINNs成为处理稀缺噪声实验数据时空动力学逆问题的可行替代方案。该方法具有广泛适用性，所有代码已开源以确保可复现性。

Abstract: We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.

*Nia Touko,Matthew O A Ellis,Cristiano Capone,Alessio Burrello,Elisa Donati,Luca Manneschi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出轻量级测试时适应框架，使用TCN骨干网络，通过因果自适应批归一化、GMM对齐与经验回放、元学习三种策略，解决表面肌电信号长期解码中的漂移问题，实现低开销的跨会话性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面肌电信号长期解码面临电极移位、肌肉疲劳和姿势变化导致的信号漂移问题。现有方法通常需要大数据集或高计算量，不适用于能效受限的可穿戴设备。

Method: 提出轻量级测试时适应框架，采用TCN骨干网络，包含三种部署就绪策略：1) 因果自适应批归一化用于实时统计对齐；2) GMM对齐与经验回放防止遗忘；3) 元学习用于快速少样本校准。

Result: 在NinaPro DB6多会话数据集上评估，该框架显著缩小了跨会话准确率差距，且开销极小。经验回放更新在有限数据下提供优越稳定性，元学习在1-2样本机制下仅需当前基准数据的一小部分即可达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为长期假肢使用建立了通向鲁棒、"即插即用"肌电控制的路径，实现了低开销的跨会话性能提升。

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.

*Kapil Chawla,Youngjoon Hong,Jae Yong Lee,Sanghyun Lee*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: DG-FEONet：结合间断Galerkin方法和神经网络的数据无关算子学习框架，用于求解具有间断系数和非光滑解的参数化偏微分方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算子学习方法（如DeepONet和Fourier Neural Operator）需要大量配对数据集，且在尖锐特征附近表现不佳。针对具有间断系数和非光滑解的参数化PDE问题，需要开发能够准确捕捉间断特性的数据无关方法。

Method: 结合间断Galerkin（DG）方法和神经网络，使用对称内部惩罚Galerkin（SIPG）方案最小化弱形式的残差。神经网络预测单元级解系数，实现无需预计算输入输出对的数据无关训练。

Result: 在一维和二维PDE问题上验证了模型性能，能够准确恢复间断，在参数空间上具有强泛化能力，并保持可靠的收敛速率。理论分析提供了收敛性保证。

Conclusion: 将局部离散化方案与机器学习相结合，能够在具有挑战性的PDE设置中实现鲁棒、能感知奇点的算子逼近，为解决间断问题提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We introduce Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Operator Network (DG--FEONet), a data-free operator learning framework that combines the strengths of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with neural networks to solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous coefficients and non-smooth solutions. Unlike traditional operator learning models such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator, which require large paired datasets and often struggle near sharp features, our approach minimizes the residual of a DG-based weak formulation using the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme. DG-FEONet predicts element-wise solution coefficients via a neural network, enabling data-free training without the need for precomputed input-output pairs. We provide theoretical justification through convergence analysis and validate the model's performance on a series of one- and two-dimensional PDE problems, demonstrating accurate recovery of discontinuities, strong generalization across parameter space, and reliable convergence rates. Our results highlight the potential of combining local discretization schemes with machine learning to achieve robust, singularity-aware operator approximation in challenging PDE settings.

*Siddhartha E. Guzman,Egor Tiunov,Leandro Aolita*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出一种低秩TT插值框架，能在粗网格TT表示基础上构建细网格TT表示，保持恒定秩并保证误差界，实现指数压缩和对数复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TT分解方法在处理网格结构化数据时存在局限性：精确TT表示仅适用于简单解析函数；全局多项式或傅里叶展开通常导致TT秩随基项数增长；现有方法要么计算昂贵，要么无法恢复底层低秩结构。

Method: 提出低秩TT插值框架：给定描述粗网格离散函数的TT（含n个核心），构建细网格版本的TT表示（含n+m个核心），其中最后m个核心保持恒定秩。该方法保证ℓ²范数误差界独立于总核心数。

Result: 方法实现指数压缩（固定精度下）、对数复杂度（相对于网格点数）。数值实验验证了在1D、2D、3D应用中的性能，包括翼型掩码嵌入、图像超分辨率、合成噪声场（如3D合成湍流），能直接以TT格式生成分形噪声场。

Conclusion: 该工作为可扩展的TT原生求解器（复杂几何和多尺度生成模型）开辟了道路，对科学模拟、成像和实时图形等领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Tensor Train (TT) decompositions provide a powerful framework to compress grid-structured data, such as sampled function values, on regular Cartesian grids. Such high compression, in turn, enables efficient high-dimensional computations. Exact TT representations are only available for simple analytic functions. Furthermore, global polynomial or Fourier expansions typically yield TT-ranks that grow proportionally with the number of basis terms. State-of-the-art methods are often prohibitively expensive or fail to recover the underlying low-rank structure. We propose a low-rank TT interpolation framework that, given a TT describing a discrete (scalar-, vector-, or tensor-valued) function on a coarse regular grid with $n$ cores, constructs a finer-scale version of the same function represented by a TT with $n+m$ cores, where the last $m$ cores maintain constant rank. Our method guarantees a $\ell^{2}$-norm error bound independent of the total number of cores, achieves exponential compression at fixed accuracy, and admits logarithmic complexity with respect of the number of grid points. We validate its performance through numerical experiments, including 1D, 2D, and 3D applications such as: 2D and 3D airfoil mask embeddings, image super-resolution, and synthetic noise fields such as 3D synthetic turbulence. In particular, we generate fractal noise fields directly in TT format with logarithmic complexity and memory. This work opens a path to scalable TT-native solvers with complex geometries and multiscale generative models, with implications from scientific simulation to imaging and real-time graphics.

Conclusion: 提出的方法适用于一般黎曼流形，去除了现有工作中对黎曼Hessian特征值的不必要非退化假设，并指出定位鞍点可能比寻找局部极小值更病态，需要使用非冗余参数化。

Abstract: Finding constrained saddle points on Riemannian manifolds is significant for analyzing energy landscapes arising in physics and chemistry. Existing works have been limited to special manifolds that admit global regular level-set representations, excluding applications such as electronic excited-state calculations. In this paper, we develop a constrained saddle dynamics applicable to smooth functions on general Riemannian manifolds. Our dynamics is formulated compactly over the Grassmann bundle of the tangent bundle. By analyzing the Grassmann bundle geometry, we achieve universality via incorporating the second fundamental form, which captures variations of tangent spaces along the trajectory. We rigorously establish the local linear stability of the dynamics and the local linear convergence of the resulting algorithms. Remarkably, our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for discretized saddle-search algorithms in manifold settings. Moreover, by respecting the intrinsic quotient structure, we remove unnecessary nondegeneracy assumptions on the eigenvalues of the Riemannian Hessian that are present in existing works. We also point out that locating saddle points can be more ill-conditioning than finding local minimizers, and requires using nonredundant parametrizations. Finally, numerical experiments on linear eigenvalue problems and electronic excited-state calculations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the established local theory.

Method: 研究一维空间中的跟踪型泛函和两材料Poisson问题，比较标准方法（使用p次样条基函数）和富集方法（在基函数中考虑界面位置）

Conclusion: PDE约束的离散化对形状和拓扑导数有重要影响，界面处理对导数收敛性至关重要，富集方法在拓扑导数计算中表现更优

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the influence of the discretization of PDE constraints on shape and topological derivatives. To this end, we study a tracking-type functional and a two-material Poisson problem in one spatial dimension. We consider the discretization by a standard method and an enriched method. In the standard method we use splines of degree $p$ such that we can control the smoothness of the basis functions easily, but do not take any interface location into consideration. This includes for p=1 the usual hat basis functions. In the enriched method we additionally capture the interface locations in the ansatz space by enrichment functions. For both discretization methods shape and topological sensitivity analysis is performed. It turns out that the regularity of the shape derivative depends on the regularity of the basis functions. Furthermore, for point-wise convergence of the shape derivative the interface has to be considered in the ansatz space. For the topological derivative we show that only the enriched method converges.

Abstract: In large-scale Bayesian inverse problems, it is often necessary to apply approximate forward models to reduce the cost of forward model evaluations, while controlling approximation quality. In the context of Bayesian inverse problems with linear forward models, Gaussian priors, and Gaussian noise, we use perturbation theory for inverses to bound the error in the approximate posterior mean and posterior covariance resulting from a linear approximate forward model. We then focus on the smoothing problem of inferring the initial condition of linear time-invariant dynamical systems, using finitely many partial state observations. For such problems, and for a specific model order reduction method based on balanced truncation, we show that the impulse response of a certain prior-driven system is closely related to the prior-preconditioned Hessian of the inverse problem. This reveals a novel connection between systems theory and inverse problems. We exploit this connection to prove the first a priori error bounds for system-theoretic model order reduction methods applied to smoothing problems. The bounds control the approximation error of the posterior mean and covariance in terms of the truncated Hankel singular values of the underlying system.

Abstract: We present computational methods for constructing orthogonal/orthonormal polynomials over arbitrary polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$
  using bivariate spline functions. Leveraging a mature MATLAB implementation which generates spline spaces of any degree, any smoothness over any triangulation, we have exact polynomial representation over the polygonal domain of interest. Two algorithms are developed: one constructs orthonormal polynomials of degree $d>0$
  over a polygonal domain, and the other constructs orthonormal polynomials of degree $d+1$ in the orthogonal complement of $\mathbb{P}_d$. Numerical examples for degrees $d=1--5$ illustrate the structure and zero curves of these polynomials, providing evidence against the existence of Gauss quadrature on centrally symmetric domains. In addition, we introduce polynomial reduction strategies based on odd- and even-degree orthogonal polynomials, reducing the integration to the integration of its residual quadratic or linear polynomials. These reductions motivate new quadrature schemes, which we further extend through polynomial interpolation to obtain efficient, high-precision quadrature rules for various polygonal domains.

Abstract: We show that a generalised sparse grid combination technique which combines multi-variate extrapolation of finite difference solutions with the standard combination formula lifts a second order accurate scheme on regular meshes to a fourth order combined sparse grid solution. In the analysis, working in a general dimension, we characterise all terms in a multivariate error expansion of the scheme as solutions of a sequence of semi-discrete problems. This is first carried out formally under suitable assumptions on the truncation error of the scheme, stability and regularity of solutions. We then verify the assumptions on the example of the Poisson problem with smooth data, and illustrate the practical convergence in up to seven dimensions.

Abstract: This paper develops a new algebraic multigrid (AMG) method for sparse least-squares systems of the form $A=G^TG$ motivated by challenging applications in scientific computing where classical AMG methods fail. First we review and relate the use of local spectral problems in distinct fields of literature on AMG, domain decomposition (DD), and multiscale finite elements. We then propose a new approach blending aggregation-based coarsening, overlapping Schwarz smoothers, and locally constructed spectral coarse spaces. By exploiting the factorized structure of $A$, we construct an inexpensive symmetric positive semidefinite splitting that yields local generalized eigenproblems whose solutions define sparse, nonoverlapping coarse basis functions. This enables a fully algebraic and naturally recursive multilevel hierarchy that can either coarsen slowly to achieve AMG-like operator complexities, or coarsen aggressively-with correspondingly larger local spectral problems-to ensure robustness on problems that cannot be solved by existing AMG methods. The method requires no geometric information, avoids global eigenvalue solves, and maintains efficient parallelizable setup through localized operations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed least-squares AMG-DD method achieves convergence rates independent of anisotropy on rotated diffusion problems and remains scalable with problem size, while for small amounts of anisotropy we obtain convergence and operator complexities comparable with classical AMG methods. Most notably, for extremely anisotropic heat conduction operators arising in magnetic confinement fusion, where AMG and smoothed aggregation fail to reduce the residual even marginally, our method provides robust and efficient convergence across many orders of magnitude in anisotropy strength.

Abstract: We derive quantitative volume constraints for sampling measures $μ_t$ on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$ that satisfy Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities of order $t$. Using precise localization estimates for Jacobi polynomials, we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds on the $μ_t$-mass of geodesic balls at the natural scale $t^{-1}$. Whereas constants are typically left implicit in the literature, we place special emphasis on fully explicit constants, and the results are genuinely quantitative. Moreover, these bounds yield quantitative constraints for the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff volume of Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund sampling sets and, in particular, optimal lower bounds for the length of Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund curves.

Abstract: Lower-dimensional subspaces that impact estimates of uncertainty are often described by Linear combinations of input variables, leading to active variables. This paper extends the derivative-based active subspace methods and derivative-based Shapley effects to cope with functions with non-independent variables, and it introduces sensitivity-based active subspaces. While derivative-based subspace methods focus on directions along which the function exhibits significant variation, sensitivity-based subspace methods seek a reduced set of active variables that enables a reduction in the function's variance. We propose both theoretical results using the recent development of gradients of functions with non-independent variables and practical settings by making use of optimal computations of gradients, which admit dimension-free upper-bounds of the biases and the parametric rate of convergence. Simulations show that the relative performance of derivative-based and sensitivity-based active subspaces methods varies across different functions.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a novel and reliable third-order iterative procedure for computing the zeros of solutions to second-order ordinary differential equations. By approximating the solution of the related Riccati differential equation using the trapezoidal rule, this study has derived the proposed third-order method. This work establishes sufficient conditions to ensure the theoretical non-local convergence of the proposed method. This study provides suitable initial guesses for the proposed third-order iterative procedure to compute all zeros in a given interval of the solutions to second-order ordinary differential equations. The orthogonal polynomials like Legendre and Hermite, as well as the special functions like Bessel, Coulomb wave, confluent hypergeometric, and cylinder functions, satisfy the proposed conditions for convergence. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory. This work also presents a comparative analysis with recent studies.

Result: 数值实验对常数、短程和长程介质，以及单模和高斯光束入射情况进行了测试。在所有情况下，计算的散射振幅都显示出谱收敛性。

Conclusion: 该方法为变系数介质中的散射问题提供了一个统一的数值框架，能够有效计算远场数据，且不依赖于显式解或格林函数表示，具有广泛的适用性和高精度。

Abstract: We develop a method to compute scattering amplitudes for the Helmholtz equation in variable, unbounded media with possibly long-range asymptotics. Combining Penrose's conformal compactification and Melrose's geometric scattering theory, we formulate the time-harmonic scattering problem on a compactified manifold with boundary and construct a two-step solver for scattering amplitudes at infinity. The construction is asymptotic: it treats a neighborhood of infinity, and is meant to couple to interior solvers via domain decomposition. The method provides far-field data without relying on explicit solutions or Green's function representation. Scattering in variable media is treated in a unified framework where both the incident and scattered fields solve the same background Helmholtz operator. Numerical experiments for constant, short-range, and long-range media with single-mode and Gaussian beam incidence demonstrate spectral convergence of the computed scattering amplitudes in all cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 围棋长期以来作为人工智能的基准测试，需要复杂的战略推理和长期规划。以往方法如AlphaGo主要依赖基于模型的蒙特卡洛树搜索，本研究旨在探索模型无关强化学习在围棋中的可行性

Method: QZero基于熵正则化Q学习，使用单一Q值网络统一策略评估和改进。通过自博弈和离线经验回放学习，无需搜索过程，从零开始训练，不使用人类数据

Result: 经过5个月训练（仅使用7个GPU），QZero达到了与AlphaGo相当的性能水平，首次证明了模型无关强化学习在围棋中的有效性

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了模型无关强化学习在掌握围棋游戏中的效率，以及离线强化学习在解决大规模复杂环境中的可行性

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Digital Red Queen (DRQ)算法，利用LLM在Core War游戏中通过自我对抗演化程序，模拟生物界的红皇后动态演化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM演化框架多为静态优化问题，忽略了真实世界演化过程中的开放对抗动态（红皇后动态）。研究旨在探索动态对抗目标对LLM演化的影响。

Method: 提出DRQ算法：在Core War（图灵完备虚拟环境）中，LLM演化称为"warriors"的汇编式程序。每轮演化新warrior击败所有先前warrior，形成连续适应序列。

Result: 经过多轮演化，warriors相对于人类warriors变得越来越通用。有趣的是，独立运行中的warriors行为多样性减少，表明向通用行为策略的收敛压力，类似于自然界的趋同演化。

Conclusion: 从静态目标转向动态红皇后目标具有潜在价值。Core War可作为研究对抗适应的可控沙盒，DRQ的简单有效性表明类似自我对抗方法可用于实际多智能体对抗领域（如网络安全、抗药性）。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体工作流，将主任务描述与约束条件解耦，通过量化评分反馈迭代优化提示，显著提升LLM输出对形式约束的遵从性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型常生成内容相关但形式不符合约束的输出，传统提示优化方法只关注主任务描述，忽略了作为接受标准的细粒度约束条件

Method: 设计多智能体工作流，将主任务描述优化与约束条件优化分离，使用量化评分作为反馈，迭代重写和改进提示

Result: 该方法生成的修订提示在Llama 3.1 8B和Mixtral-8x 7B等模型上获得显著更高的遵从性评分

Conclusion: 通过解耦主任务描述与约束条件，并利用量化反馈进行迭代优化，可以有效提升LLM输出对形式约束的遵从性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Motivation: 理解人工智能如何建模内部心理状态对于推进心智理论至关重要。现有证据表明自我认知与他人认知存在统一系统，本文通过让强化学习智能体推断自身内部状态来探索这种自我意识。

Method: 在网格世界环境中，引入受生物疼痛启发的内省探索组件，使用隐马尔可夫模型从在线观察中推断"疼痛信念"，并将该信号整合到主观奖励函数中，研究自我意识对学习能力的影响。

Conclusion: 内省探索框架为研究AI中的自我意识提供了有效的计算模型，展示了自我认知能力对智能体学习性能的积极影响，并为理解人类疼痛感知机制提供了计算视角。

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

TL;DR: CPGPrompt：将临床指南转化为结构化决策树，利用LLM动态导航进行患者评估，在专科转诊决策上表现优异，但在多类路径分配上表现有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践指南（CPGs）为患者护理提供循证建议，但将其整合到人工智能中面临挑战。先前的方法（如基于规则的系统）存在可解释性差、指南依从性不一致和领域适用性窄等限制。

Method: 开发CPGPrompt自动提示系统，将叙述性临床指南转化为结构化决策树，利用大语言模型（LLM）动态导航决策树进行患者病例评估。在三个领域（头痛、腰痛、前列腺癌）生成合成病例，测试不同决策场景。

Result: 二元专科转诊分类在所有领域表现一致强劲（F1：0.85-1.00），召回率高（1.00±0.00）。多类路径分配表现降低，存在领域差异：头痛（F1：0.47）、腰痛（F1：0.72）、前列腺癌（F1：0.77）。性能差异反映了各指南的结构特点。

Conclusion: CPGPrompt能有效将临床指南整合到AI系统中，在二元决策任务上表现优异，但在复杂多类路径分配上仍需改进。不同指南的结构特点影响系统性能，未来需针对特定挑战（如否定处理、时间推理）进行优化。

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

Motivation: 大型基础模型在医疗AI中应用广泛，但能否提供真正个性化治疗仍存疑问。存在多个悖论挑战：泛化悖论（模型在一个研究中准确但在其他研究中表现随机）、隐私-性能悖论、规模-特异性悖论、自动化-同理心悖论。需要明确预测与因果推理的边界。

Method: 提出混合框架：大型基础模型从多模态群体数据中生成干预候选排名和不确定性估计，然后触发后续的N-of-1试验进行因果验证。N-of-1试验作为个体因果推断的金标准，通过交叉自实验提供个体内因果证据并保护隐私。

Result: 论证大型基础模型无法替代N-of-1试验，两者具有互补性。基础模型擅长从群体模式快速生成假设，N-of-1试验擅长个体因果验证。混合框架能解决个性化医疗中的多个悖论。

Conclusion: 大型基础模型和N-of-1试验应结合使用：基础模型生成假设，N-of-1试验验证因果。明确预测与因果的边界、解决悖论对于负责任地将AI整合到个性化医疗中至关重要。混合框架能实现真正的个性化治疗。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Motivation: 在开放式的具身环境中，智能体需要持续获取、细化和复用不断扩展的技能库。现有方法在技能组合、稳定性和网络紧凑性方面存在挑战，需要一种能够动态演化技能网络的新框架。

Conclusion: PSN框架为开放环境中的持续技能学习提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过符号程序表示和LLM驱动的机制，实现了技能网络的动态演化和高效复用，在复杂环境中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

Motivation: 在实际推理任务中，模型参数通常从数据中学习得到，存在不确定性。需要评估推理结果的不确定性程度，但计算WMC方差的可行性尚不清楚。

Method: 1. 为结构化d-DNNF输入设计了多项式时间算法来计算WMC方差；2. 证明了该问题对于结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD是困难的；3. 将方法应用于贝叶斯网络推理的不确定性测量。

Result: 1. 成功为结构化d-DNNF开发了多项式时间方差计算算法；2. 证明了即使对于支持多项式时间WMC的d-DNNF和FBDD，方差计算也是困难的；3. 实验证明算法能在真实贝叶斯网络上评估边际概率的方差。

Conclusion: WMC方差计算在结构化d-DNNF上是可处理的，但在其他知识编译形式下是困难的。该方法能有效评估贝叶斯网络推理中的不确定性，为参数不确定性分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

Motivation: 现有方法难以确定哪种形式的安全推理能有效防御越狱攻击，这很难明确设计或直接获得

Method: 提出STAR-S框架，将安全规则推理学习整合到自学习循环中：通过安全规则引导推理和反思，然后利用微调增强安全推理，重复此过程形成协同循环

Result: 实验表明STAR-S能有效防御越狱攻击，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: STAR-S通过自学习循环增强安全推理能力，为LLM安全部署提供了有效防御越狱攻击的解决方案

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

Motivation: 当前CoT评估方法的局限性模糊了性能提升是来自真正推理还是仅仅来自冗长的输出，需要更全面的评估框架来诊断LLMs的推理能力。

Method: 提出神经符号框架进行非侵入式、过程中心的推理评估，识别四种行为原型，分析推理模式、训练策略和模型规模的影响。

Result: 发现扩展token生成不是深度推理的必要条件；混合长短CoT数据训练会导致过早饱和和崩溃；小模型蒸馏能复制行为长度但无法复制逻辑效能。

Conclusion: 需要更精细的评估方法来理解LLMs的推理能力，训练策略和模型规模对推理效能有重要影响，扩展输出长度不等于改善推理质量。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

Motivation: 训练可靠的工具增强代理面临信用分配的挑战，现有LLM评估器因缺乏细粒度、任务特定的评估标准而产生噪声和不一致的信号。

Method: 引入SCRIBE框架，基于技能原型库进行中间层抽象，将开放式LLM评估转化为约束验证问题，为奖励模型提供精确的结构化评估标准。

Conclusion: SCRIBE通过中间层技能掌握促进高层规划行为的出现，与底层工具优化互补，为构建更自主可靠的工具使用代理提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大推理模型自主选择推理策略常导致低效甚至错误的推理路径，需要开发控制推理策略的方法。现有方法难以控制细粒度推理策略，因为模型隐藏状态中存在概念纠缠问题。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器将策略纠缠的隐藏状态分解为解耦特征空间，提出SAE-Steering两阶段特征识别流程：首先通过放大策略特定关键词的logits召回特征（过滤99%以上特征），然后按控制效果对剩余特征排序。

Result: SAE-Steering在控制效果上比现有方法提升超过15%，通过控制推理策略可将模型从错误路径重定向到正确路径，实现7%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: SAE-Steering方法能有效识别策略特定特征作为控制向量，实现对大推理模型推理策略的精细控制，提高推理可靠性和灵活性，为模型可控推理提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现直接将基于文本的思维链推理范式迁移到蛋白质功能理解是无效的，强化学习主要放大表面关键词模式而未能引入新的生物学知识，导致泛化能力有限。蛋白质功能预测是一个知识密集型的科学任务，根本上依赖于外部生物学先验和计算工具而非纯内部推理。

Method: 提出PFUA（工具增强的蛋白质推理代理），统一问题分解、工具调用和基于证据的答案生成。不依赖长无约束的推理轨迹，而是整合领域特定工具来产生可验证的中间证据。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PFUA始终优于纯文本推理模型，平均性能提升103%。

Conclusion: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合领域特定工具而非纯文本推理，PFUA通过工具增强的方法有效解决了这一问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

*Zoran Milosevic,Fethi Rabhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于企业分布式系统标准、形式化方法和行业实践的LLM与Agentic AI系统架构设计模式，重点关注Agentic Communities（AI代理与人类协调的组织框架），并通过临床试验匹配案例验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和Agentic AI技术的快速发展需要系统性的架构指导来构建复杂的生产级系统。当前缺乏结合实践指导和形式化验证的架构方法，特别是在企业级多代理生态系统中。

Method: 从企业分布式系统标准、形式化方法和行业实践中提取设计模式，将其分为三个层次：LLM代理（任务特定自动化）、Agentic AI（自适应目标寻求者）和Agentic Communities（组织框架）。重点关注Agentic Communities，基于分布式系统的协调原则建立形式化框架，通过角色、协议和治理结构规范AI代理与人类的协作。

Result: 提出了一个既提供实践指导又具备形式化验证能力的框架，能够通过问责机制表达组织、法律和伦理规则，确保代理间通信、协商和意图建模的可操作和可验证治理。通过临床试验匹配案例研究验证了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为从业者提供了可操作的指导，同时保持了企业级动态多代理生态系统部署所需的形式化严谨性，填补了LLM和Agentic AI系统架构设计的空白。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

TL;DR: SafeRemind：一种在大型推理模型思考步骤中动态注入安全提醒短语的解码时防御方法，能显著提升安全性而不影响推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过显式思考步骤取得了显著成功，但这些思考步骤可能放大不安全行为，而传统防御机制忽视了LRM独特的推理动态。研究发现思考步骤中出现安全提醒短语对确保LRM安全起着关键作用。

Method: 提出SafeRemind方法，在解码时动态将安全提醒短语注入思考步骤。利用熵触发器在决策锁定点进行干预，将潜在有害轨迹重定向到更安全的结果，无需参数更新。

Result: 在5个LRM和6个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，SafeRemind显著增强了安全性，实现了高达45.5%的提升，同时保持了核心推理效用。

Conclusion: SafeRemind是一种有效的解码时防御方法，通过动态注入安全提醒短语来增强大型推理模型的安全性，而不损害其推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

### [292] [Sandwich Reasoning: An Answer-Reasoning-Answer Approach for Low-Latency Query Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03672)
*Chen Zhang,Kepu Zhang,Jiatong Zhang,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR) 提出了一种新的推理范式，通过"答案-推理-答案"的三明治结构，在保持CoT推理准确性的同时，将查询纠正的延迟降低40-70%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代搜索管道中的查询纠正需要在实时延迟约束下保持高准确性。虽然Chain-of-Thought推理能提高准确性，但其延迟过高无法满足实时需求。提前输出答案虽然能降低延迟，但答案无法受益于后续推理过程，导致准确性下降。

Method: SandwichR采用"答案-推理-答案"的三明治推理范式：先生成初始纠正，然后进行显式推理过程，最后生成最终精炼纠正。通过一致性感知的强化学习策略，包括专门的一致性奖励来对齐初始和最终纠正，以及基于边界的拒绝采样来优先处理推理能带来最大纠正增益的边界样本。

Result: 实验结果表明，SandwichR在达到与标准CoT相当的最先进准确性的同时，实现了40-70%的延迟降低，解决了在线搜索中的延迟-准确性权衡问题。此外，还构建了专门用于复杂查询纠正的高质量数据集。

Conclusion: SandwichR通过创新的三明治推理架构和一致性对齐机制，成功解决了查询纠正中延迟与准确性的权衡问题，为实时搜索系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

TL;DR: 使用LLM生成领域特定启发式函数，将个性化用药规划从最多7种药物扩展到至少28种，显著提升覆盖率和规划时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于通用领域独立启发式的自动化用药规划方法在实践中最多只能处理7种药物，这在临床应用中远远不够，需要扩展到更实用的规模

Method: 通过程序化方式定义领域（指定初始状态和后继生成过程），使用LLM生成问题特定的启发式函数，配合固定搜索算法（GBFS）进行规划

Result: 在覆盖率和规划时间方面取得显著改进，能够处理至少28种药物的规划问题，使用药规划更接近实际应用

Conclusion: 自动生成的领域特定启发式函数能够有效扩展个性化用药规划的规模，使其更接近临床实际应用需求

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调数据集存在"答案正确但推理错误"的问题，即最终答案正确但中间步骤存在幻觉、冗余或逻辑错误，这影响了思维链监督的质量

Method: 提出EntroCoT统一框架：1）基于熵的机制在不确定节点分割推理轨迹；2）蒙特卡洛rollout机制评估每个步骤的边际贡献；3）准确过滤欺骗性推理样本，构建高质量数据集

Result: 在数学基准测试上的广泛实验表明，使用EntroCoT构建的子集进行微调，始终优于全数据集监督的基线方法

Conclusion: EntroCoT能有效识别和优化低质量思维链监督数据，确保每个中间步骤都有助于最终答案，从而提升大语言模型的数学推理能力

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

*Muyang Zhao,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ROI-Reasoning框架，通过元认知微调和理性感知强化学习，让LLM在严格token预算下智能分配计算资源，解决多任务推理中的计算分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽然具备强大推理能力，但无法自动判断不同任务所需的计算量，在严格全局token约束下需要智能分配计算资源。现有方法缺乏对任务难度预测和投资回报率(ROI)估计的能力，导致计算资源分配效率低下。

Method: 提出两阶段ROI-Reasoning框架：1) 元认知微调阶段：训练模型预测推理成本和预期效用，实现显式的"解决或跳过"决策；2) 理性感知强化学习阶段：在硬token预算下优化序列决策，学习长期分配策略。将问题形式化为有序随机多选择背包问题(OS-MCKP)。

Result: 在预算约束的数学推理基准测试中，ROI-Reasoning在严格计算预算下持续提高总体得分，同时显著减少遗憾值，表现出优越的计算资源分配能力。

Conclusion: ROI-Reasoning赋予LLM内在的预算感知理性能力，通过预测任务难度、估计投资回报率和战略分配计算，有效解决了严格token约束下的多任务推理问题，为资源受限环境下的LLM推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Motivation: 可废止蕴涵涉及从不完整信息中得出合理结论，KLM框架是建模可废止蕴涵的基础框架，理性闭包(RC)是该框架中最突出的算法之一。现有实现多为命令式方法，本文旨在提供一种声明式的ASP方法来自动计算RC。

Method: 使用答案集编程(ASP)为理性闭包(RC)提供声明式定义，能够从给定知识库自动构建最小排序模型，并支持对指定查询进行蕴涵检查。通过形式化证明验证ASP编码的正确性。

Result: 实验评估表明，基于ASP的方法遵循RC的理论基础，并与现有命令式实现(特别是InfOCF求解器)相比，提供了改进的计算效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ASP方法为计算理性闭包提供了一种有效的声明式替代方案，不仅保持了理论正确性，还在计算效率上优于现有命令式实现。

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: ASP方法能有效建模刑法典并支持法律推理，工具提供的自动可解释性有助于澄清司法决策逻辑，使决策过程更加透明可解释

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 现有的可解释AI方法主要关注输入输出关系，忽略了神经网络的结构信息。需要一种能够提供全局解释并考虑网络内部结构的方法。

Method: 提出xDNN(ASP)系统，给定神经网络模型和训练数据，提取基于答案集语义的逻辑程序，使程序的答案集与网络的输入输出对一一对应。

Conclusion: xDNN(ASP)能够生成包含网络结构信息的全局解释，不仅有助于理解模型，还能指导网络优化（如减少隐藏层节点数）。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

Motivation: 随着智能体面临更多需要预测未来状态的任务，生成式世界模型作为外部模拟器提供了一种有前景的解决方案。本研究旨在实证检验当前智能体是否能够有效利用世界模型作为工具来增强其认知能力。

Method: 通过在各种智能体任务和视觉问答任务上进行实验，观察智能体在使用世界模型时的行为模式，包括调用频率、结果使用方式，并进行归因分析来识别瓶颈所在。

Result: 研究发现：1）智能体很少调用模拟（少于1%）；2）经常误用预测结果（约15%）；3）当模拟可用或被强制使用时，性能表现不一致甚至下降（最多5%）。归因分析表明主要瓶颈在于智能体决定何时模拟、如何解释预测结果以及如何将预见整合到下游推理中的能力。

Conclusion: 当前智能体在利用世界模型进行前瞻性认知方面存在显著局限性，需要开发能够促进与世界模型进行校准、战略性交互的机制，以实现未来智能体系统中更可靠的预测性认知。

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

Motivation: 强化学习在数学和编程等可验证奖励领域表现出色，但扩展到金融决策时面临挑战：市场具有随机性，奖励虽然可验证但本质上是噪声的，导致标准RL退化为奖励黑客

Method: 提出Trade-R1训练框架，通过过程级推理验证连接可验证奖励与随机环境。核心创新是将冗长金融文档的推理评估转化为结构化RAG任务，构建三角一致性度量（检索证据、推理链和决策之间的两两对齐），作为噪声市场回报的有效性过滤器。探索两种奖励整合策略：固定效应语义奖励（FSR）和动态效应语义奖励（DSR）

Conclusion: 通过过程级推理验证将可验证奖励与随机环境连接，能够有效解决金融决策中RL的奖励黑客问题，DSR策略在泛化能力和推理一致性方面表现最佳

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Conclusion: DOT方法有效解决了模型在简单输入上的长度偏移问题，在保持复杂问题长程推理能力的同时大幅提升推理效率，为高效推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.
