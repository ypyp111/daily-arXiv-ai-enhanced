Method: 提出MLLM引导的语义对齐模块(MGSA)，通过多模态输入整合和语义对齐损失来捕捉跨模态语义关系；采用两阶段渐进训练策略和自合成流程。

Result: UniFit不仅支持多种虚拟试穿任务（包括多服装和模型间试穿），而且实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniFit通过MLLM驱动的语义对齐和渐进训练策略，成功构建了一个能够灵活处理多样化复杂任务的通用虚拟试穿框架。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3通过渐进式分层蒸馏方法将SAM3的能力转移到轻量级模型上，实现设备端概念分割和跟踪，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3的统一架构（共享视觉骨干网络、DETR风格检测器、密集内存跟踪器）在设备端使用上过于昂贵，需要开发高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用渐进式分层蒸馏(PHD)方法，分三个阶段：编码器蒸馏、时序内存蒸馏和端到端微调，使用RepViT、TinyViT和EfficientViT等轻量级骨干网络。

Result: 在流行的视频目标分割数据集上进行了基准测试，与相关工作比较，实现了强大的性能-效率权衡。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3系列模型能够在保持教师模型行为高保真度的同时，实现设备端概念分割和跟踪，提供了有效的性能-效率平衡方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出四种新颖扩展来改进基于模型的6D物体姿态估计方法，包括动态非均匀密集采样、多假设推理、迭代精炼和遮挡训练增强，显著提升了遮挡场景下的姿态估计精度和推理速度。


<details>

Motivation: 解决在遮挡场景下，传统多阶段姿态估计管道早期阶段容易出错且错误会传播的问题，提高对未见物体的泛化能力。

Method: 采用动态非均匀密集采样聚焦可见区域、多假设推理保留多个姿态候选、迭代精炼逐步提升精度、遮挡训练增强提升鲁棒性，并提出了新的加权可见性评估指标。

Result: 在ICBIN数据集上精度提升超过5%，在BOP数据集上提升超过2%，同时推理速度提升约3倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了遮挡场景下的6D姿态估计问题，显著提升了精度和效率，为机器人、增强现实等应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

### [4] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，用于为同质历史地图语料库生成合成训练数据，以解决历史地图标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图的自动化分析受限于标注训练数据的稀缺性，特别是对于特定同质制图领域的地图语料库。创建高质量训练数据耗时且需要大量人工努力，而现有合成数据往往缺乏真实性和多样性。

Method: 通过将原始历史地图语料库的制图风格转移到矢量数据上，结合自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，模拟历史地图扫描中常见的视觉不确定性和噪声。

Result: 生成的数据集被用于使用自构建图卷积网络进行领域自适应语义分割，全面评估了数据引导方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为同质历史地图语料库引导生成无限数量的合成历史地图，适用于土地覆盖解释等任务，有效解决了训练数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [5] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D是一种针对仓库场景中存储箱的类别级6D姿态估计方法，通过单次RGB-D观测快速推断箱子尺寸并使用类别CAD模板估计姿态，在保持高精度的同时将推理时间减少约76%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有6D姿态估计方法在仓库自动化等工业场景中的局限性：基于模型的方法需要精确CAD模型且适应性差；无模型方法在复杂条件下容易失败；类别级方法过于通用且忽略环境先验。

Method: 使用单次RGB-D观测，通过快速二分搜索推断箱子尺寸，基于类别CAD模板而非实例特定模型估计姿态，采用深度合理性过滤器和早停策略来拒绝不合理假设。

Result: 在真实仓库场景和公共基准测试中，Box6D实现了竞争性或更优的6D姿态精度，同时推理时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: Box6D为仓库环境中的存储箱提供了一种高效准确的6D姿态估计解决方案，平衡了灵活性和精度，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

### [6] [RB-FT: Rationale-Bootstrapped Fine-Tuning for Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15923)
*Meilong Xu,Di Fu,Jiaxing Zhang,Gong Yu,Jiayu Zheng,Xiaoling Hu,Dongdi Zhao,Feiyang Li,Chao Chen,Yong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段自改进范式，通过让视觉语言模型生成详细文本推理来弥合领域特定视频分类中的语义差距，无需新标注即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类任务中表现不佳，特别是在数据有限的情况下，这源于复杂的时空内容与抽象分类标签之间的语义距离难以弥合。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先让VLM为每个视频生成详细文本推理，然后基于这些自生成的推理进行微调；第二阶段进行传统的监督微调。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于直接监督微调，验证了自生成推理作为适应领域特定视频分析的有效且标注高效范式。

Conclusion: 自生成推理是适应视觉语言模型到领域特定视频分析的有效方法，能够在不增加新标注的情况下显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

### [7] [Boosting Medical Visual Understanding From Multi-Granular Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15943)
*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MGLL框架，通过多粒度语言学习改进CLIP在医学影像等多标签、多粒度场景下的对齐能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等现有方法专注于单标签、单粒度对齐，但在医学影像等复杂领域中，图像通常对应多个高层标签和不同粒度的标注，需要更强大的多标签和跨粒度对齐能力

Method: MGLL框架利用结构化多标签监督，整合不同粒度的文本描述，引入带点约束的软标签监督来增强对齐，使用平滑KL散度确保跨粒度一致性，作为即插即用模块保持计算效率

Result: 在构建的大规模多粒度数据集上预训练，并在多个数据集上评估，MGLL在下游任务中优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: MGLL有效解决了医学影像等多标签、多粒度场景下的视觉-语言对齐问题，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出从3D心脏超声体积中自动选择标准2D视图的方法，通过深度学习分类器和解剖标志启发式算法重建标准超声视图，验证准确率达96%，并证明提取的2D视频保留空间校准和诊断特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心脏超声依赖2D视频，而3D超声能提供更好的图像质量和评估离轴特征的能力，但医生习惯使用标准2D视图进行诊断。

Method: 应用深度学习视图分类器和基于解剖标志的下游启发式算法，结合心脏病专家的启发式知识，从3D超声体积重建标准2D超声视图。

Conclusion: 该方法使临床医生能够从3D体积中获得准确的真实世界解释，同时受益于3D扫描的速度和可用性。

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

*Raphael Ruschel,Hardikkumar Prajapati,Awsafur Rahman,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph是首个交互式全景视频场景图生成框架，通过单一用户提示（如点击或边界框）实现跨时间分割跟踪、自主发现交互对象并预测三元组，形成时间一致的场景图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频场景图生成系统是封闭的前馈管道，无法融入人类指导；而可提示分割模型缺乏语义或关系推理能力。需要统一视觉提示与空间、时间和语义理解的交互框架。

Method: 引入动态交互发现模块生成主体条件化对象提示，以及语义分类头执行联合实体和谓词推理。从单一用户提示出发，分割跟踪主体、自主发现交互对象并预测三元组。

Result: 在OpenPVSG基准测试中，Click2Graph为用户引导的全景视频场景图生成建立了坚实基础，展示了人类提示如何与全景定位和关系推理相结合。

Conclusion: Click2Graph实现了可控和可解释的视频场景理解，将人类提示与全景定位和关系推理相结合，填补了现有系统的空白。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP提出了一种基于信息论的CLIP微调方法，用于开放词汇语义分割，通过互信息目标来保持预训练模型的模态对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限类别上微调CLIP进行分割时容易过拟合，并破坏预训练模型的视觉-语言对齐能力。

Method: 使用两个互信息目标：压缩预训练CLIP的像素-文本模态对齐以减少噪声；最大化预训练CLIP与微调模型之间对齐知识的互信息来传递适合分割的局部语义关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛评估验证了InfoCLIP在增强CLIP微调用于开放词汇语义分割方面的有效性。

Conclusion: InfoCLIP展示了在不对称迁移中的适应性和优越性，能够稳定模态对齐并提升分割性能。

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的一致性正则化方法，通过多任务学习改善乳腺超声肿瘤分割的泛化性能，缓解分割和分类任务间的破坏性干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习可能遭受破坏性任务干扰，导致联合训练模型表现不如单任务基线，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 采用基于可微分BI-RADS形态特征的一致性正则化方法，在乳腺超声数据集上进行多任务学习训练。

Result: 在三个外部数据集上验证，分割任务泛化性能显著提升（p<0.001）：UDIAT（0.81 vs 0.59）、BUSI（0.66 vs 0.56）、BUS-UCLM（0.69 vs 0.49）。在UDIAT数据集上达到最先进的分割性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的多任务学习方法能有效缓解任务间干扰，显著提升乳腺超声肿瘤分割的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Motivation: 当前基于全局相似性的方法难以捕捉细粒度类别差异和类别特定属性多样性，特别是在大规模电商场景中

Method: 检测引导的生成式框架，提取精炼的ROI级特征，使用BART生成器以粗到细的方式生成语义token，涵盖类别层次结构和属性-值对

Result: 在大规模电商数据集和开源数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于相似性的流程和多阶段分类系统

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更强的细粒度识别能力和更连贯的统一推理

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Method: 提出公平感知演示选择(FADS)，通过聚类采样构建人口统计学平衡且语义相关的演示，解决传统演示选择策略因人口统计学不平衡导致的公平性问题。

Result: 在多个医学影像基准测试中，FADS持续减少了性别、种族和民族相关的差异，同时保持了强大的准确性。

Conclusion: 公平感知上下文学习为公平医学图像推理提供了可扩展和数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图表示的OOD检测方法，通过图卷积网络改进长尾分布数据集中的OOD检测性能，显著降低误报率并提升尾类分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长尾分布数据集中OOD检测的挑战，特别是高误报率和尾类分类准确率低的问题。

Method: 使用预训练模型特征空间初始化图结构，引入高斯化处理激活层分布偏差，利用图卷积网络精炼图表示以改进OOD检测。

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT和ImageNet-LT三个基准测试中，FPR和尾类ID分类准确率均大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于图表示的方法能有效提升长尾识别场景下的OOD检测性能，解决了现有方法在尾类上的性能不足问题。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Conclusion: MoR架构成功解决了现有Real-ISR模型在自适应捕获异质性特征和知识共享方面的局限性，为真实世界图像超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Conclusion: AMS-KV通过智能的KV缓存策略有效解决了视觉自回归模型中的内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了模型的可扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Conclusion: 训练策略优化是高光谱图像模型架构设计的有效补充，SpectralTrain框架具有强泛化能力

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

### [29] [VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16124)
*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker提出了一种新的视频帧插值方法，通过引导流上采样和纹理映射来解决高分辨率帧插值中的运动估计问题，避免了传统方法中的模糊、马赛克和重影现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频帧插值方法在低分辨率预测双向流后使用上采样获得高分辨率流，会导致流边缘模糊和马赛克，且无法充分捕捉高分辨率下的精细像素运动，导致任务导向流的不对齐，进而产生重影和不连续问题。

Method: VTinker包含两个核心组件：引导流上采样(GFU)和纹理映射。GFU使用输入帧作为引导来减轻双线性上采样流的模糊细节，使流边缘更清晰；纹理映射生成中间代理帧，作为从输入帧选择清晰纹理块的线索，然后通过重建模块将这些纹理块映射到代理帧上生成最终插值帧。

Result: 大量实验表明，VTinker在视频帧插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VTinker通过引导流上采样和纹理映射有效解决了高分辨率视频帧插值中的运动估计挑战，显著提升了插值质量。

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法在分布外泛化方面存在挑战，主要原因是训练时利用了虚假捷径特征。

Method: 联合训练噪声生成器和检测网络，通过交叉注意力融合视觉和类别语义特征构建正向激励噪声，在特征空间注入噪声来微调视觉编码器。

Result: 在包含42种生成模型的开放世界数据集上，平均准确率比现有方法提升5.4个百分点。

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP通过抑制捷径敏感方向、放大稳定取证线索，能够提取更鲁棒和泛化的伪影表示，有效提升AI生成图像检测的泛化性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

*Li Yu,Yingbo Zhao,Shiyu Wu,Siyue Yu,Moncef Gabbouj,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种预训练的退化表示学习模块，从视频内容中解耦和提取高维多尺度退化表示来指导伪影去除，并引入分层终止机制根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QECV方法依赖已知QP参数，但在实际转码或传输场景中QP可能未知，限制了非盲方法的适用性。当前盲方法仅捕获全局退化信息，缺乏空间细节，且所有QP使用统一架构，忽略了不同压缩级别的计算需求差异。

Method: 1. 预训练退化表示学习模块，提取高维多尺度退化表示；2. 分层终止机制，根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段数量。

Result: 在QP=22时，相比现有最优盲方法PSNR提升110%（从0.31dB到0.65dB）；分层终止机制在QP=22时平均推理时间比QP=42减少一半。

Conclusion: 该方法通过退化表示学习和自适应计算机制，显著提升了盲视频质量增强的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的多模态大语言模型缺乏人类智能的核心能力——在复杂社交互动中'察言观色'和评估欺骗的能力，需要量化这一缺陷。

Method: 引入MIDA任务和包含同步视频文本的多模态数据集，建立基准评估12个MLLM，分析失败模式，并提出Social Chain-of-Thought推理管道和Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory模块。

Result: 评估显示显著性能差距，即使是GPT-4o等强大模型也难以可靠区分真假，模型无法有效将语言与多模态社交线索相结合，缺乏建模他人知识、信念或意图的能力。

Conclusion: 需要新方法来构建更具感知力和可信度的AI系统，提出的SoCoT和DSEM框架在该挑战性任务上表现出性能提升，为构建具有真正类人社交推理能力的MLLM开辟了有前景的新路径。

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Conclusion: SR3D通过空间优先和排名感知机制成功解决了3D目标检测中的训练-推理不一致问题，为动态场景理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高空间分辨率水体变化检测数据集稀缺，且现有深度学习方法未能充分利用深度特征中的空间语义和结构信息。

Method: 设计了SSCP注意力模块，包含多语义空间注意力(MSA)、结构关系感知全局注意力(SRGA)和通道自注意力(CSA)三个组件，可集成到现有WBCD模型中。

Result: 在提出的HSRW-CD和Water-CD数据集上的大量实验验证了SSCP的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSCP模块能够充分利用水体特征的空间语义和结构信息，显著提升水体变化检测的判别能力。

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

TL;DR: LEGO-SLAM是首个在3D高斯泼溅SLAM系统中实现实时开放词汇语义映射的框架，通过场景自适应编码器将高维语言特征压缩到16维，减少内存占用并加速渲染，同时支持语言引导的剪枝和闭环检测。

Method: 提出场景自适应编码器-解码器，将高维语言嵌入压缩到16维紧凑特征空间；采用语言引导的剪枝策略识别语义冗余；利用映射特征进行基于语言的闭环检测。

Result: 将每个高斯的存储需求降低到16维，高斯数量减少超过60%，同时保持渲染质量；在15 FPS下实现竞争性的建图质量和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM成功解决了3DGS SLAM中的语义集成挑战，实现了实时开放词汇语义映射，为高级机器人交互提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Conclusion: 显式推理能有效增强嵌入质量，推理过程为嵌入提供了更好的上下文条件推理信号。

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ybrrraway/Video2Layout.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成方法仅在生成前（作为预规划）或生成后（作为后优化）进行文本推理，缺乏在生成过程中的多模态交互。

Method: 开发了TwiG框架，在视觉内容逐步生成时交织文本推理，指导即将生成的局部区域并反思已合成的区域。研究了三种策略：零样本提示、监督微调（在TwiG-50K数据集上）和强化学习（通过定制的TwiG-GRPO策略）。

Result: 这种动态交互产生了更具上下文感知和语义丰富的视觉输出。

Conclusion: 这项工作为交织文本推理以增强视觉生成的研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Conclusion: Simba框架通过分布学习方法有效解决了点云补全中的过拟合和噪声敏感问题，实现了更好的细节保留和结构完整性。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 提出LNG-SWR方法，通过层间噪声注入学习频率偏置先验，结合小波重建实现频率自适应，提升医学图像分割的鲁棒性，可单独使用或与对抗训练结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床部署需要分割模型在分布偏移和扰动下保持稳定，但对抗训练存在清洁-鲁棒性权衡和高训练成本问题，限制了医学影像中的可扩展性和可维护性。

Method: 在训练时向多层注入小噪声学习频率偏置先验，然后应用先验引导的选择性小波重建实现频率自适应：抑制噪声敏感频带、增强方向结构和形状线索、稳定边界响应，同时保持频谱一致性。

Result: 在CT和超声数据集上，LNG-SWR在清洁Dice/IoU上获得一致提升，显著减少强攻击下的性能下降；与对抗训练结合可获得额外增益，且不牺牲清洁精度。

Conclusion: LNG-SWR为医学图像分割在对抗性和标准训练机制中提供了简单、有效且工程友好的鲁棒性提升路径。

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

Motivation: 现有方法仅延迟EOS token出现来隐式延长输出，缺乏稳定性和可控性，无法直接最大化输出token长度作为明确优化目标

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 对抗提示搜索，使用强化学习策略自动识别能诱导LLM产生冗长输出的对抗提示；2) 视觉对齐扰动优化，在输入图像上构建对抗样本，最大化扰动图像视觉嵌入与对抗提示的相似度

Result: 在四个流行VLM上的综合实验表明，该方法在有效性、效率和泛化能力方面具有显著优势

Conclusion: VTIA方法能够有效诱导VLMs产生冗长输出，解决了现有方法在稳定性和可控性方面的局限性

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: EvoVLA是一个自监督的视觉语言动作模型框架，通过阶段对齐奖励、基于姿态的对象探索和长时程记忆三个组件，解决了长时程机器人操作中的阶段幻觉问题，在模拟和真实环境中都显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在长时程机器人操作中存在阶段幻觉问题，即智能体利用粗糙的评估信号来走捷径完成多步骤任务，报告高进度但未真正完成任务。

Method: 1. 阶段对齐奖励(SAR)：使用三元组对比学习和Gemini生成的硬负样本来防止视觉捷径；2. 基于姿态的对象探索(POE)：基于相对对象-夹爪姿态而非原始像素来激发好奇心；3. 长时程记忆：使用选择性上下文保留和门控融合来稳定扩展回合中的内在塑造。

Result: 在Discoverse-L长时程操作基准测试中，EvoVLA比最强基线(OpenVLA-OFT)平均任务成功率提高10.2个百分点，达到69.2%；样本效率提高1.5倍，阶段幻觉从38.5%降低到14.8%。真实世界部署在物理机器人上平均成功率达到54.6%，比OpenVLA-OFT高11个百分点。

Conclusion: EvoVLA通过其三个互补组件有效解决了阶段幻觉问题，实现了从模拟到真实世界的有效迁移和强泛化能力，显著提升了长时程机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出RF-CLIP方法，通过模拟人类注意力分散-重新聚焦行为，解决CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中注意力分散到无关token的问题，提升密集预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法很少从可解释性机制角度研究CLIP在密集预测中的性能边界，特别是CLIP会将大量注意力资源从目标区域分散到无关token，影响像素级多模态对齐。

Method: 提出ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP)，一种无需训练的方法，通过过滤维度特异性过度激活产生的干扰token，将注意力从干扰token重新聚焦到目标区域。

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保持高推理效率。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类注意力重新聚焦行为，RF-CLIP能够有效提升CLIP在多模态对齐粒度上的表现，为开放词汇语义分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型直接预测高维视觉状态会分散模型容量并带来高昂训练成本，而压缩视觉状态又会造成信息瓶颈。同时，现有方法由于忽视语言监督而缺乏理解和推理能力。

Method: 提出解耦视觉预测(DVF)框架，使用元查询和扩散Transformer头将视觉预测从主干网络中分离，通过残差连接提供当前视觉状态，让元查询自动捕捉描述视觉轨迹的潜在动作。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.7%的成功率，收敛速度快。真实世界评估显示在指令跟随、未见指令泛化和推理能力方面优于π_{0.5}模型。

Conclusion: Mantis通过解耦视觉预测有效减轻了VLA主干网络负担，使其能够通过语言监督保持理解和推理能力，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

Motivation: 现有VI-ReID算法在公共数据集上表现优异，但由于公共数据与现实数据存在差异，在实际应用中表现不佳。为解决这一问题，研究者首次探索无监督域自适应VI-ReID，旨在将公共数据学到的知识迁移到现实数据中，同时不损失精度且无需新样本标注。

Method: 设计了两阶段模型DSLGA：1）预训练阶段使用域共享学习策略(DSLS)通过利用源域和目标域之间的共享信息来缓解跨域模态差异导致的无效预训练；2）微调阶段使用渐进对齐策略(GAS)通过从聚类到整体的对齐方式处理可见光和红外数据之间的跨模态对齐挑战。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在各种设置下显著优于现有的VI-ReID域自适应方法，甚至优于一些监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 提出的DSLGA方法有效解决了VI-ReID中的跨域模态差异问题，为无监督域自适应可见光-红外行人重识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

TL;DR: VLA-Fool是首个全面研究具身视觉-语言-动作模型在多模态对抗攻击下鲁棒性的工作，揭示了即使在轻微扰动下这些系统也会出现显著行为偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在具身环境中取得了显著进展，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，特别是在现实的多模态和黑盒条件下。现有研究主要关注单模态扰动，忽视了影响具身推理和决策的跨模态失配问题。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中使用微调的OpenVLA模型进行实验表明，即使轻微的多模态扰动也会导致显著的行为偏差，揭示了具身多模态对齐的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLA模型在多模态对抗攻击下的脆弱性，强调了在具身AI系统中考虑跨模态鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: ICCE是第一个在ImageNet上准确率超过70%的完全无监督图像分类方法，缩小了与监督方法的性能差距。

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Conclusion: SwiTrack通过状态切换框架有效解决了跨模态目标跟踪中的特征提取和目标漂移问题，实现了鲁棒的实时跟踪性能

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging.

We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Abstract: We present a fast, spatio-temporal scene understanding framework based on Vision Gated Generative Transformers (VGGT). The proposed pipeline is designed to enable efficient, close to real-time performance, supporting applications including assistive navigation. To achieve continuous updates of the 3D scene representation, we process the image flow with a sliding window, aligning submaps, thereby overcoming VGGT's high memory demands. We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

TL;DR: Texture3dgs是一种针对移动GPU优化的3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)实现，通过新颖的排序算法和内存优化，在移动设备上实现了更快的3D场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用3DGS的高效性，结合移动设备部署的优势（数据隐私、离线操作、更快响应），开发针对移动GPU的优化版本。

Method: 核心是专为2D纹理缓存优化的新型排序算法，同时通过改进变量布局设计和其他优化来加速3DGS算法的其他步骤。

Result: 端到端评估显示，Texture3dgs在排序和整体3D场景重建上分别实现了4.1倍和1.7倍的加速，同时内存使用减少了1.6倍。

Conclusion: 该设计证明了在移动设备上实现高效3D场景重建的有效性。

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 尽管视觉基础模型在多样化下游任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，但其表示通常被下采样14x/16x，限制了在像素级应用中的直接使用。现有特征上采样方法依赖数据集特定的重新训练或繁重的隐式优化，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。

Conclusion: Upsample Anything提供了一种高效、通用的特征上采样解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的高分辨率重建，具有良好的跨架构和跨模态迁移能力。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Method: 将潜在狄利克雷分配(LDA)扩展到嵌入空间，推导出SAE目标作为该模型的最大后验估计器；提出SAE-TM框架：训练SAE学习可重用主题原子，将其解释为下游数据上的词分布，无需重新训练即可合并成任意数量主题。

Result: SAE-TM在文本和图像数据集上产生比强基线更连贯的主题，同时保持多样性；成功分析了图像数据集中的主题结构，并追踪了日本木版画中主题随时间的变化。

Conclusion: 该工作将SAEs定位为跨模态大规模主题分析的有效工具，为SAEs提供了新的理论解释和应用价值。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Abstract: ImageNet-1K linear-probe transfer accuracy remains the default proxy for visual representation quality, yet it no longer predicts performance on scientific imagery. Across 46 modern vision model checkpoints, ImageNet top-1 accuracy explains only 34% of variance on ecology tasks and mis-ranks 30% of models above 75% accuracy.

Motivation: 解决传统基于多视图扩散模型(MVDs)的纹理生成方法在处理遮挡区域、实现精确网格纹理对齐以及保持跨视图一致性和颜色强度连贯性方面的固有局限性。

Method: 提出潜在颜色扩散方法，包括几何感知的颜色点云VAE和多控制扩散变换器(DiT)，通过原生几何控制将3D空间信息直接嵌入DiT，并设计了紧密耦合的VAE-DiT架构。

Result: NaTex在纹理连贯性和对齐方面显著优于先前方法，并展现出强大的泛化能力，可应用于材质生成、纹理优化、部件分割和纹理化等下游任务。

Conclusion: NaTex通过原生3D纹理生成方法有效解决了传统2D多视图方法的局限性，在纹理质量和应用灵活性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE通过集成三个可解释先验，成功实现了高效且高质量的水下图像增强，为资源受限环境下的实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO通过有效利用语义信息和多尺度特征，显著提升了建筑变化检测的性能和鲁棒性，特别是在光照变化和标签稀缺场景下。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: ARASFSR通过三个创新设计成功实现了任意分辨率和任意尺度的人脸超分辨率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Motivation: 现实场景中RGB-D数据由于硬件限制和校准漂移往往存在不对齐问题，现有方法在不对齐场景下性能会显著下降。

Result: 在广泛实验中，MOMNet实现了最先进的性能，并展现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MOMNet能够有效处理不对齐的RGB-D数据，为现实场景中的深度超分辨率提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMS提出了一种基于CLIP的组合零样本学习方法，通过门控交叉注意力捕获细粒度语义特征，并在多维空间进行语义解缠，以提升对未见属性-对象组合的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的CZSL方法主要利用图像编码器获得的全局语义表示来解缠属性和对象，但这种表示能力有限，无法完全解缠两者。

Method: 设计门控交叉注意力从CLIP的高层图像编码块中捕获细粒度语义特征，同时自适应抑制背景和无关信息；然后进行多空间解缠以实现属性和对象语义的分离。

Result: 在三个流行基准测试（MIT-States、UT-Zappos和C-GQA）上，CAMS在封闭世界和开放世界设置中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMS通过提取视觉特征中的语义特征并在多维空间进行语义解缠，有效提升了组合零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的运动捕捉基本单元——刚体标记(RBM)，通过稀疏的6自由度数据和深度学习回归模型，实现了实时高精度的运动捕捉，大幅简化了传统标记系统的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于标记的光学运动捕捉系统存在准备时间过长、标记识别模糊等问题，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 引入刚体标记(RBM)作为新的数据模态，开发基于深度学习的回归模型，在测地损失下直接估计SMPL参数。

Result: 端到端方法在性能上达到基于优化方法的水平，同时计算量减少一个数量级以上，在AMASS数据集上实现了最先进的姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: 结合稀疏6自由度RBM和流形感知的测地损失，为图形学、虚拟现实和生物力学中的实时运动捕捉提供了实用且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

TL;DR: 提出一种几何引导的自监督多相机深度估计方法，通过将3D点投影到共享圆柱体上建立跨视图一致性，使用非学习的空间注意力机制聚合特征，提升深度估计的跨视图一致性和整体精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督环视深度估计方法在重叠图像间的深度估计存在不一致性问题，需要解决多相机系统中的跨视图一致性挑战。

Method: 基于相机内外参，首先预测每张图像的初始深度图，将3D点投影到共享圆柱体建立跨图像邻域关系，生成位置图，然后应用显式非学习空间注意力机制根据圆柱体上的距离聚合特征，预测最终深度图。

Result: 在DDAD和nuScenes数据集上的评估表明，该方法相比现有最优方法显著提升了跨图像深度估计的一致性和整体深度精度。

Conclusion: 提出的几何引导方法能够有效实现跨视图一致的密集度量深度估计，为多相机系统提供更可靠的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在手术场景分析中难以处理遮挡、长距离依赖关系和罕见结构的精细几何特征，这可能导致手术并发症。

Method: 提出两种分割模型：1) 静态k-NN图与GCNII结合，实现稳定的长距离信息传播；2) 动态可微分图生成器与GAT结合，支持自适应拓扑学习。两种模型均在Endoscapes-Seg50和CholecSeg8k基准上评估。

Conclusion: 图基分割方法提高了手术场景分割的性能和解剖一致性，通过结合ViT全局上下文和图基关系推理，增强了模型可解释性和可靠性，为更安全的腹腔镜和机器人辅助手术铺平道路。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语言驱动的属性泛化架构（LDAG），通过利用目标类的语言描述来构建鲁棒的支持策略，解决小样本分割中由于类内变化导致支持图像提供的元指导不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本分割方法主要从支持图像中挖掘参考信息作为元指导，但由于视觉表示的类内变化，从支持图像提取的元信息无法为未训练类别提供准确指导。本文认为支持图像提供的参考信息可能不是必需的，关键在于为训练和未训练类别提供无偏的元指导。

Method: 提出LDAG架构，包含两个核心模块：1）多属性增强（MaE）模块，通过大语言模型生成目标类的多个详细属性描述，构建精细的视觉-文本先验指导；2）多模态属性对齐（MaA）模块，实现属性文本与视觉特征之间的跨模态交互。

Result: 实验表明，该方法明显优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 利用语言描述构建支持策略比仅依赖支持图像更有效，能够为小样本分割提供更准确和无偏的元指导。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了StreetView-Waste数据集，用于城市垃圾管理中的垃圾箱检测、跟踪和溢出分割任务，并提供了基准模型和性能提升策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有垃圾检测数据集缺乏对垃圾箱溢出的专门监控，特别是在垃圾车采集图像的实际场景中，限制了在真实物流环境中的应用。

Method: 构建包含垃圾和垃圾箱的城市场景数据集，支持三个评估任务；提供最先进模型的基准测试；提出启发式垃圾箱跟踪方法和利用几何先验的模型无关分割框架。

Result: 微调的目标检测器在垃圾箱检测上表现合理，但基线跟踪方法在数量估计上困难；提出的启发式方法将平均绝对计数误差降低79.6%；几何感知策略在轻量级模型上将分割mAP@0.5提升27%。

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste为城市垃圾管理的真实感知系统研究提供了具有挑战性的基准，展示了多模态输入在此任务中的价值。

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner是一个专为视觉-语言-动作模型设计的令牌剪枝方法，通过双层级重要性标准和自适应令牌选择策略，在保持计算效率的同时提升VLA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM令牌剪枝方法仅基于语义显著性选择令牌，忽略了VLA模型的双系统特性（高层语义理解和低层动作执行），导致动作生成所需的关键信息被丢弃，严重影响VLA性能。

Method: 提出双层级重要性标准：视觉-语言预填充注意力用于语义相关性，通过时间平滑估计的动作解码注意力用于动作重要性。基于此标准设计自适应令牌选择策略，在给定计算预算下保留紧凑且信息丰富的视觉令牌。

Result: 实验表明VLA-Pruner在多种VLA架构和多样化机器人任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner通过考虑VLA模型的双系统特性和时间连续性，有效解决了现有令牌剪枝方法在VLA应用中的局限性，为实时部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: LLaVA³证明了仅使用多视角2D图像即可有效提升VLM的3D场景理解能力，无需3D训练数据或模型微调。

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Method: 提出了一种基于二阶近似的敏感度剪枝评分方法，计算每个高斯空间参数对重建误差的敏感度。采用多轮剪枝-精炼流程，可直接应用于预训练模型而无需改变训练流程。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D高斯泼溅提供了一种有效的压缩方案，在保持高质量的同时显著减少了存储和计算需求，使其更适合资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds with high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 视频预测是机器人和世界建模等下游应用的基础任务，但遮挡问题仍然是视频预测的内在挑战。作者假设提供明确的运动信息（通过点流）和几何结构信息（通过深度图）能够帮助视频预测模型在遮挡场景中表现更好。

Method: 使用标准的多对象潜在变换器架构进行未来帧预测，但修改该架构以融入深度和点流信息。在合成和真实世界数据集上进行受控评估，不仅使用基于外观的指标，还使用对象掩码上的Wasserstein距离来有效测量预测的运动分布。

Result: 研究发现，当预测模型辅助以点流和深度信息时，在遮挡场景中表现更好，并且相比不使用这些模态的模型，能够预测更准确的背景运动。

Conclusion: 通过引入点流和深度信息，视频预测模型在遮挡场景下的性能得到显著提升，这为处理复杂场景的视频预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

Motivation: 当前微机器人姿态估计方法严重依赖高质量显微镜图像数据集，但由于微机器人制造复杂和标注劳动密集，这些数据难以获取且成本高昂。数字孪生系统虽然提供了模拟到真实数据增强的途径，但现有技术难以复现复杂的光学显微镜现象。

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

Motivation: DCE-MRI在乳腺癌筛查和评估中很重要，但不同采集协议和个体因素导致组织外观差异大，使得自动肿瘤分割具有挑战性。

Method: 使用特征线性调制(FiLM)层将采集时间信息融入模型，根据特定采集序列调制模型特征，支持可变数量的图像输入。

Result: 在域内和域外数据集上的评估表明，融入相位采集时间知识改善了肿瘤分割性能和模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用图像采集时间信息可以有效提升DCE-MRI肿瘤分割的准确性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出SemCLIP方法，通过结合释义和否定处理，改进CLIP模型的对比损失函数，增强对语义变换的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP模型在处理否定和释义文本时的性能问题，因为否定会以最小词汇变化彻底改变含义，而释义会产生不同表达但相同含义的文本。

Method: 提出新的CLIP对比损失函数，结合释义和否定处理，使用LLM生成的训练三元组（原始、释义和否定文本描述）来训练CLIP类模型。

Result: 在CC-Neg基准测试中，图像检索准确率从68.1%提升至78.1%；在Sugarcrepe++基准测试中表现优于仅使用否定描述的模型；在下游零样本分类任务中表现优于CLIP。

Conclusion: SemCLIP能够显著提高对语义变换的鲁棒性，在保持CLIP性能的同时，显著增加与否定描述的距离。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体操运动员跟踪面临独特挑战：摄像机安装数量受限，以及光照、背景、服装变化和遮挡导致多摄像机检测可能失败，传统多摄像机三角测量难以准确确定3D轨迹。

Method: 提出级联数据关联范式：当交叉视图检测充分时使用三角测量生成3D轨迹候选，检测不足时采用射线-平面相交方法生成共面3D轨迹候选。

Result: 方法在挑战性场景中优于现有方法，已成功应用于体操世锦赛，获得国际体操联合会的高度认可。

Conclusion: 通过融入领域知识和级联数据关联策略，有效解决了体操运动员跟踪中的特殊挑战，实现了鲁棒的多摄像机跟踪系统。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Motivation: 生成式AI快速发展导致合成图像难以与真实内容区分，传统检测方法依赖定期重新训练，计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 第一阶段使用监督对比学习训练视觉深度学习模型提取特征嵌入；第二阶段使用k-NN分类器在嵌入空间进行少样本学习分类。

Result: 仅需每类150个样本，检测准确率达到91.3%，比现有方法提升5.2个百分点；在源归属任务中AUC和OSCR分别提升14.70%和4.27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现鲁棒、可扩展的取证归属系统提供了重要进展，能够适应不断发展的生成式AI环境而无需大量重新训练。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Conclusion: EOGS++成功扩展了高斯泼溅在遥感领域的应用，通过直接处理原始数据和集成光束法平差，实现了更好的重建质量和几何精度，同时保持了高斯泼溅的计算优势。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

Motivation: 解决VAR模型多尺度生成过程中累积KV缓存导致的内存开销问题，以及实现单模型支持从高质量到极致效率的灵活部署需求。

Method: 基于尺度-深度不对称依赖的观察，采用等距采样选择多个子网络，早期尺度使用全网络，后期尺度使用子网络；通过渐进式训练策略解决权重共享的优化冲突。

Result: 在ImageNet上，VARiant-d16和VARiant-d8几乎保持同等质量（FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95），内存减少40-65%；VARiant-d2实现3.5倍加速和80%内存减少，质量适度下降（FID 2.97）。

Conclusion: VARiant的单模型架构支持零成本运行时深度切换，为多样化应用场景提供从高质量到极致效率的灵活部署选择。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Conclusion: POMA-3D为专业和通用3D理解提供了强大骨干网络，通过点地图方式有效解决了3D表示学习中的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

Conclusion: 基于LoRA的子空间遗忘为医学图像分析提供了可控、可逆的遗忘路径，能够在遗忘敏感样本的同时保持关键性能。

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

<details>

Motivation: 传统引导方法在低光照图像上效果不佳，因为低光照图像噪声高、亮度低，缺乏足够的图像特征用于引导

Result: AGU能够使用低质量、低分辨率输入实时渲染高质量图像，实验证明在低光照场景下优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: AGU方法有效解决了低光照图像引导上采样的挑战，实现了实时高质量图像渲染

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

TL;DR: Cambrian-S提出的空间超感知视频世界模型基准测试存在缺陷，通过简单基线方法NoSense和VSC-Repeat测试显示，这些基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知能力，而Cambrian-S的推理方法利用了基准中的捷径启发式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Cambrian-S提出的空间超感知视频世界模型进行批判性分析，验证其基准测试和方法是否真正衡量了空间认知能力。

Method: 1. 提出简单基线NoSense，仅使用词袋SigLIP模型，几乎丢弃所有时间结构；2. 设计VSC-Repeat测试，将视频重复拼接1-5次，观察对象计数预测的变化。

Result: 1. NoSense在VSR基准上达到95%准确率，表明无需空间认知即可解决该基准；2. VSC-Repeat测试中，Cambrian-S的平均相对准确率从42%降至0%，证明其依赖基准中的捷径（房间不被重访）。

Conclusion: 当前VSI-Super基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知，Cambrian-S的推理方法通过利用基准捷径而非真正的空间超感知来提升性能。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Motivation: 现实世界中的目标检测面临长尾分布挑战，即多数类别只有少量实例，导致模型偏向频繁类别，在稀有类别上性能下降。

Method: 采用两阶段Faster R-CNN架构，改进平衡组Softmax框架缓解类别不平衡，并使用度量学习生成特征嵌入，结合k-NN分类器提升稀有类别分类性能。

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role.

We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner通过创新的网络架构、数据表示和训练策略，成功实现了精确灵活的多物体9自由度姿态控制，为可控图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative video models, such as Veo-3, has shown surprising zero-shot reasoning abilities, creating a growing need for systematic and reliable evaluation. We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

Conclusion: VANS成功解决了VNEP任务的挑战，为程序性学习和创造性探索提供了更直观和定制化的视频答案。

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种简单RL方法，让视觉语言模型根据任务难度自动切换快慢思考模式，在保持高性能的同时显著提高计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理模型追求冗长推理链导致计算成本过高，而人类会根据问题复杂度自动调整思考模式，需要让模型具备类似能力

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段根据模型输出长度标记快慢思考数据；第二阶段使用GRPO和思考模式标签训练模型发展双模式思考

Result: DualMindVLM显著超越基础模型，性能与最先进视觉推理模型相当，同时保持极高的token效率

Conclusion: 简单RL方法可有效实现视觉语言模型的快慢思考模式切换，在性能和效率间取得良好平衡

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型的训练依赖人工标注数据或外部奖励模型，限制了自主性和可扩展性，需要探索完全无监督的自我改进方法。

Method: 提出EvoLMM自进化框架，从单一骨干模型实例化两个协作代理：提议者生成多样化的图像基础问题，求解者通过内部一致性解决问题，通过持续自奖励过程进行学习。

Result: 以Qwen2.5-VL为基础模型时，在ChartQA、MathVista和MathVision等多模态数学推理基准上获得约3%的持续提升，仅使用原始训练图像。

Conclusion: 这种简单有效的无监督方法为未来研究自我改进的大型多模态模型提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar：一种无需姿态输入的3D人体化身重建方法，仅从单张或稀疏图像中恢复可动画的3D人体化身，解决了传统方法依赖噪声姿态估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖准确的相机姿态和人体姿态作为输入，但在实际应用中姿态估计往往存在噪声，导致重建质量显著下降。需要一种不依赖姿态输入的重建方法。

Method: 提出NoPo-Avatar方法，完全从图像中重建化身，无需任何姿态输入，避免了噪声姿态估计对重建结果的影响。

Result: 在THuman2.0、XHuman和HuGe100K数据集上的实验表明，在无真实姿态的实际场景中优于现有基线方法，在有真实姿态的实验室环境中也能达到可比效果。

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar通过消除对测试时人体姿态的依赖，有效解决了噪声姿态估计问题，具有更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了多语言LLM中思维链推理的归因模式，发现归因分数过度强调最终推理步骤，结构化CoT提示主要对高资源拉丁语系语言有效，而受控扰动会降低模型准确性和归因一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前研究证明了CoT提示在提高任务性能方面的作用，但人们对其生成推理链的忠实性和可解释性存在担忧，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 使用ContextCite进行步骤级归因和Inseq进行令牌级归因，在Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct模型上应用MGSM基准测试，并通过否定和干扰句进行受控扰动。

Result: 归因分数过度强调最终推理步骤（特别是在错误生成中），结构化CoT提示显著提高了高资源拉丁语系语言的准确性，受控扰动降低了模型准确性和归因一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了CoT提示的局限性，特别是在多语言鲁棒性和解释透明度方面。

Abstract: This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.

TL;DR: Motion2Mind是一个评估机器通过非语言线索理解心理状态能力的框架，包含精心策划的视频数据集，涵盖222种非语言线索和397种心理状态。评估显示当前AI系统在非语言线索解释方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理理论基准主要关注错误信念任务和非对称信息推理，忽视了信念之外的其他心理状态和丰富的非语言交流。需要评估机器理解非语言线索的能力。

Method: 利用专家策划的身体语言参考作为知识库，构建Motion2Mind数据集，包含细粒度非语言线索标注和手动验证的心理解释。

Result: 当前AI系统在非语言线索解释方面表现显著困难，在检测方面存在巨大性能差距，在解释方面相比人类标注者表现出过度解释的模式。

Conclusion: 机器在理解非语言线索方面仍有很大改进空间，Motion2Mind为评估机器心理理论能力提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

TL;DR: 提出了TOD-ProcBench基准，用于评估LLMs在多轮任务导向对话中理解和遵循复杂过程指令的能力，包含三个任务：相关语句检索与动作预测、违规响应识别、条件生成指令遵循响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TOD基准过于简化复杂指令为简单模式，无法评估LLMs在真实场景中遵循复杂过程指令的能力，需要系统性地评估LLMs的指令遵循能力。

Method: 基于ABCD数据集构建包含复杂过程指令和约束的基准，将细粒度约束和动作程序建模为多级条件-动作指令语句，设计三个任务全面评估LLMs的复杂指令遵循能力。

Result: 构建了包含复杂过程指令的基准数据集，设计了三个评估任务，并研究了多语言设置和不同指令文本格式对遵循性能的影响。

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench是一个具有挑战性的基准，能够系统评估LLMs在多轮任务导向对话中理解和遵循复杂过程指令的能力，填补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谎言检测技术通常在狭窄环境中验证，无法捕捉大语言模型可能生成的各种谎言类型，需要更全面的测试平台。

Method: 创建LIARS' BENCH测试平台，包含四个开源模型的72,863个谎言和诚实回答示例，涵盖七种数据集，从两个维度区分谎言类型：模型撒谎的原因和谎言针对的信念对象。

Result: 评估三种黑白盒谎言检测技术后发现，现有技术在某些类型谎言检测上系统性失败，特别是在仅凭对话记录无法确定模型是否撒谎的情况下。

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH揭示了现有技术的局限性，为谎言检测技术的进步提供了实用的测试平台。

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

TL;DR: 提出LTLA方法，通过结合语言模型和可处理的代理模型，在保持推理效率的同时提升受控文本生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有受控文本生成方法中代理模型上下文感知能力弱的问题，同时避免效率陷阱。

Method: 使用混合方法，将基础语言模型用于丰富前缀编码，与固定可处理的代理模型配对计算精确的延续概率，通过单次批量HMM更新处理所有候选标记。

Result: LTLA获得比无条件HMM更高的条件似然，在视觉语言模型中近似延续分布，在受控生成任务中提高约束满足度且保持相当的流畅性，推理开销最小。

Conclusion: LTLA方法有效解决了受控文本生成中的上下文感知和效率问题，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science. In these examples, the authors highlight how AI accelerated their work, and where it fell short; where expert time was saved, and where human input was still key. We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.

Conclusion: ELPO框架通过集成学习方法有效提升了自动提示优化的性能，为处理复杂任务提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

Motivation: 传统参数高效微调(PEFT)方法对所有位置索引都进行修改，作者质疑这种全面修改的必要性，认为可能造成资源浪费甚至负面影响。

Method: 提出TS-PEFT方法，使用选择函数S仅对部分位置索引应用PEFT修改，而非传统方法中对所有索引进行修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，对所有索引不加选择地应用PEFT不仅多余，甚至可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 为PEFT提供了新视角，倡导更针对性的修改方法，为未来大模型微调过程优化提供了框架。

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

Abstract: Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.

Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法主要依赖语义概率分布或成对距离，忽略了能够实现更精确不确定性估计的潜在语义结构信息。在安全关键场景中，可靠的不确定性量化对于避免大语言模型产生幻觉至关重要。

Method: 开发自适应稀疏有向语义图构建算法，捕捉方向性语义依赖并自动剪除引入负面干扰的不必要连接。然后通过层次抽象利用潜在语义结构信息：SeSE定义为最优语义编码树的结构熵，形式化语义空间在最优压缩后的内在不确定性。

Result: 在29个模型-数据集组合上的广泛实验表明，SeSE显著优于先进的不确定性量化基线方法，包括强监督方法和最近提出的KLE。

Conclusion: SeSE框架通过利用语义结构信息，为大语言模型提供了更可靠的不确定性量化方法，能够有效检测幻觉，在长文本生成中提供细粒度的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

TL;DR: SDA是一个无需训练、模型无关的对齐框架，通过动态重分布模型输出概率来增强LLMs与人类意图的对齐，在帮助性、无害性和诚实性方面显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保模型响应与人类意图对齐成为关键挑战。现有方法通常需要昂贵的重新训练或大量监督，因此需要开发高效、无需训练的对齐方法。

Method: 提出SDA框架，基于用户定义的对齐指令动态重分布模型输出概率，无需微调即可增强模型行为与人类意图的对齐。该方法轻量级、资源高效，兼容各种开源LLMs。

Result: 在8个不同规模和来源的开源LLMs上评估，SDA在帮助性、无害性和诚实性三个维度上平均提升64.4%、11.5%和30%，显示出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SDA是一种有效的训练无关对齐框架，能够显著提升LLMs与人类意图的对齐性能，支持个性化偏好对齐，适用于多样化模型和应用场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出自我重写框架，通过让模型重写自己的推理文本并从中学习，改善推理过程质量，解决了传统强化学习仅关注最终正确性导致的推理质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习只关注最终结果正确性，无法对内部推理过程提供详细监督，导致推理质量不佳，出现过度思考、思考不足、冗余思考和思维混乱等问题。

Method: 采用选择性重写方法，只对模型持续正确的"简单"样本进行重写，保留GRPO的所有原始奖励信号；在单个批次中同时进行重写和原始生成，保持强化学习算法的可扩展性。

Result: 在准确率-长度权衡方面，自我重写方法在准确率提升0.6%的同时，推理长度大幅减少46%；在内部推理质量方面，LLM作为评判者的评分显著提高7.2分，成功缓解了内部推理缺陷。

Conclusion: 自我重写框架有效提升了推理模型的内部分析质量，在保持准确率的同时显著缩短推理长度，优于现有强基线方法。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

*Blake Matheny,Phuong Minh Nguyen,Minh Le Nguyen,Stephanie Reynolds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了大规模习语和比喻语言数据集，用于评估预训练语言模型在习语识别任务中的表现，并通过训练和评估来提升模型处理比喻意义的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语和比喻语言在口语和书面语中占很大比例，但大型语言模型在处理这类语言时仍存在困难。虽然大语料库看似能解决所有问题，但习语和比喻语言仍然是LLMs的挑战。

Method: 使用近期习语和比喻语言数据集获取合并的习语列表，从大型语料库中检索上下文序列。创建了一个大规模潜在习语和比喻语言表达数据集，以及两个人工标注的确定习语和比喻语言表达数据集。

Result: 构建的数据集经过后处理以实现模型无关的训练兼容性，并在槽位标注和序列标注任务中进行了训练和评估。

Conclusion: 微调方法被证明是最优的，但更好更大的数据集可以进一步缩小这一差距。本文提供的数据集为构建新模型和开发新方法提供了多样化的类别基础。

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了自然语言解释（rationales）的充分性指标，发现该指标主要反映非解释性上下文对分类的干扰，而非解释本身的信息量。研究还发现将解释信息融入模型输入可以提升跨领域分类性能，但效果因任务和模型类型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用充分性指标评估自然语言解释的信息量存在局限性，无法全面反映解释信息对模型性能的影响，需要更系统地理解解释的作用机制。

Method: 通过将充分性指标与两种建模范式相关联：基于token分类的识别能力和通过注意力正则化将解释融入输入的改进能力，来深入分析解释的作用。

Result: 研究发现高度信息化的解释不一定有助于正确分类；充分性主要反映非解释性上下文的干扰作用；解释信息融入输入能提升跨领域分类但效果不稳定；充分性与token分类能力无关。

Conclusion: 自然语言解释的作用机制复杂，现有指标难以系统捕捉其信息价值，需要进一步研究更有效的评估方法。

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

TL;DR: 提出了MinerU-HTML提取管道，将HTML到文本提取重新定义为序列标注问题，使用0.6B参数语言模型，显著提升网页内容提取质量，并构建了7.3万亿token的多语言语料库AICC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页语料库依赖基于启发式的提取器（如Trafilatura），难以保留文档结构并经常损坏结构化元素（公式、代码、表格等），假设提高提取质量对下游性能的影响与积极过滤策略同样重要。

Method: 引入MinerU-HTML提取管道，将内容提取重新定义为序列标注问题，使用0.6B参数语言模型解决，采用两阶段格式化流程，先明确分类语义元素再转换为Markdown。

Result: 在MainWebBench基准测试中，MinerU-HTML达到81.8% ROUGE-N F1，显著优于Trafilatura的63.6%，结构化元素保留率极高（代码块90.9%，公式94.0%）。使用AICC语料库训练的模型在13个基准测试中平均准确率达到50.8%，优于TfCC 1.08个百分点。

Conclusion: HTML提取是网页语料库构建中关键但常被低估的组成部分，MinerU-HTML的模型驱动方法具有内在可扩展性，而启发式方法改进路径有限。

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

Motivation: 探索是否可以通过监督学习和深度学习模型有效区分感知低质量与高质量新闻文章，以应对网络新闻质量参差不齐的问题。

Method: 使用新创建的1,412,272篇英语新闻文章数据集，基于579个来源网站的专家共识评级分为低质量和高质量两类，评估了3种机器学习分类器和3种深度学习模型。

Result: 传统机器学习分类器（如随机森林）表现良好（准确率0.7355，ROC AUC 0.8131），而深度学习模型中ModernBERT-large表现最佳（准确率0.8744，ROC AUC 0.9593，F1 0.8739）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，传统CPU机器学习分类器和深度学习分类器都能有效区分全球新闻文章的感知质量，其中深度学习模型表现更优。

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TurkColBERT是首个针对土耳其语的密集编码器和延迟交互模型的综合基准测试，结果显示延迟交互模型在参数效率方面表现优异，小3-5倍的模型能显著超越密集编码器，并在特定领域任务中提升13.8%的mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经信息检索系统在高资源语言中表现出色，但对于形态丰富、资源较少的土耳其语研究不足，特别是延迟交互模型尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 采用两阶段适应流程：先在土耳其NLI/STS任务上微调英语和多语言编码器，然后使用PyLate在MS MARCO-TR上将其转换为ColBERT风格的检索器，评估了10个模型在5个土耳其BEIR数据集上的表现。

Result: 延迟交互模型参数效率极高：1.0M参数的colbert-hash-nano-tr比600M参数的turkish-e5-large小600倍，但保留了71%的平均mAP；小3-5倍的延迟交互模型显著优于密集编码器；MUVERA+Rerank比PLAID快3.33倍，mAP相对提升1.7%。

Conclusion: TurkColBERT为土耳其语检索提供了有效的基准，延迟交互模型在参数效率和性能方面具有优势，MUVERA实现了低延迟检索，但存在对中等规模数据集和翻译基准的依赖等局限性。

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型对于确保其安全有益部署至关重要，但由于LLM结构难以解释且无法对所有输出进行人工评估，这一任务变得复杂。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B模型，基于其激活状态预测输入文本的体裁，采用scikit-learn分类器进行浅层学习。

Result: 在两个数据集上，体裁预测的F1分数分别达到98%和71%，结果始终优于对照任务。

Conclusion: 这提供了一个概念验证，表明可以通过浅层学习模型从LLM中推断文本体裁。

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR在临床对话中部署日益增多，但标准评估仍主要依赖WER。需要研究WER和其他常见指标是否与转录错误的临床影响相关，以建立更有效的安全评估框架。

Method: 建立专家标注的黄金标准基准，让临床专家比较真实话语与ASR生成结果，标注差异的临床影响；引入LLM-as-a-Judge方法，使用GEPA进行程序化优化以复制专家临床评估。

Result: 分析显示WER和现有指标与临床风险标签(无影响、最小影响、显著影响)相关性差；优化的Gemini-2.5-Pro法官达到与人类相当的90%准确率和0.816的Cohen's κ。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个经过验证的自动化框架，使ASR评估从简单的文本保真度转向必要的、可扩展的临床对话安全性评估。

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前词义消歧方法主要针对粗粒度表示（如WordNet同义词集），需要人工标注训练数据，难以自动消歧更丰富的表示（如基于OpenCyc），而这是复杂推理所需的。

Method: 将符号NLU系统生成的多个候选含义转换为可区分的自然语言替代项，使用LLM作为消歧预言机，根据语言上下文选择适当解释，并将选定含义传播回符号NLU系统。

Result: 通过与人工标注的黄金答案比较来评估方法有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效进行词义消歧，无需人工标注训练数据，适用于更丰富的语义表示。

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM摘要的多模态RAG系统在预处理时将图像转换为文本，导致视觉细节和上下文信息丢失，影响下游检索和问答性能。

Method: 比较了两种检索方法：文本分块检索（图像先被LLM摘要为文本）和直接多模态嵌入检索（图像以原生形式存储在向量空间中）。在包含40个问答对的金融财报基准上评估了6个LLM模型和2个多模态嵌入模型。

Result: 直接多模态嵌入检索显著优于LLM摘要方法，mAP@5绝对提升13%，nDCG@5绝对提升11%，相对提升分别为32%和20%。直接多模态检索还产生更准确和事实一致的答案。

Conclusion: LLM摘要会在预处理阶段引入信息损失，而直接多模态嵌入能够保留视觉上下文用于检索和推理，在多模态RAG系统中具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

Abstract: Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.

Conclusion: 该框架为参数依赖矩阵方程提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案

Abstract: This work develops a non-intrusive, data-driven surrogate modeling framework based on Operator Inference (OpInf) for rapidly solving parameter-dependent matrix equations in many-query settings. Motivated by the requirements of the OpInf methodology, we reformulate the matrix equations into a structured representation that explicitly shows the parameter dependence in polynomial form. This reformulation is crucial for efficient model reduction. This approach constructs reduced-order models via regression on solution snapshots, bypassing the need for expensive full-order operators and thus overcoming the primary bottlenecks of intrusive methods in high-dimensional contexts. Numerical experiments confirm their accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that our work is a scalable and practical solution for parameter-dependent matrix equations.

Conclusion: IPVEM方法对奇异摄动问题具有有效性，即使在边界层存在时也能保持最优收敛性。

Abstract: In recent studies \cite{ZZ24, FY24}, the Interior Penalty Virtual Element Method (IPVEM) has been developed for solving a fourth-order singular perturbation problem, with uniform convergence established in the lowest-order case concerning the perturbation parameter. However, the resulting uniform convergence rate is only of half-order, which is suboptimal. In this work, we demonstrate that the proposed IPVEM in fact achieves optimal and uniform error estimates, even in the presence of boundary layers. The theoretical results are substantiated through extensive numerical experiments, which confirm the validity of the error estimates and highlight the method's effectiveness for singularly perturbed problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish universal approximation theorems for neural networks applied to general nonlinear ill-posed operator equations. In addition to the approximation error, the measurement error is also taken into account in our error estimation. We introduce the expanding neural network method as a novel iterative regularization scheme and prove its regularization properties under different a priori assumptions about the exact solutions. Within this framework, the number of neurons serves as both the regularization parameter and iteration number. We demonstrate that for data with high noise levels, a small network architecture is sufficient to obtain a stable solution, whereas a larger architecture may compromise stability due to overfitting. Furthermore, under standard assumptions in regularization theory, we derive convergence rate results for neural networks in the context of variational regularization. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the robustness of the proposed neural network-based algorithms.

Abstract: We propose an improved version of the PAMPA algorithm where the solution is sought as globally continuous. The scheme is locally conservative, and there is no mass matrix to invert. This method had been developed in a series of papers, see e.g \cite{Abgrall2024a} and the references therein. In \cite{Abgrall2025d}, we had shown the connection between PAMPA and the discontinuous Galerkin method, for the linear hyperbolic problem. Taking advantage of this reinterpretation, we use it to define a family of methods, show how to implement the boundary conditions in a rigorous manner. In addition, we propose a method that complements the bound preserving method developed in \cite{Abgrall2025d} in the sense that it is non oscillatory. A truncation error analysis is provided, it shows that the scheme should be third order accurate for smooth solutions. This is confirmed by numerical experiments. Several numerical examples are presented to show that the scheme is indeed bound preserving and non oscillatory on a wide range on numerical benchmarks.

Conclusion: eLLM框架为基于分类法的分类提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，可能显著减少对人类专家标注的依赖，通过模型多样性实现集体智能优势。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

Motivation: 现代大语言模型推理系统经常在不同任务中重复计算相似的推理步骤，浪费计算资源、增加推理延迟并限制可重现性，需要持久化推理机制来回忆和重用先前的计算轨迹。

Method: 引入图记忆推理框架，将推理工作流表示为图结构记忆，通过结构和语义相似性检索过去的决策图，实现跨新推理任务的子图组合重用。

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

Motivation: 随着多智能体强化学习系统在安全关键应用中的使用，理解智能体决策原因和集体行为实现方式变得至关重要。现有的可解释AI方法在多智能体环境中表现不佳，无法将集体结果归因于个体、量化涌现行为或捕捉复杂交互。

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

Motivation: 现有系统将网格转换为自然语言或DSL规则执行，但缺乏对编码如何影响模型感知的原则性分析，以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误。作者假设不同模态会形成不同的感知瓶颈。

Method: 使用加权集合分歧度量和两阶段推理流程，在九种文本和图像模态中分离感知与推理，测试模态对网格特征感知的影响。

Conclusion: 将表示与transformer归纳偏差对齐，并实现文本和图像之间的交叉验证，可以在不改变底层模型的情况下获得更准确的指令和更可靠的执行。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上，CoS比零样本LLM基线提升高达66%，比专业摘要方法如BRIO和PEGASUS提升高达27%。CoS摘要用更少token获得更高Q&A性能。

Conclusion: CoS为网站维护者提供了使内容更易于LLM访问的吸引人选项，同时保留人工监督的可能性，是通用目的的信息密集摘要生成的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

TL;DR: 提出了结合LLMs和AI代理的双模块框架来提升生物力学教育任务性能：使用RAG增强概念性问题回答，使用多代理系统解决计算问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在领域特定应用中存在知识鸿沟，处理需要多步推理的复杂问题时性能下降，需要开发专门的教育助手来提升生物力学课程学习效果。

Method: 构建双模块框架：1) 使用检索增强生成(RAG)提升概念性判断题的回答准确性和逻辑一致性；2) 构建多代理系统(MAS)处理需要多步推理和代码执行的计算问题。

Result: RAG显著提升了LLMs在概念性问题上的性能和稳定性，优于原始模型；多代理系统能够成功进行多步推理、方程推导、代码执行，并为计算任务生成可解释的解决方案。

Conclusion: RAG和MAS在提升LLMs在工程专业课程中的性能方面具有潜力，为开发工程教育智能辅导系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

TL;DR: 多智能体编排相比单智能体方法在事故响应中实现了100%可操作建议率，相比单智能体的1.7%有80倍行动特异性和140倍解决方案正确性提升，且零质量方差，使生产SLA承诺成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单智能体方法生成模糊、不可用的建议，无法满足生产系统事故响应的需求，需要探索多智能体编排来提升LLM在事故响应中的质量。

Method: 开发了MyAntFarm.ai可复现容器化框架，通过348次对照试验比较单智能体副驾驶与多智能体系统在相同事故场景下的表现。

Result: 多智能体编排实现100%可操作建议率，单智能体仅1.7%；行动特异性提升80倍，解决方案正确性提升140倍；多智能体系统在所有试验中展现零质量方差。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排不是性能优化，而是基于LLM的事故响应生产就绪的必要要求，为生产SLA承诺提供了确定性质量保证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Motivation: 现代AI系统依赖于复杂的数据源、预训练模型、代理和服务网络，但在关键应用中对这些供应链风险的系统性评估存在空白。

Method: 调查当前AI风险评估和管理现状，重点关注AI供应链和系统行为相关的风险，然后提出专门的AI供应链实体分类法。

Conclusion: 这项工作在当前AI治理状态与关键应用中AI使用的可操作风险评估和管理需求之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Result: 规则方法在信息检索任务中准确性更高，特别是在年龄和性别提取方面；LLM在适应性和可扩展性方面更好，在药物名称识别方面表现优异；翻译对LLM效果有影响

Conclusion: 建议采用混合方法，结合规则系统的精确性和LLM的适应性，为现实医院环境提供更可靠和资源高效的临床NLP解决方案

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR成功整合了多种技术组件，为胸部X光片解读培训提供了一个有效且可扩展的智能辅导系统。

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MAPs为评估具备适应性决策能力的智能体提供了新的基准测试基础，统一了现实决策中的多重挑战。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Motivation: 解决音频语言模型中存在的一个困惑现象：它们在没有推理的情况下表现更好，探索音频智能是否真正能从深思熟虑中受益。

Method: 提出模态接地推理蒸馏框架，让模型学习生成与音频相关的推理链，确保推理过程真正基于声学特征而非产生不相关的思考。

Conclusion: 推理是跨模态可转移的能力，当适当锚定时，扩展的深思熟虑可以从负担转变为音频智能的强大资产，为构建真正多模态推理系统开辟新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

Motivation: 探索激活引导如何改变LLM内部机制以提升心智理论能力，理解情感与认知过程在心智理论中的作用

Method: 使用对比激活加法引导Gemma-3-4B模型，在1000个BigToM前向信念场景上评估，通过45个认知行为的线性探针分析激活差异

Result: 信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升至46.7%，情感感知(+2.23)和情感价值(+2.20)激活增强，而质疑(-0.78)和聚合思维(-1.59)等分析过程被抑制

Conclusion: LLM成功的心智理论能力主要由情感理解介导，而非分析推理过程

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的自校正框架通过自信度感知奖励反馈，不仅改进了结果正确性，还提升了中间推理步骤的连贯性和忠实度。

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Motivation: 小语言模型在判断答案正确性方面的能力与大语言模型相比尚不清楚。现有的LLM-as-a-judge框架依赖与真实标签或其他候选答案的间接比较，难以完全自动化，对推理输出的细粒度可扩展评估支持有限。

Method: 构建JudgeBoard评估管道，在数学推理和科学/常识推理领域使用基于准确率的排名和Elo评分系统。提出MAJ框架，利用多个具有不同推理特征的小语言模型通过协作审议来提高判断性能。

Result: 实验结果显示小语言模型与大语言模型在独立判断任务中存在显著性能差距。但MAJ框架显著提高了小语言模型的可靠性和一致性。在MATH数据集上，使用较小模型作为骨干的MAJ表现与较大模型相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 多智能体小语言模型系统在判断任务中可能匹配或超越大语言模型的性能，这对可扩展和高效评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

Method: 通过答案到问题的反向生成自动提取知识和推理轨迹，采用启发式学习进行半监督数据增强（减少约80%手动标注需求），使用代理强化学习共同增强医学知识和推理能力。

Result: 在外部开源基准MEDQA上，知识问答能力（Accuracy@1）比SFT提高1.8%，比RAG提高3.6%；在外部基准PUMCH Antimicrobial上，推理能力（Pass@1）比SFT和RAG均提高约27%，且仅需SFT长期训练成本的约20%。

Conclusion: KRAL是增强本地LLM临床诊断能力的有效解决方案，可在复杂医疗决策支持中实现低成本、高安全性的部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Result: 在官方dolphin-llama3-8B潜伏代理模型上，系统达到92.5%准确率、100%精确度和85%召回率，实时检测（<1秒/查询）。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了AI部署中的关键安全漏洞，证明基于嵌入的检测能有效识别欺骗性模型行为且不影响部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

Motivation: 在临床环境中，LLMs即使获取了正确证据也未必能正确推理，这种检索与推理之间的差距可能带来风险，需要系统性评估。

Method: 使用书面暴露疗法(WET)指南作为测试平台，评估模型对临床问题的响应，提出评估框架来衡量准确性、一致性和推理忠实度。

Result: 检索增强生成(RAG)可以约束输出，但即使提供权威段落，错误仍然存在，需要同等严格地评估推理过程。

Conclusion: 在临床环境中安全部署LLMs需要像评估检索质量一样严格地评估推理质量，仅靠检索增强不足以确保输出符合结构化协议。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

Method: 构建类型化属性图，连接对象、人物、组织和视觉或文本标签，通过符号-神经集成统一博物馆数据，支持自然语言查询。

Result: 在真实博物馆收藏上的评估显示，在属性、关系和关联实体查询方面表现稳健，超越了大型语言模型的零样本、少样本和SPARQL提示基线。

Conclusion: 结果强调了符号基础对于可解释和可扩展的文化遗产推理的重要性，为数字遗产知识的网络规模集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的约束规划模型用于串行批处理调度问题，该模型不依赖预定义的虚拟批次集合，而是直接对相同家族作业序列进行推理，在中小规模实例上表现优越，在大规模实例上能比现有方法找到优25%的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的三个约束规划模型依赖预定义的虚拟批次集合，这会导致维度灾难并增加问题复杂性。许多实际应用（如半导体制造中的离子注入领域）需要最小批次大小约束。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的约束规划模型，使用关键对齐参数直接对机器上相同家族作业的序列进行推理，形成更紧凑的公式化。通过定制搜索阶段和增强约束传播器的推理级别来进一步改进模型。

Conclusion: 新提出的约束规划模型通过消除对虚拟批次集合的依赖，提供了更紧凑的问题表述，在串行批处理调度问题中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Result: 研究发现GenAI在民主化某些研究能力的同时，通过提高对高阶贡献的期望加剧了竞争，在人类判断、创造力和理论深度方面仍具有价值。

Conclusion: 这些转变要求改革博士教育，培养比较优势并建立AI素养，以应对AI带来的研究范式变革。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

Motivation: 传统的云边缘资源管理过于被动，依赖静态阈值导致要么资源过度配置造成浪费，要么资源不足导致性能下降，因此需要转向主动解决方案。

Method: 设计混合架构，将CNN-LSTM模型的时间序列预测结果直接嵌入到基于多智能体深度强化学习的编排器的状态空间中，使AI管理器能够预见未来并做出更好的长期决策。

Result: 测试表明该系统明显优于传统方法，能够有效解决复杂决策问题，同时平衡成本节约、系统健康和应用程序性能等多个目标。

Conclusion: 通过赋予系统预见能力，实现了从被动应对问题到主动规划平滑路径的转变，在成本效益和性能可靠性之间找到了最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有智能体训练框架在效率、工具集成和跨框架兼容性方面的不足，开发一个能够支持多轮长视野任务的高效训练框架。

Method: 采用优化的异步流水线调度器（实现1.55倍加速）、基于AST的代码搜索工具增强训练配方，以及灵活的RL框架集成（SkyRL-train、VeRL、Tinker）。

Result: 训练出的SA-SWE-32B模型在SWE-Bench Verified上达到39.4% Pass@1，相比达到相似性能的先前模型成本降低超过2倍，并能有效泛化到其他智能体任务。

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent框架通过高效调度和工具集成显著提升了智能体训练效率和性能，同时展示了良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

TL;DR: 提出了MR-RML框架，通过GPRC技术解决LLM在医疗领域的对齐挑战，显著提升了医学基准测试性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在医疗实践中面临的三大对齐挑战：静态评估与动态临床需求的脱节、难以适应多源医学标准、传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医学质量标准

Method: MR-RML框架包含三个核心创新：维度-场景-学科医学标准系统、独立多维奖励模型、几何投影参考约束，将医学认知逻辑转化为数学正则化

Result: 在权威医学基准Healthbench上，相比基础模型Qwen-32B，完整子集提升45%，困难子集提升85%，在开源LLM中达到SOTA水平

Conclusion: MR-RML框架有效解决了LLM在医疗领域的对齐问题，为医学AI的实际应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前足球视频理解方法在构建可靠逐场数据方面仍不足，通常只能辅助而非完全自动化标注。而战术建模、轨迹预测等研究已取得进展，这促使利用战术知识作为先验来支持基于计算机视觉的预测，实现更自动化和可靠的逐场数据提取。

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集为数据驱动的体育分析提供了必要的逐场数据流输入，推动了结合计算机视觉和领域知识的足球视频分析方法发展。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

Result: 形成发现、解释和泛化相互增强的闭环知识系统。

Conclusion: 这种整合将使领域从盲目搜索转向可解释的类特定算法设计，加速进展的同时产生关于优化策略何时及为何成功的可重用科学见解。

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Result: CRM和rewardBench共同提供了更透明的奖励建模和更稳定优化的实用模块化路径。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了无需额外人工标注的多视角奖励塑造，与标准RL流程兼容。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Result: 在9个数据集上的广泛实验证明了TOFA方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TOFA是一种高效、轻量级的无需训练一次性联邦视觉语言模型适应框架，能有效处理数据异构性且无需额外训练资源。

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理训练和评估数据集大多是静态和理想化的，无法反映真实环境的复杂性和不可预测性，特别是异常情况的存在。

Method: 提出D-GARA框架，引入多种真实世界异常类型（如权限对话框、电池警告、更新提示等），构建包含常用Android应用和嵌入异常的基准测试集。

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优和RL数据集成本高昂且依赖合成数据导致幻觉和多样性有限，而教科书等教育资源包含丰富高质量QA内容但难以转化为AI可用的监督数据

Method: 结合布局感知OCR和基于LLM的语义解析，自动化提取教育文档中的QA和视觉QA对

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成准确、对齐且低噪声的QA/VQA对

Conclusion: 该方法能规模化利用真实世界教育内容，为改进推理导向的LLM训练提供合成数据生成的实用替代方案

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于项目生命周期的公平感知交互推荐框架LHRL，通过生命周期感知的层次强化学习动态平衡公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视公平感知交互推荐，发现短视频平台中项目生命周期呈现压缩的三阶段模式（快速增长、短暂稳定、急剧衰减），与传统四阶段模型显著不同，这为公平性优化提供了新的控制维度。

Method: 提出LHRL框架：包含PhaseFormer（结合STL分解和注意力机制的轻量级编码器进行阶段检测）和两级HRL代理（高层策略施加阶段感知公平约束，低层策略优化即时用户参与度）。

Result: 在多个真实世界交互推荐数据集上的实验表明，LHRL显著提升了公平性和用户参与度，且将生命周期感知奖励集成到现有RL模型中也能持续获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 项目生命周期是优化推荐系统公平性的有效控制维度，LHRL框架通过解耦优化成功调和了长期公平与短期效用，具有通用性和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了多意图科学问答基准MuISQA和意图感知检索框架，通过LLM假设答案、分解意图特定查询，使用RRF重排序来提升多意图问题的证据覆盖和检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常面向单一意图，导致多意图科学问题（如基因突变识别和相关疾病关联）的证据覆盖不完整，需要从多源证据进行多跳推理。

Method: 使用LLM假设潜在答案，分解为意图特定查询，检索每个意图的支持段落，然后通过RRF聚合和重排序以平衡不同意图的覆盖并减少冗余。

Result: 在MuISQA基准和其他通用RAG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖方面持续优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 意图感知检索框架能有效解决多意图科学问答中的证据覆盖不足问题，显著提升RAG系统性能。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

TL;DR: 本文展示了一个跨分布式系统的代理间通信概念验证，仅使用自然语言消息，无需共享标识符、结构化模式或集中式数据交换。通过伪匿名令牌、本地数据查找和受控操作边界实现多组织安全协作。

Motivation: 探索多个组织（诊所、保险公司、专科网络）如何通过伪匿名案例令牌、本地数据查找和受控操作边界进行安全协作，实现分布式推理，同时保持每个组织的数据本地化。

Method: 使用Orpius作为多代理编排、工具执行和隐私保护通信的基础平台。所有代理通过OperationRelay调用进行通信，交换简洁的自然语言摘要。诊所计算基于HMAC的伪匿名令牌，保险公司评估覆盖规则并咨询专科代理，专科代理返回适当性建议。

Conclusion: 该原型证明了分布式多代理系统的可行性，为更严格的评估和未来研究提供了基础，强调了在保持数据本地化的同时实现多组织协作的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

This work integrates into MalDataGen a Super-Metric that aggregates eight metrics across four fidelity dimensions, producing a single weighted score. Experiments involving ten generative models and five balanced datasets demonstrate that the Super-Metric is more stable and consistent than traditional metrics, exhibiting stronger correlations with the actual performance of classifiers.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

Method: 使用C/C++程序作为输入，通过LLM生成HDL设计，用RAG机制修复语法错误，通过比较模拟行为与HLS参考设计来迭代改进功能正确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的电路在面积和功耗效率上显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计质量，同时保持功能正确性。

Conclusion: CorrectHDL框架有效结合了LLM的生成能力和传统IC设计流程的严谨性，展示了代理式HDL设计的潜力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Motivation: 当前企业不信任AI代理处理生产数据，因为传统湖仓不适合代理访问模式，需要从基础设施层面解决信任问题。

Method: 借鉴数据库MVCC概念但重新设计以适应解耦、多语言环境，提出Bauplan架构，在湖仓中重新实现数据和计算隔离。

Result: 开发了Bauplan参考实现，展示了一个自愈管道，无缝结合了代理推理与正确性和信任所需的保证。

Conclusion: 通过优先解决基础设施问题，设计代理优先的湖仓架构，可以为可信代理工作流铺平道路，治理自然随之而来。

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

Motivation: ESG报告作为评估企业ESG表现的核心媒介，存在阅读顺序混乱（类似幻灯片的非规则布局）和隐含层次结构（冗长、弱结构化内容）的问题，难以进行大规模理解。

Method: Pharos-ESG框架包含：基于布局流的阅读顺序建模模块、目录锚点引导的层次感知分割模块、将视觉元素上下文转化为连贯自然语言的多模态聚合管道，并进一步丰富ESG、GRI和情感标签。

Result: 在标注基准上的广泛实验表明，Pharos-ESG始终优于专用文档解析系统和通用多模态模型。同时发布了Aurora-ESG数据集，涵盖中国大陆、香港和美国市场。

Conclusion: 该框架为金融治理和决策中的ESG整合提供了更好的支持，通过结构化表示和多模态内容分析，提升了ESG报告的可理解性和分析价值。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症患者(PLwD)的沟通行为会随时间逐渐变化，但现有计算工具缺乏跟踪这种渐进行为漂移的能力。

Method: 基于护理人员访谈创建合成用户模型，模拟60天交互日志，注入渐进式的情感扁平化和语义漂移变化，评估多种异常检测方法包括统计模型、序列模型和监督分类器。

Result: 情感扁平化在低基线变异性用户中可用简单统计模型检测，而语义漂移需要时序建模和个性化基线。个性化分类器在所有任务中都优于通用分类器。

Conclusion: 个性化行为上下文对于检测痴呆症患者沟通行为渐进变化至关重要，PersonaDrift为这一新兴应用领域提供了评估框架。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

Conclusion: CLOZE框架能够有效利用临床笔记扩展医学本体，填补了该领域的空白，为生物医学研究和临床应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Conclusion: ALEs方法成功地将案例推理模型的可解释性与形式化XAI的保证相结合，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的解释机制。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

Conclusion: YOFO设计实现了数量级的速度提升，同时保持可解释性，有效解决了MLLM评估中的速度与精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能中的两个主要挑战：真实世界数据稀缺昂贵的数据瓶颈，以及现有方法资源消耗大的算法效率问题。

Method: DPPO框架包含监督微调（能力扩展）和强化学习（技能精炼）的动态交替训练，能够自动识别弱点并进行针对性资源分配。

Result: 训练出的Pelican-VL 1.0模型相比基础模型性能提升20.3%，在100B参数规模上超越开源模型10.6%。

Conclusion: DPPO是首个系统性缓解数据和资源瓶颈的框架，使社区能够高效构建多功能具身智能体，相关模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite是一个轻量级的贝叶斯增强框架，用于transformer临床语言模型，通过集成不确定性量化来产生可靠、不确定性感知的预测，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: transformer模型在临床决策支持中表现出潜力，但在模糊医疗案例中容易过度自信，需要校准的不确定性来确保可靠性。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：贝叶斯嵌入校准（使用蒙特卡洛dropout）、不确定性加权注意力（对token可靠性进行边际化）、置信度引导决策塑造（受临床风险最小化启发）。

Result: 在生物医学QA和临床预测基准测试中，MedBayes-Lite持续改善校准和可信度，将过度自信减少32-48%。在模拟临床环境中，通过标记不确定预测供人工审查，可预防高达41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: MedBayes-Lite能有效实现可靠的不确定性传播，提高医疗AI系统的可解释性，且参数开销低于3%。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型能解决复杂问题却在简单变体上失败，表明它们通过不同于人类推理的机制获得正确答案。研究旨在理解模型与人类推理的根本差异，为开发基于原则性认知机制而非脆弱捷径的模型奠定基础。

Method: 综合认知科学研究构建28个认知元素的分类法，分析170K个模型推理轨迹和54个人类思维轨迹，进行大规模比较分析。对1,598篇LLM推理论文进行元分析，并开发测试时推理指导方法。

Conclusion: 通过桥接认知科学和LLM研究，为开发基于原则性认知机制而非脆弱捷径的模型奠定基础，为改进模型能力和大规模测试人类认知理论开辟新方向。

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

TL;DR: 论文提出了3D测试时扩展框架，通过整合上下文长度、批处理和轮次三个维度的扩展来增强推理强化学习的测试时推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展受限于基础模型的有限上下文长度，远小于训练时消耗的token数量，需要探索更多维度的测试时扩展方法。

Method: 提出3D测试时扩展框架，包括：上下文长度扩展（增加推理上下文）、批处理扩展（并行采样提升准确率）、轮次扩展（迭代自优化提升推理质量）。

Result: 每个维度都表现出测试时扩展效应但容量有限；三个维度结合显著提升IOI、IMO和CPHO等挑战性测试集的推理性能，并能从人类偏好反馈中获益；该框架可扩展到具身学习领域用于设计人形控制行为。

Conclusion: 多维度测试时扩展框架能够有效突破单一上下文长度扩展的限制，显著提升推理模型的性能，并在开放领域如具身学习中展现出应用潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.

Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.

TL;DR: TopoReformer是一个模型无关的文本图像重构管道，利用拓扑特征来减轻对抗性扰动，同时保持文本图像的结构完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法通常模型特定、计算昂贵，且影响未扰动输入的性能，同时仍容易受到未知或自适应攻击。对抗性扰动图像可能导致OCR系统产生误导性转录，带来安全风险。

Method: 利用拓扑学特征，采用拓扑自编码器在潜在空间中强制流形级一致性，无需显式梯度正则化。

Result: 在EMNIST、MNIST数据集上对标准对抗攻击（FGSM、PGD、Carlini-Wagner）、自适应攻击（EOT、BDPA）和OCR特定水印攻击（FAWA）进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: TopoReformer通过拓扑特征提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了文本图像的结构完整性。

Abstract: Adversarially perturbed images of text can cause sophisticated OCR systems to produce misleading or incorrect transcriptions from seemingly invisible changes to humans. Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的低噪声条件——模型边界噪声(MM噪声)假设，并在此条件下推导了增强的H-一致性边界。MM噪声比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱，能够提供与Tsybakov噪声条件下相同的有利指数但假设更弱，并在中间噪声水平下平滑插值线性和平方根机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Tsybakov噪声条件可能过于严格，作者希望提出一个更弱的噪声假设条件，该条件依赖于给定假设与贝叶斯分类器之间的差异，而非内在分布的最小边界，从而能够覆盖更多实际场景。

Method: 引入模型边界噪声(MM噪声)假设，该假设比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱，然后在此条件下推导增强的H-一致性边界，包括二元和多类分类情况。

Result: 获得了与Mao、Mohri和Zhong(2025a)相同有利指数的增强H-一致性边界，但在比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱的假设下实现，并在中间噪声水平下实现了线性和平方根机制之间的平滑插值。

Conclusion: MM噪声假设是一个比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱的有效替代方案，能够提供增强的H-一致性边界，为分类问题中的噪声处理提供了更灵活的理论框架。

Abstract: We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.

Motivation: 标准在线保形预测存在两个关键限制：在输出空间使用简单非保形分数，以及统一处理所有历史观测值进行分位数估计

Method: AFOCP在预训练神经网络的特征空间操作，利用学习到的表示构建更紧凑的预测集；同时引入注意力机制自适应加权历史观测值

Result: AFOCP在合成和真实时间序列数据集上比标准OCP减少预测区间大小达88%，同时保持目标覆盖率

Conclusion: AFOCP通过特征空间校准和注意力加权有效处理非平稳性和分布漂移，在理论保证下实现更紧凑的预测集

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法虽然预测性能高，但缺乏透明性和鲁棒性，限制了临床采用。需要开发既准确又可信的预测系统。

Method: 使用逻辑回归模型融合两个模态特定模型：双向LSTM处理生命体征数据，微调ClinicalModernBERT处理临床笔记。采用后期融合架构实现多级可解释性。

Result: 在MIMIC-III基准测试中，多模态集成优于最佳单模型（AUPRC 0.565 vs 0.526；AUROC 0.891 vs 0.876），保持良好校准预测，并在模态缺失时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持竞争力的同时，提供可靠、可审计的风险评估和透明、可预测的操作，这对临床应用至关重要。

Abstract: Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.

TL;DR: GLOBE是一种用于齐次PDE的新型神经代理模型，结合边界元方法和等变机器学习，在AirFRANS数据集上实现了比基线模型高200倍的精度提升，具有紧凑的参数规模（117k）和任意点评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有严格物理和领域启发的归纳偏置的PDE代理模型，以提高工业计算机辅助工程中基于机器学习的PDE代理的准确性、泛化性和实用性。

Method: GLOBE将解表示为可学习的类格林函数核的叠加，从边界面评估到目标点，通过多尺度分支和通信超层组合。架构具有平移、旋转和宇称等变性，在细网格极限下离散不变，并通过严格的无量纲化实现单位不变。

Result: 在AirFRANS数据集上，GLOBE在"Full"分割上相对于参考基线将均方误差降低了约200倍，在"Scarce"分割上比Transolver在速度和压力场上误差低100倍以上，表面压力误差低600倍以上。模型紧凑（117k参数），支持任意点评估和非水密网格训练。

Conclusion: 严格的物理和领域启发的归纳偏置可以在基于机器学习的PDE代理中实现准确性、泛化性和实用性的大幅提升，对工业计算机辅助工程具有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

Motivation: 推测采样通过使用廉价的草稿模型来减少自回归解码的延迟，但多草稿扩展中的最优传输问题计算复杂度过高，难以实际应用。

Abstract: Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

Abstract: Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.

Conclusion: 统一的谱潜在空间能有效利用更大更丰富的MIR数据集，提升当前NIR库中代表性不足的土壤属性预测性能。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.

Conclusion: 基于代理的SEIRV模型结合机器学习算法能有效预测无线传感器网络中的病毒传播，为网络安全提供有力工具。

Abstract: The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘算法旨在无需从头重新训练即可移除选定训练数据对模型的影响，但随机版本的D2D虽被广泛实现却缺乏理论支持。

Method: 通过分析扰动或有偏梯度系统（收缩、半收缩或扩张），使用最优耦合方法结合新型松弛高斯机制来实现(ε, δ)遗忘。

Result: D2D在强凸函数上能提供比R2D更严格的保证，而R2D在凸和非凸设置下也能实现遗忘，因为它通过逆转累积扰动将遗忘模型拉近重新训练模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为随机R2D和D2D算法提供了理论保证，填补了现有实践与理论之间的空白，特别是在非凸函数上的遗忘保证。

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合子治疗组对齐和随机时间掩码的新框架，用于从时间序列观测中估计反事实结果，在治疗效果估计方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从时间序列观测估计反事实结果对于有效决策至关重要，但由于反事实轨迹从未被观察到且混杂因素随时间演变，这一任务极具挑战性。

Method: 整合两种互补方法：子治疗组对齐通过迭代治疗无关聚类识别细粒度子治疗组来实现更好的分布匹配；随机时间掩码通过随机用高斯噪声替换输入协变量来促进时间泛化。

Result: 实验表明，单独应用SGA和RTM都能改进反事实结果估计，但它们的协同组合始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SGA和RTM具有不同但互补的作用：RTM增强时间泛化和跨时间步的鲁棒性，而SGA改进每个特定时间点的去混杂效果。

Abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.

Conclusion: HGCN2SP通过深度整合场景信息和优化场景顺序，有效解决了传统两阶段随机规划方法的局限性，为大规模不确定决策问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

*Alex Ning,Vainateya Rangaraju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种旋转不变的两子空间径向激活函数（TSRA），使网络对正交线性变换具有不变性，从而支持基变换剪枝（CoB）。该方法在VGG-16上实现了70%参数剪枝而无需微调，90-96%参数剪枝后精度仅下降1-6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化剪枝的有效性取决于重要性在表示空间中的分布。基变换剪枝通过正交线性变换将重要性集中在特定维度，但标准深度学习架构对此类变换不具有固有不变性。

Method: 引入两子空间径向激活函数（TSRA），该激活函数族对其两个激活子空间内独立应用的正交线性变换具有不变性，使基变换可以合并到周围权重中而不增加额外参数。

Result: 在VGG-16上，CoB+TSRA框架在固定比例结构化剪枝中，将可靠剪枝前沿从约30%扩展到70%参数而不需要剪后微调；在基于阈值的剪枝策略中，剪除90-96%参数后精度仅下降1-6%。

Conclusion: 旋转不变架构为实现基变换剪枝提供了一条有前景的路径，尽管当前实现相比ReLU基线有4.52%的精度下降，但展示了该方法的潜力。

Abstract: Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.

*Yoonhyuk Choi,Chong-Kwon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GESC模型，通过投影式干扰机制和相位感知门控解决GNN在异配图上的性能问题，在多个图基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在同配图上表现良好，但在异配图上由于自增强和相位不一致信号而性能下降，需要新的消息传递机制。

Method: 使用U(1)相位连接和秩1投影来衰减自平行分量，引入符号和相位感知门控来调节邻居影响，作为局部陷波滤波器。

Result: 在多样化图基准测试中，GESC模型持续优于最新的最先进模型。

Conclusion: GESC提供了一个统一的、干扰感知的消息传递视角，有效解决了GNN在异配图上的性能问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing.

*Junchao Zhou,Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ILoRA框架解决联邦学习中LoRA面临的三个关键挑战：初始化不稳定性、秩不兼容和聚合误差、非IID数据下的客户端漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的低秩适应(LoRA)在客户端异构性下面临初始化导致的子空间错位、不同秩参数聚合时的偏差、以及非IID数据加剧的客户端漂移问题。

Method: ILoRA框架包含三个核心创新：QR正交初始化确保客户端子空间一致性；串联QR聚合机制融合异构秩更新；AdamW优化器配合秩感知控制变量校正本地更新。

Result: 理论收敛保证支持，在视觉和NLP基准测试中，ILoRA相比现有联邦LoRA方法始终获得更优的准确性和收敛稳定性。

Conclusion: ILoRA通过统一的框架有效解决了联邦LoRA在客户端异构环境下的关键挑战，显著提升了性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于小语言模型的两步微调方法，通过监督微调和GRPO强化学习优化简历评估模型，克服传统ATS系统的关键词匹配局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ATS系统过于依赖关键词匹配，容易因语义不匹配而拒绝优秀候选人，需要更智能的简历评估方法。

Method: 首先使用监督微调建立基线模型，然后通过GRPO强化学习在定制奖励函数下优化模型，采用温和的奖励函数优化策略避免奖励黑客问题。

Result: 最终模型在未见测试数据上达到91%准确率，对'SELECTED'类别的召回率为0.85，精确度为1.0，表现出色。

Conclusion: 两步微调方法能有效优化小语言模型进行类人简历评分，克服传统ATS和朴素RL方法的缺点。

Abstract: Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.

*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应正交多项式滤波器(AOPF)来解决谱GNN的异质性和过平滑问题，包括L-JacobiNet(自适应ChebyNet)和S-JacobiNet(静态ChebyNet+LayerNorm)，发现[0,∞)域更适合异质性建模，而[-1,1]域(Jacobi)在高阶时数值稳定性更好，且ChebyNet的主要问题是稳定性而非静态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统谱GNN如ChebyNet由于静态低通滤波器设计，受到异质性和过平滑问题的限制，需要研究自适应正交多项式滤波器作为解决方案。

Method: 提出了两种在[-1,1]域操作的模型：1) L-JacobiNet - 具有可学习alpha、beta形状参数的自适应ChebyNet；2) S-JacobiNet - 使用LayerNorm稳定的静态ChebyNet。并与[0,∞)域的AOPF模型进行比较分析。

Result: [0,∞)域在建模异质性方面更优，而[-1,1]域(Jacobi)在高阶(K>20)时提供更好的数值稳定性。静态S-JacobiNet在5个基准数据集中的4个上优于自适应L-JacobiNet。

Conclusion: ChebyNet的主要缺陷是稳定性问题而非静态特性，S-JacobiNet是一个强大但被忽视的基线模型，[-1,1]域的自适应可能导致过拟合。

Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

TL;DR: AssayMatch是一个数据选择框架，通过数据归因方法量化每个训练实验对模型性能的贡献，并微调基于文本的实验描述嵌入，从而构建更同质化的训练集，提高药物发现中机器学习模型的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现中机器学习模型的性能高度依赖训练数据的质量和一致性。由于数据集规模限制，模型通常需要聚合来自不同来源的生物活性数据，但这种方法会因实验协议的可变性引入显著噪声。

Method: 利用数据归因方法量化每个训练实验对模型性能的贡献，使用这些归因分数微调基于文本的实验描述嵌入，不仅捕捉语义相似性，还捕捉实验间的兼容性。在测试时，使用微调后的嵌入对所有可用训练数据进行排名。

Result: 使用AssayMatch选择的数据训练的模型能够超越在完整数据集上训练的模型性能，在9/12的模型-目标对上表现出比仅使用语言基线的预测能力提升。

Conclusion: AssayMatch提供了一个数据驱动的机制来策划更高质量的数据集，减少不兼容实验带来的噪声，提高药物发现模型的预测能力和数据效率。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

Motivation: 连续控制中的确定性策略梯度算法存在价值估计偏置问题，双评论家虽能减少偏置，但双演员的探索潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 基于TDDR框架，提出三种凸组合策略（对称和非对称），通过单一超参数控制偏置机制，并在演员和评论家网络中整合增强状态和动作表示。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法持续优于基准方法，证明了可调偏置的价值，并揭示了在不同环境中可以不同方式利用高估和低估偏置。

Conclusion: 通过双演员-评论家框架实现了灵活的偏置控制和更强的表示学习，在连续控制任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HybSpecNet是一个混合域图神经网络，通过结合稳定的ChebyNet分支和自适应的KrawtchoukNet分支，解决了谱图神经网络中"稳定性vs适应性"的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谱图神经网络面临基本权衡：有限域[-1,1]的滤波器（如ChebyNet）数值稳定但静态低通，无法处理异质图；半无限域[0,∞)的滤波器（如KrawtchoukNet）自适应性强但在高多项式度K时数值不稳定。需要设计既能保持稳定性又具备适应性的架构。

Method: 提出HybSpecNet混合架构：1）初始采用简单拼接融合的"naive"混合架构；2）发现该架构存在"不稳定性毒化"问题；3）提出使用"Late Fusion"的先进架构，完全隔离梯度路径。

Result: 简单混合架构在低K时表现良好，但在K=25时发生灾难性崩溃；Late Fusion架构在K=30时仍保持完美稳定性，同时在所有图类型上保持SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作识别了混合GNN设计中的关键架构陷阱，并提供了稳健的架构解决方案，成功解决了谱图神经网络的稳定性与适应性权衡问题。

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效学习噪声数据的分布，提供高效的轨迹生成解决方案，并具有良好的可解释性和下游任务适用性。

Abstract: Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了负责任的合成数据生成实用框架，同时批判性地指出了其局限性，强调可信AI的未来需要在合成效用和真实世界真实性之间权衡取舍。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

Conclusion: 研究结果支持时间序列异常检测研究应转向以数据为中心，强调标签利用而非纯粹的算法复杂性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing need for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) to improve flexibility in order to match the rapid growth of renewable energies. The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.

The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.

Abstract: The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.

Abstract: Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.

Result: 实验表明DirPA成功调整了决策边界，通过作为动态特征正则器稳定了训练过程。

Conclusion: DirPA方法能够有效处理农业作物分类中的类别不平衡问题，提升模型在真实世界条件下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

Abstract: Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效处理高维两人零和博弈问题，通过过松弛技术显著提升收敛速度，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.

TL;DR: 论文分析了pass@k指标作为强化学习优化目标的问题，发现它本质上是pass@1的加权版本，在需要探索时提供的学习信号很弱，可能导致探索崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和增强大语言模型的复杂推理能力是AI研究的重点，pass@k指标被广泛用作评估标准和优化目标，但其作为直接优化目标的有效性需要分析。

Method: 分析pass@k目标函数，推导其梯度，证明它是pass@1的逐样本正加权版本，并分析探索崩溃的动态过程。

Result: pass@k目标在探索关键阶段提供的学习信号趋于消失，随着策略概率集中，pass@k与pass@1的差距缩小。

Conclusion: pass@k作为诊断工具有用，但不适合作为直接优化目标，应使用明确鼓励高效探索的机制来改进推理任务的强化学习。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 轻量级、原型中心的方法提供了实用且强大的替代方案，实现了卓越的检索性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

Result: 经验证明该方法能可靠生成分布内且结构差异最小的反事实，适用于离散分类目标和连续属性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了图数据反事实解释生成的挑战，为图模型可解释性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.

Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: 现代学习机制可以作为传统观测器设计的强大补充，在不确定系统中实现更准确和鲁棒的状态估计。

Abstract: This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

Abstract: Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.

This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.

Conclusion: 尽管基础模型具有通用性，但在企业破产预测任务中，当前的专用方法仍然比基础模型更有效。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

Abstract: We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

Abstract: Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreqFlow是一个在频域中使用条件流匹配进行确定性多变量时间序列预测的轻量级框架，通过单次ODE积分实现高效预测，参数仅89k，比扩散模型小一个数量级。


<details>

Result: 在真实世界交通速度、流量和流量数据集上的实验表明，FreqFlow实现了最先进的预测性能，平均RMSE提升7%，同时显著更快且参数效率更高。

Conclusion: 频域条件流匹配为多变量时间序列预测提供了一种高效、轻量级的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods

Abstract: Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较决策变换器与传统离线强化学习算法在ANT连续控制环境中稠密和稀疏奖励设置下的性能，发现DT对奖励密度变化不敏感且在稀疏奖励场景表现优异，而传统方法在稠密奖励和高质量数据下更有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线RL算法在平衡探索与利用方面面临挑战，特别是在不同奖励密度的环境中。决策变换器将离线RL重构为序列建模问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色，需要比较其与传统方法在不同奖励结构下的表现。

Method: 在ANT连续控制环境中进行实证分析，比较决策变换器与传统离线RL算法（如CQL和IQL）在稠密和稀疏奖励设置下的性能，评估它们在不同数据质量和奖励结构下的学习能力和泛化能力。

Result: DT对奖励密度变化不敏感，在稀疏奖励场景中特别是中等专家数据集上表现优异；IQL在稠密奖励设置和高质量数据下表现更好；CQL在不同数据质量下提供平衡性能；DT性能方差较低但计算资源需求显著更高。

Conclusion: 序列建模方法更适合奖励结构不确定或数据质量混合的场景，而基于价值的方法在稠密奖励和高质量演示的设置中仍具有竞争力。

Abstract: The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

### [253] [Limitations of Scalarisation in MORL: A Comparative Study in Discrete Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16476)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多目标强化学习(MORL)中线性标量化函数和切比雪夫标量化函数的局限性，发现这些函数在复杂环境中难以准确逼近帕累托前沿，且性能高度依赖于环境和帕累托前沿形状。相比之下，内循环多策略算法提供了更稳健的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标量化函数在MORL算法中被广泛使用，但在复杂不确定环境中往往难以准确逼近帕累托前沿。本研究旨在深入探讨标量化方法在多目标决策中的局限性。

Method: 采用外循环多策略方法评估MO Q-Learning算法（使用线性标量化和切比雪夫标量化函数），并探索内循环多策略算法Pareto Q-Learning。在具有离散动作和观察空间的MORL环境中进行测试。

Result: 标量化函数的性能高度依赖于环境和帕累托前沿形状，这些函数往往无法保留学习过程中发现的解，且偏向于在解空间的特定区域寻找解。找到合适的权重配置来采样整个帕累托前沿非常复杂。

Conclusion: 内循环多策略算法可能提供更可持续和可泛化的方法，在动态和不确定环境中促进智能决策，而标量化方法在不确定环境中的适用性有限。

Abstract: Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 提出了ExCIR和BlockCIR两种相关性感知的归因方法，通过稳健中心化和分组处理解决现有方法计算成本高、稳定性差和扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型日益复杂和高风险应用对透明度的需求增加，现有全局归因方法存在计算成本高、在相关输入下缺乏稳定性、难以扩展到大型或异构数据集的问题。

Method: ExCIR通过稳健中心化（减去中位数或中均值）量化特征与模型输出之间的符号对齐共变关系，并引入轻量级传输协议；BlockCIR是ExCIR的组扩展，将相关特征集作为单个单元评分，通过预定义或数据驱动的分组聚合来减轻共线集群中的重复计数。

Result: 在文本、表格、信号和图像等多种数据集上，ExCIR与现有全局基准和完整模型显示出可信的一致性，在不同设置下提供一致的top-k排名，并通过在数据子集上的轻量级评估减少运行时间。

Conclusion: ExCIR为实际部署提供了计算高效、一致且可扩展的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

Conclusion: ODE-ViT提供了一种参数效率高、稳定且可解释的Vision Transformer替代方案，通过ODE框架和教师-学生学习策略实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.

Motivation: 现有的标签错误检测方法需要能够抵抗标签错误的模型，但获取这种模型通常需要在被污染的数据上训练，这是一个挑战。受Focal Loss（关注难以分类样本）启发，希望通过调整损失函数来改进。

Method: 提出了两种新颖而简单的损失函数：一种降低困难样本的权重，另一种完全忽略这些可能包含标签错误的困难样本。

Result: 在人工污染数据上的实验结果显示，相比传统的分类交叉熵和Focal Loss基线，检测标签错误的F1分数有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过调整损失函数来降低或忽略困难样本的权重，可以有效改进训练数据中标签错误的检测性能。

Abstract: Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

Conclusion: 动态客户端参与是联邦学习中的重要挑战，提出的基准框架和KPFL方法为解决这一问题提供了有效工具

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: 这是首个主要利用SVD进行公平性增强而非压缩的工作，为深度学习模型公平性提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.

Conclusion: BSCRLS算法通过自适应约束随机参数范围，解决了BRLS普遍逼近性质对随机参数选择敏感的问题，实现了基于范数收敛的严格普遍逼近。

Abstract: Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.

Abstract: Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.

Abstract: Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECPv2是一个可扩展的全局优化算法，针对Lipschitz连续函数，解决了ECP算法的高计算成本和保守行为问题，通过自适应下界、固定内存机制和随机投影等创新，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ECP算法在全局优化中的关键限制：高计算成本、早期行为过于保守，以及在高维空间中的计算效率问题。

Method: 引入三个创新：(1)自适应下界避免无效接受区域，(2)Worst-m内存机制限制与固定大小历史评估子集的比较，(3)固定随机投影加速高维距离计算。

Result: ECPv2在保持ECP无遗憾保证和最优有限时间界的同时，以高概率扩展接受区域。在广泛的高维非凸优化问题中，ECPv2始终匹配或优于最先进的优化器，并显著减少实际运行时间。

Conclusion: ECPv2是一个理论上有保证且实际高效的全局优化算法，通过关键创新解决了ECP的局限性，在性能和计算效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.

*Amartya Mukherjee,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了差分隐私随机梯度下降（DP-SGD）及其动量变体在标准平滑性假设下几乎必然收敛，为差分隐私优化提供了更强的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DP-SGD已成为训练具有严格隐私保证的机器学习模型的标准算法，但其长期行为的理论理解仍然有限。现有分析通常只建立期望收敛或高概率收敛，未能解决单条轨迹的几乎必然收敛问题。

Method: 在标准平滑性假设下，通过证明DP-SGD在非凸和强凸设置下几乎必然收敛，只要步长满足某些标准衰减条件。分析扩展到动量变体如随机重球法（DP-SHB）和Nesterov加速梯度（DP-NAG），通过精心构造能量函数获得类似保证。

Result: 证明了DP-SGD及其动量变体在非凸和强凸设置下几乎必然收敛，表明尽管存在隐私引起的失真，算法在凸和非凸机制中仍然保持路径稳定性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为差分隐私优化提供了更强的理论基础，表明尽管有隐私引起的扭曲，算法在凸和非凸机制中仍然保持路径稳定性。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.

Abstract: Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

Conclusion: EGGROLL成功解决了进化策略在大规模优化中的可扩展性问题，为大规模神经网络的无反向传播优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

Abstract: Supplying spare parts from Earth for in space repair is economically prohibitive and logistically slow, posing a major barrier to sustainable space operations. As lunar and Martian missions accelerate in the coming decades, the feasibility of in-situ repair methods, particularly laser based welding, must be rigorously evaluated. The micro scale physics governing weld quality are fundamentally altered by variations in gravity and ambient pressure, yet their coupled influence across different welding regimes remains poorly understood. This work introduces a fully open-source thermo-fluid-microstructure modeling framework with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and cellular automata (CA) to quantify how gravitational conditions reshape weld pool behavior across multiple welding regimes and spatial scales. The framework further enables prediction of the resulting microstructure from imposed process parameters, providing an accessible pathway for future research in in space manufacturing (ISM). As a demonstration, the article analyzes laser welding of Al6061 across three process regimes (conduction, transition, and keyhole) and four gravitational environments (Earth, Moon, Mars, and International Space Station (ISS)). Analysis reveals that reduced gravity suppresses buoyancy-driven convection, thereby altering melt pool geometries. Vacuum conditions increase laser energy deposition, while microgravity promotes equiaxed grain formation via reduced melt convection. The framework captures keyhole dynamics, thermal histories, and grain morphologies with high fidelity, validated against experimental data. These findings establish process microstructure relationships critical for reliable metallic fabrication in space and provide a reproducible platform for future in-space manufacturing research.

Abstract: Shallow flows are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. They are commonly modelled using the shallow water equations, a great simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations, which often yields inaccurate results. For that reason, a model called shallow water moment equations has been developed. It uses more equations and variables than the shallow water equations. While this model is significantly more accurate, it is also computationally more expensive. To speed up computations, the micro-macro method may be used. The micro-macro method switches between two models of varying levels of detail allowing for larger stable time steps. In this paper we formulate the micro-macro method for shallow water moment equations. We perform a theoretical runtime analysis of the method and present a series of results for a dam break test and a wave transport test. The micro-macro method achieves a significant speed-up while retaining a sufficient level of accuracy.

Abstract: We examine the linear stability of a shear flow driven by wind stress at the free surface and rotation at the lower boundary, mimicking oceanic flows influenced by surface winds and rotation of Earth. The linearised eigenvalue problem is solved using the Chebyshev spectral collocation method and a longwave asymptotic analysis. Our results reveal new longwave instability modes that emerge for non-zero rotational Reynolds numbers. It is observed that the most unstable mode, characterised by the lowest critical parameters, corresponds to longwave spanwise disturbances with vanishing streamwise wavenumber. The asymptotic analysis, which shows excellent agreement with numerical results, analytically confirms the existence of this instability. Thus, the present study demonstrates the hitherto unreported combined influence of wind stress and rotation of Earth on ocean dynamics.

Abstract: Turbulent reacting flows confined to ducts are plagued by thermoacoustic instability, a state in which a positive feedback between flow, flame and acoustic perturbations leads to the emergence of catastrophically high-amplitude oscillatory dynamics in the sound and global heat release rate fluctuations. Modeling the interdependence between local interactions and the global emergence of order in such spatially extended complex systems is exacting. Here, we present a novel reduced-order model to capture the influence of the local interactions on the variables exhibiting global emergence of order in a turbulent reacting flow system. We represent each variable that exhibits global oscillatory instability as an oscillator with a cubic nonlinearity. The oscillator is driven by a forcing term that represents the holistic influence of the inter-subsystem interactions on the global behavior. The forcing term essentially couples the local interactions and the globally emergent dynamics in the model. Further, the influence of the inter-subsystem interactions on the behavior of each subsystem is different. Therefore, we use different forcing terms for each variable inspired by the physical interactions in the system. The nonlinear oscillators representing the acoustic and the heat release rate oscillations are hence forced using Wiener and Markov-modulated Poisson processes, respectively. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce (i) the multifractal characteristics of acoustic pressure fluctuations during chaotic dynamics, (ii) the loss of multifractality through the experimentally observed scaling law behavior during the transition from chaos to order and (iii) the emergence of periodicity and bifurcation in heat release rate dynamics.

Abstract: Data-driven methods have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities in fluid mechanics, yet most current applications still focus on simplified configurations, often characterised by statistical stationarity or limited temporal variability. This work proposes a methodology that combines Data Assimilation (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict flow configurations that exhibit cyclic behaviour over time. Starting from limited, sparse high-fidelity measurements and a low-fidelity numerical model, the DA approach performs data fusion to obtain complete and accurate flow state estimations in time. This complete dataset is used to train multiple ML tools, which are applied across different phases of the flow cycle to augment the model's predictions when high-fidelity data might not be available for the DA application. The methodology is applied to the analysis of an oscillating cylinder in a laminar regime using a sliding-window approach, in which separate models are trained for specific flow conditions to ensure each model specialises in flow dynamics representative of a phase of the oscillation period. This phase-resolved learning enables the efficient capture of transient features that would be challenging for a single global model. The results highlight the potential of this method to study complex flow configurations with oscillatory features in which neither the flow nor the cycle is known a priori, in particular by exploiting real-time training and updates, as is commonly done in digital twins, which require continuous model correction and adaptation.

Abstract: Spiky oscillations are characterized by slow-fast dynamics and are observed in excitable media such as neuronal membranes and cardiac cells. In a turbulent reactive flow system, we observe that the heat release rate exhibits self-sustained periodic, spiky oscillations in synchrony with the sinusoidal periodic acoustic pressure oscillations. These self-sustained oscillations are a consequence of thermoacoustic instability, which arises due to a positive feedback between the acoustic and the heat release rate fields. One of the primary mechanisms for fluctuations in the heat release rate is the modulation in the topology of the flame, a thin interface separating the reactants and products. In this work, we explore the dynamics of the space-filling nature of the flame, quantified by its fractal dimension in relation to the spiky heat release rate oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system. We discover that the periodic oscillatory dynamics in the space-filling nature of the flame lead to periodic, spiky heat release rate oscillations. Based on this result, we show that the spiky oscillations in the heat release rate can be approximated as $e^{\mathrm{sin}(ωt)}$ during the dynamical state of generalized synchronization between the heat release rate and the acoustic pressure oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system. In synchronization theory, generalized synchronization is characterized by an emergent functional relationship, $Φ$, between the interacting subsystems. We unravel this emergent functional relation between the heat release rate and the acoustic pressure oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system. It is intriguing that the dynamics of a far-from-equilibrium complex system can be represented by such simple mathematical relations.

Abstract: Data-driven subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling in the large-eddy simulations (LES) suffers from the inconsistency between the \textit{a priori} tests and the a posteriori tests, which make training accurate SGS models a difficult task. We study the difference in filtered high-fidelity data and LES to identify the numerical deviation between the two cases, which is a combined impact of commutation error, numerical errors, and error coupling. The impact of the numerical deviation is examined through two SGS model formulations: the eddy-viscosity and the complex nonlinear models. By incorporating numerical deviations into model training, we enhance consistency, stabilize simulations, and improve predictions of energy spectra in a posteriori tests. Our findings highlight that data-driven methods introduce significant nonlinearity and equation coupling, exacerbating inconsistencies compared to non-data-driven approaches. Finally, while the impact of the numerical deviation can be generalized, achieving accurate model predictions necessitates a physically grounded model form and an optimal filter width.

Abstract: Classical Eulerian vortex criteria, such as the $Q$-, $Δ$-, $λ_2$-, $λ_{ci}$-, and Okubo--Weiss criterion, depend on frame-dependent quantities and therefore fail to provide objective, observer-independent diagnostics in unsteady frames. In this work, we address this longstanding limitation by introducing an objective variant of the $Q$-criterion, derived from a spatio-temporal variational principle that minimizes a modified time-derivative of the strain-rate tensor. Although several objective variants of the $Q$-criterion have been proposed before, none of these has successfully reconciled Eulerian diagnostics with the underlying Lagrangian motion of fluid particles, even in simple analytical solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we present the first vortex criterion that consistently resolves all known pathological examples leading to false positives and false negatives in Eulerian vortex criteria applied to unsteady flows. The results establish a unified and objective framework for Eulerian vortex detection, opening new directions for the analysis and control of unsteady flow phenomena.

Motivation: 理解倾斜层对流系统中在特定参数(γ=100°, Ra=10000)下观察到的复杂时空模式——切换钻石窗格(SDP)的形成机制，该模式是Pr=1.07时的五种复杂三级模式之一。

Abstract: In the inclined layer convection system, thermal convection in a Rayleigh--Bénard cell tilted against gravity, the flow is subject to competing buoyancy and shear forces. For varying inclination angle ($γ$) and Rayleigh number ($Ra$), a variety of spatio-temporal patterns is observed. We investigate the switching diamond panes (SDP) pattern, observed at $(γ, Ra)\simeq(100\degree,10000)$, which exhibits large-scale oblique features and is one of the five complex tertiary patterns at Prandtl number $Pr=1.07$. First, we study the linear instability of the secondary-state transverse convection rolls and the five branches including two travelling waves and three periodic orbits, bifurcating simultaneously from it. These non-generic bifurcations arise from the breaking of the spatial $D_4$ and $O(2)$ symmetries of transverse rolls, and the resulting bifurcated solutions show large-scale diamond-shaped amplitude modulations. Second, we explore a periodic orbit that captures both the large-scale structure and small-scale defects of modulated rolls. Parametric continuation in $Ra$ reveals the global homoclinic bifurcation via which this periodic orbit emerges. Third, the boundary of the basins of attraction of two dynamically relevant periodic orbits has been characterised. Specifically, additional steady and time-periodic solutions are identified on the basin boundary and their bifurcation structures are analysed. Together, using non-linear invariant solutions and their bifurcations, we take a further step toward understanding the emergence and dynamics of SDP far from the onset of convection, where linear methods have not been applied successfully.

Abstract: Biomimetic design principles, inspired by the structure of alligator osteoderms, are employed to provide innovative solutions for enhancing membrane distillation system performance. A novel spacer design for membrane distillation (MD) systems is introduced, incorporating the unique structural features of these natural formations. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to investigate nine new spacer configurations, with particular emphasis placed on enhancing mixing efficiency within the feed channel, which serves as the primary focus of this research. Results demonstrate that the novel spacer configurations exhibit superior performance, achieving up to a fivefold increase in mixing efficiency relative to the baseline of an empty channel. Furthermore, the new spacers are assessed and contrasted with two types of conventional spacers and the empty channel configuration with respect to pressure drop, thermal performance, and mass transfer properties.

Abstract: Through a massive computation we reached the fourth superharmonic instability branch of the Stokes' wave. Using the obtained results we checked phenomenological formulae for the dependence of the instability growth rates corresponding to different branches of instability on the nonlinearity parameter (steepness, defined as the wave swing to wavelength ratio $H/Λ$) in the vicinity of the new instability branch appearance and far from it. It is demonstrated, that the formulae, the one obtained as a least squares fit using the information from the first three branches of instability and a phenomenological asymptotics, work for the fourth branch and previously reported branches as well. Range of applicability of the relations was corrected. Growth rates for all four instability branches are reported.

Abstract: We present a general-purpose wall model for large-eddy simulation. The model builds on the building-block flow principle, leveraging essential physics from simple flows to train a generalizable model applicable across complex geometries and flow conditions. The model addresses key limitations of traditional equilibrium wall models (EQWM) and improves upon shortcomings of earlier building-block-based approaches. The model comprises four components: (i) a baseline wall model, (ii) an error model, (iii) a classifier, and (iv) a confidence score. The baseline model predicts the wall-shear stress, while the error model estimates epistemic errors and aleatoric errors, both used for uncertainty quantification. In Part I of this work, we present the baseline model, while the remaining three components are introduced in Part II. The baseline model is designed to capture a broad range of flow phenomena, including turbulence over curved walls and zero, adverse, and favorable mean pressure gradients, as well as flow separation and laminar flow. The problem is formulated as a regression task to predict wall shear stress using a neural network. Model inputs are localized in space and dimensionless, with their selection guided by information-theoretic criteria. Training data include, among other cases, a newly generated direct numerical simulation dataset of turbulent boundary layers under favorable and adverse PG conditions. Validation is carried out through both a priori and a posteriori tests. The a priori evaluation spans 140 diverse high-fidelity numerical datasets and experiments (67 training cases included), covering turbulent boundary layers, airfoils, Gaussian bumps, and full aircraft geometries, among others. We demonstrate that the baseline wall model outperforms the EQWM in 90% of test scenarios, while maintaining errors below 20% for 98% of the cases.
