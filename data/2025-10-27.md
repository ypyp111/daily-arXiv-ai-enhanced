### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练中为混淆因素建立捷径，防止目标属性与偶然因素的纠缠，从而提高生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的适配器训练方法容易将目标属性（如身份）与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性限制了泛化能力并阻碍模型遵循输入文本提示。

Method: 在适配器训练期间，通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为混淆因素建立捷径，消除适配器内部化这些因素的动机，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法显著提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解耦表示的最有效路径可能是为不应学习的内容建立捷径，这成为一个通用的设计原则。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 是一种新的视频生成范式，通过将参考视频作为语义提示来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制，在开源方法中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化的语义控制这一关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: VAP 将问题重新定义为上下文生成，使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过即插即用的混合变换器专家来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，并采用时间偏置位置嵌入来消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP 在开源方法中达到最先进水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美，并具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: VAP 在统一可控视频生成方面取得了显著进展，支持各种下游应用，推动了通用可控视频生成的发展。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，通过焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，提升医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕捉全局上下文信息和长距离依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和多种尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: 结合卷积和Transformer组件，使用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度表示的高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越现有最先进方法，证明了其有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer的优势，有效解决了医学图像分割中的全局上下文捕捉和边界精度问题，在多种医学成像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪方面达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式模型在不确定性情况下只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态轨迹，限制了在遮挡和外观变化等视觉模糊情况下的跟踪能力

Method: 采用流匹配公式，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代优化、跨窗口一致性的窗口相关先验，以及专门为点坐标调整的方差调度

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，在遮挡点跟踪精度上达到最先进水平，在可见点跟踪上保持竞争力

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪性能，同时保持可见点跟踪的竞争力

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [5] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这与临床诊断工作流程不匹配，限制了临床医生与AI的信任合作。

Method: 从7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积中提取494k个五元组，每个包含：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤、结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，为定位和诊断准确性提供基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的资源库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法依赖光照和材料特性，存在局限性。热偏振成像不受这些因素影响，能够重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，利用长波红外偏振成像消除模糊性，通过多视角热偏振图像恢复详细3D形状。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了独立于光照和材料的新途径，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的无监督域适应方法，通过多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调，使视觉基础模型能够适应新领域而无需标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺领域表现不佳的问题，传统监督微调在这种情况下不可行，而现有的自监督学习方法对视觉编码器模型效果有限。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行训练，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的综合实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA提供了一种有效的无监督域适应方法，能够利用多视角物体观察学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可提升模型性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化插件式流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D位姿估计流程在复杂工业环境下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决在杂乱、光照差和复杂背景等挑战条件下的检测问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的基础模型引导的背景去除，抑制SAM原始输出中的误报，为下游位姿估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升检测准确性的同时保持了实用性，证明了所提方法的有效性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用深度学习自动检测地震后混凝土结构中暴露的钢筋，通过YOLOv11模型识别裂缝、剥落和钢筋暴露，建立混合框架评估结构损伤等级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，需要自动检测暴露钢筋来评估结构损伤程度。

Method: 基于深度学习框架，使用YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋，通过微调、数据增强和公开数据集测试，建立自动分类和损伤等级评估的混合框架。

Result: 开发了能够自动识别建筑物内外和结构组件，检测损伤特征，并可靠确定损伤等级的自动化系统。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤情境下实现快速自动化的灾后损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视角、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D空间几何接地，这些限制阻碍了在具身智能场景中的应用。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间。节点包含开放词汇对象特征、3D位置和语义上下文，边捕捉空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本的3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一个新颖的语义分割解码器架构，通过联合优化空间域和小波域的特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在保持语义完整性的同时增强高频结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义分割网络大多采用强大的预训练编码器但使用简单的解码器，导致语义上下文和细粒度细节保存之间的权衡不佳。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器架构：1）从输入图像学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）应用双域操作（DDO）进行多尺度融合；3）提出频谱分解注意力（SDA）块，利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模增强高频结构细节；4）应用重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合集成多尺度特征和边界感知表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都持续优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过小波域频率先验与基于Mamba的注意力机制，能够有效平衡语义上下文和细节保存，为语义分割任务提供了高效精确的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念的视觉-语言模型框架，用于Hirschsprung病肠神经丛分类，通过整合医学知识提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在肠神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要将专家知识融入模型以提高临床相关性。

Method: 使用基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉-语言模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（医学教科书和论文），通过LLM生成提示并经团队审核后使用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 模型在各项分类指标上优于CNN模型（VGG-19、ResNet-18、ResNet-50），准确率达到83.9%，精确率86.6%，特异性87.6%。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识能产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），用于快速低光照图像增强，通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，显著提升了处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Retinex的低光照图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 定义直方图位置矩阵和直方图计数矩阵，建立光照、反射率和低光照图像直方图之间的关系，构建两级优化模型，通过求解优化模型得到光照和反射率直方图的迭代公式，最后通过直方图匹配增强图像。

Result: HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上均优于现有增强方法，在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒执行时间，相比其他方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: HistRetinex模型在保持增强质量的同时显著提升了处理速度，为低光照图像增强提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the

TL;DR: 提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，需要智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并进行动态决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要在静态、完全可观察环境中进行视觉推理，而现实世界信息往往不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够主动获取和整合信息的智能体。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR基准测试和AVR-152k数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在马尔可夫决策过程中实现不确定性识别、信息增益预测和动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、OpenEQA、RoboVQA等基准测试中达到最先进性能。分析发现当前MLLM虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在主动获取和整合信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是MLLM发展的关键方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体通过交互主动获取和整合信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向城市级LiDAR的对象中心、不确定性感知变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP对齐，结合语义分割和实例关联，在保持类别一致性的同时处理分裂合并情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DSM差异和基于图像的方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视角失配敏感，且缺乏对象身份信息；基于点的神经模型和体素编码需要大量内存，假设完美预对齐，难以处理薄结构，且很少强制类别一致关联。

Method: 使用多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP对齐时期，归一化高度，从配准协方差和表面粗糙度推导检测水平；几何代理种子跨时期关联，通过语义和实例分割以及类别约束二分分配进行细化，处理分裂合并。

Result: 在15个Subiaco区块上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，比Triplet KPConv在准确率上提高0.2个百分点，mF1提高0.2，mIoU提高0.8，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提高7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市级LiDAR变化检测中表现出色，特别是在处理分裂合并情况和部分重叠时保持稳定，通过不确定性感知和类别一致性约束提高了检测性能。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模基础模型为下游分割任务提供强大特征表示，但全参数微调计算开销大。现有方法通过嵌入可训练提示进行微调，但这些提示缺乏语义先验，限制了模型的适应性。

Method: 构建轻量级动态混合局部先验提取器，通过异构卷积从输入图像捕获多样局部先验，使用门控网络动态输出专家先验；设计双向交互适配器，采用余弦对齐可变形注意力和通道导向自适应尺度增强，在冻结和可训练特征间交互重组。

Result: 在31个最先进方法对比中表现出优越的分割性能，能够适应多个二值对象分割任务。

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态先验调制实现了高效微调，在保持高性能的同时显著减少了可训练参数数量。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标签粗糙模糊，无法区分导致安全问题的具体特征。需要系统方法来识别图像中哪些细微变化会影响安全性。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型生成反事实图像对，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征来翻转安全标签，同时保持其他无关细节不变。

Result: 构建了包含3020对图像的基准数据集，涵盖9个安全类别。该框架能有效评估视觉语言模型的弱点，并作为数据增强策略提高轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全差异的资源，为理解和改进图像安全分类提供了新方法。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用思维链推理能力时，难以在训练分布之外实现良好泛化。

Method: 1) 噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中添加高斯噪声以鼓励更广泛的视觉场景探索；2) 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推理问题，结合噪声水平和轨迹奖励计算稳健的后验优势估计。

Result: 在标准思维链质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提升了泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模多模态大语言模型上效果明显。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的多模态强化学习框架，有效解决了现有方法泛化能力不足的问题，为提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CT肺动脉造影，旨在减少对碘对比剂的依赖和相关风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT肺动脉造影是诊断肺血管疾病的金标准，但依赖碘对比剂会带来肾毒性和过敏反应等风险，特别是在高危患者中。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CT肺动脉造影图像。研究使用了410对CTPA和NCCT扫描，分为训练验证集和测试集。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集MAE:156.28，PSNR:20.71，SSIM:0.98；测试集MAE:165.12，PSNR:20.27，SSIM:0.98），在肺血管分割和血管量化任务中均显著优于NCCT输入。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效增强血管结构，特别是小血管，为减少对比剂使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

TL;DR: 提出了空间智能网格(SIG)来显式编码物体布局和空间关系，作为文本的补充通道，用于评估和提升基础模型的空间智能能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉空间智能的方法主要依赖文本提示和VQA评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，并且难以归因于真正的空间技能。

Method: 开发了结构化、基于网格的SIG模式，编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理先验。基于SIG构建评估指标，量化模型的内在视觉空间智能。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比纯VQA表示在所有VSI指标上都获得了更一致、更稳定和更全面的提升。

Conclusion: SIG有潜力作为数据标注和训练模式来学习视觉空间智能，同时发布了包含1.4K驾驶帧的SIGBench基准数据集。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM)框架，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段，每个段由专门的较小速度块建模，提高推理效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用分块设计，每个速度块专门处理特定时间区间；引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块基于预训练表示进行条件生成；提出轻量级特征残差近似策略降低推理成本。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，BFM相比现有Flow Matching方法在保持相似生成性能的同时，实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速。

Conclusion: BFM框架通过分块专业化设计和语义特征引导，显著提升了Flow Matching方法的效率-质量权衡，建立了更好的Pareto前沿。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个针对异常检测的token-wise适配框架，通过动态对齐视觉和可学习文本空间来实现细粒度异常学习，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐不同对象和领域视觉语义的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种不加区分的对齐阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 将token-agnostic文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，基于语义亲和力动态分配每个token到子空间组合；将动态对齐建模为最优传输问题，通过OT约束确保子空间间的充分优化；应用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划，使子空间专注于不同视觉区域。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过token-wise的动态视觉-文本空间对齐，实现了更精细的异常检测，在零样本设置下表现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Result: 实验表明KBE能缓解数据污染和饱和问题，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了动态、可控的评估方案，解决了静态基准的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: iSM框架使捷径模型成为可行且具有竞争力的生成模型类别，解决了长期存在的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新方法，用于生成高质量的艺术风格3D网格，通过并行生成实现高效控制，支持高达10,000个面和1024^3空间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高精度令牌预测并支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过同时观察所有网格令牌来提升效率和可控性。

Method: 采用解耦训练和混合推理，将生成过程分为拓扑雕刻和形状细化两个阶段；改进的沙漏架构结合双向注意力和旋转位置嵌入；引入连接损失作为拓扑约束。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的实验表明，TSSR能够生成高质量的3D艺术风格网格，达到10,000个面和1024^3的空间分辨率。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成中实现了高效率和高质量，为艺术风格3D内容创作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅技术升级为可执行的、语义和物理对齐的环境，包含对象中心语义标注和物理感知执行连接两个组件，并发布了InteriorGS数据集和SAGE-Bench基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，无法满足视觉语言导航的需求。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D方法，包括：(1) 对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度注释；(2) 物理感知执行连接，在3DGS中嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench（含2M VLN数据）。3DGS场景数据更难收敛但表现出强泛化能力，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

TL;DR: FineRS是一个两阶段的多模态大语言模型强化学习框架，用于在高分辨率场景中联合推理和分割极小的物体。它采用从粗到精的流程，包括全局语义探索和局部感知细化，通过定位引导的回顾奖励耦合两个阶段。

Motivation: 由于输入分辨率受限，多模态大语言模型在理解高分辨率图像中的视觉细节和定位极小物体方面面临挑战，特别是在杂乱背景中。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 全局语义探索进行指令引导推理生成文本响应和粗略目标区域；2) 局部感知细化将该区域细化为精确边界框和分割掩码。通过定位引导的回顾奖励耦合两个阶段。

Result: 在FineRS-4k和公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上持续优于最先进的多模态大语言模型方法。

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中处理极小物体的挑战，通过两阶段强化学习方法实现了更好的分割和推理性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的多模态对齐组件可解释性不足，难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一概念集。

Method: 使用基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定解码器构建VL-SAE，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLMs上的实验表明，VL-SAE能够有效解释和增强视觉语言对齐，在下游任务中提升零样本图像分类性能并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过概念级对齐提供了解释和增强视觉语言表示对齐的有效方法，为多模态模型的可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN学习紧凑3D表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能预测下游信号活动、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动的形态动力学转变。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟连接形态、扰动和功能，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Motivation: 传统多尺度特征融合方法在复杂果园环境中难以应对苹果叶片病害的表型异质性，特别是病变形态和分布的多样性问题，需要更好地处理局部与全局特征之间的关系。

Method: 采用多分支识别框架：CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系，自适应特征融合模块（AFFM）动态融合特征，并利用预训练CLIP权重实现图像-文本多模态学习。

Result: 在公开苹果病害数据集和自建数据集上分别达到97.38%和96.12%的准确率，优于多个基线方法，在复杂环境条件下显著提升识别精度。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为在现实场景中使用人类注视来增强VLM的预测能力奠定了基础，可应用于辅助机器人和人机协作等领域。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合像素级L1损失和基于SAM与TotalSegmentator的感知损失IMPACT-Synth。评估了两种配准策略：Elastix和IMPACT，发现IMPACT能提供更准确的解剖结构对齐，但在验证集上Elastix配准的数据训练模型得分更高，反映了配准偏差对评估的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练解剖区域并微调。损失函数结合L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。采用AdamW优化器，基于patch的训练，测试时使用数据增强和五折集成。评估两种配准策略：Elastix和IMPACT。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了更准确和解剖一致的配准，产生改进的sCT合成，具有更低的MAE和更真实的解剖结构。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据训练的模型得分更高。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价夸大性能指标。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致的配准有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定步数的去噪过程，不考虑下游传输限制。在实际云到设备场景中，有限带宽通常需要重度压缩，导致精细纹理丢失和计算浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，扩散模型以从可用带宽推导的目标质量水平为条件。模型学习自适应调制去噪过程，利用轻量级质量嵌入指导去噪轨迹，实现早期停止采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比简单的早期停止方法显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，只需最小的架构修改。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Conclusion: TerraGen展示了在完整数据和少样本场景下的强大跨任务泛化能力，为遥感视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提出的深度一致性约束无缝图像拼接方法能够有效解决视差引起的对齐问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Result: 评估了3个SOTA视频检索模型、6个基于图像的VLM和10个MLLM，揭示了现有方法在处理未剪辑视频和多模态查询方面的局限性，以及MLLM在多视频理解和重排序方面的不足。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

### [40] [Bridging the gap to real-world language-grounded visual concept learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21412)
*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的视觉概念学习框架，能够自适应识别图像相关概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念定位，无需预定义概念类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的视觉概念学习方法局限于少数预定义概念轴（如颜色、形状），且通常在合成数据集上探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化图像相关轴；通过通用概念编码器自适应绑定视觉特征到发现的轴；优化组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了卓越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样化而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念，并表现出强大的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法中表现优异，为视觉概念学习提供了可扩展且无需预定义的解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/whieya/Language-grounded-VCL.

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，能够合成具有精细几何结构、准确关节连接和逼真外观的人造3D物体。该方法通过变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间，并使用潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合成具有关节结构的3D物体时，难以同时保证几何一致性、关节准确性和外观逼真度，特别是在处理关节相关的可见性变化时存在挑战。

Method: 1) 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间；2) 在潜在空间上训练扩散模型进行多样化采样；3) 引入关节感知的高斯解码器，考虑关节相关的可见性变化；4) 基于关节状态调节外观解码，为通常被遮挡的区域分配合理的纹理特征。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法，能够生成视觉上更逼真的关节3D物体。

Conclusion: ArtiLatent为关节3D物体的合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理关节相关的可见性变化，显著提升视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [42] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种各向异性池化方法来改进基于查找表（LUT）的CNN图像恢复方法，替代传统平均池化，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LUT的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 引入广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化方法能够有效提升基于LUT的CNN图像恢复方法的性能，是平均池化的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

*Lisa Weijler,Sebastian Koch,Fabio Poiesi,Timo Ropinski,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在推理时间和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的显式建模层次结构的方法存在显著限制：要么需要多次渲染来捕获不同粒度的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭集离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样和细微结构的泛化能力差。

Method: OpenHype使用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，利用双曲几何的特性自然编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 该方法在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面展现出卓越的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲几何成功解决了3D对象和场景层次结构建模的挑战，为自主代理提供了更全面的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: PhysWorld通过模拟器合成物理可信的多样化演示数据，有效解决了数据稀缺问题，实现了高效准确的变形物体动态预测，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆的在线评分队列方案MoniTor，用于无需训练的视频异常检测，通过结合预训练视觉语言模型和LSTM启发机制来有效捕获时间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频异常检测由于实时约束和计算强度而很少受到关注，而现有的离线方法无法满足实时监控需求。

Method: 使用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM启发的预测机制捕获时间依赖，设计评分队列和异常先验动态存储最近分数。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上评估，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且无需训练即可与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了有效的无需训练解决方案，在实时监控场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice是一个新的视频修复框架，通过解耦视频修复为两个子任务：多帧一致性图像修复和掩码区域运动传播，引入间隔帧先验来指导修复过程，提升时空稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块在帧复制后编码一致先验，将拼接视频注入I2V生成主干。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多样视频修复场景中达到竞争性性能，显著改善前景对齐和运动稳定性。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦方法和间隔帧先验，有效解决了现有视频修复方法在时空稳定性方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC是一个基于语言的可解释胸部X光分类框架，通过任务对齐模式发现解决深度学习模型的黑盒问题，在保持诊断准确性的同时提供透明解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中准确性高，但由于黑盒特性难以获得临床信任。临床医生需要透明可验证的解释来信任自动诊断并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 训练基于transcoder的稀疏自编码器，在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上分解医学图像表示为可解释视觉模式。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个transcoder集成，发现约5000个单语义模式。

Result: 发现涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别的约5000个单语义模式，每个模式在共享特定放射学特征的图像中表现一致激活行为。在五个关键发现上实现竞争性诊断准确性。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明医学AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署，关键创新在于从针对特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型虽然表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚。本研究旨在理解注意力头如何专门处理特定语义或视觉属性，为模型解释和控制提供工具。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，从信号处理角度重新解释通过最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，系统分析多个样本并基于与目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态Transformer中都发现了头部级别的专业化模式。仅编辑1%的头部就能可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念，在问答、毒性缓解、图像分类和描述等任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: 注意力层内存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，所提方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

### [53] [Towards a Golden Classifier-Free Guidance Path via Foresight Fixed Point Iterations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21512)
*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，并引入了前瞻引导(FSG)方法，该方法在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题，在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并改进无分类器引导(CFG)的操作机制是文本到图像扩散模型研究的核心焦点。现有方法源于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择。

Method: 提出统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，寻找潜在空间中的黄金路径。引入前瞻引导(FSG)，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新颖视角，并释放了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的跨注意力桥接，实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型优势的同时，实现高效的多模态同步。

Method: 在冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型基础上，插入紧凑的视频跨注意力层，连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入。视频token经过池化后用于调节音频生成时序。

Result: 在视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现有竞争力，参数量远少于现有系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和模块化特性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、模块化的视频到Foley生成方案，桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态如语音生成。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，通过将优化范式从步骤级转移到块级来解决GRPO在文本到图像生成中的优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出强大潜力，但面临两个关键限制：不准确的优势归因和忽视生成的时序动态。

Method: 将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'，捕捉流匹配的内在时序动态，并在块级优化策略。还引入了可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 广泛实验表明，ChunkGRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优异结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展示了良好的前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

### [56] [MATrack: Efficient Multiscale Adaptive Tracker for Real-Time Nighttime UAV Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21586)
*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专为夜间无人机跟踪设计的系统，通过多尺度层次混合、自适应关键令牌门和夜间模板校准器三个核心模块，解决了夜间跟踪中的特征一致性、复杂背景识别和长时间序列稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态物体信息等问题。

Method: 提出MATrack系统，包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次混合器增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性；自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息；夜间模板校准器确保长时间序列的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。真实无人机平台测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救、边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段超分辨率框架，通过'文本优先、图像后处理'范式，将字形恢复与图像增强解耦，在提升图像质量的同时保持文本可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用这些结构指导后续的全图像超分辨率，实现字形到图像的引导。

Result: TIGER在UltraZoom-ST数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提升了文本可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦文本和图像处理，成功打破了图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出两种深度学习模型（ANN和CNN）用于自动检测MEG记录中的发作间期癫痫尖波，在仅有单专家标注的真实临床数据上表现优于现有方法，并采用交互式机器学习策略提高标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耐药性癫痫的术前评估中，MEG记录的发作间期癫痫尖波手动检测耗时且易出错，现有自动化方法要么需要大量标注数据，要么在非典型数据上缺乏鲁棒性，不适合临床实践。

Method: 提出基于特征的ANN和CNN两种模型架构，在59名患者数据库上训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量，并与现有最优模型进行比较。

Result: 两种模型在10个测试患者上均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式机器学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂且标注不完美的数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法为快速数据标注提供了潜力，所提模型是自动检测发作间期癫痫尖波的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性目标检测面临数据受限问题，像素级标注成本高昂，导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道生成超过139,000张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，通过迭代生成框架优先处理困难类别，并提出简化多掩码解码器处理检测中的模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能有效解决显著性目标检测中的数据受限问题，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑策略解决资源受限场景下模型过度自信和性能下降问题，在少量数据和计算资源下实现竞争性检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景中，大规模预训练模型（如CLIP）由于数据质量差或相关性弱而导致的过度自信和性能下降问题。

Method: 使用随机扰动引入可控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布，共同降低过度自信并提升噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的检索任务中优于现有方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就能达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: Modest-Align为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在处理几何一致性方面存在不足，存在几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影等问题。3D一致视频生成对下游生成和重建任务具有重要意义。

Method: 使用基于偏好的优化方法，通过成对极几何约束对齐扩散模型，直接解决相机轨迹不稳定和几何伪影问题，无需端到端可微分性。

Result: 经典几何约束比现代学习度量提供更稳定的优化信号，在静态场景动态相机训练下确保高质量测量，并能有效泛化到多样化动态内容。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种在不牺牲视觉质量的前提下生成空间一致视频的实用方法。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练规模有限，混合域预训练可能导致知识不对齐，影响下游任务性能。需要解决跨域数据整合与下游任务适配的问题。

Method: 设计异构域适配器（预训练时使用适应模式，微调时使用融合模式）和域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效整合跨域点云数据知识，通过域自适应机制提升下游任务性能，解决了混合域预训练中的知识对齐问题。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演化过程，导致知识传递效果不佳。

Method: 基于Gompertz曲线的阶段感知蒸馏策略，动态调整蒸馏损失权重；使用Wasserstein距离度量特征差异，梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为；多损失目标统一框架。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet50和MobileNet_v2等架构，相比传统蒸馏方法分别获得8%和4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过动态调整蒸馏过程，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，证明了考虑学生模型学习进程的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了长尾识别方法在野生动物物种识别中的应用，在NACTI数据集上实现了99.40%的Top-1准确率，显著优于95.51%的基线，并在领域偏移测试中展示了更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然世界数据收集中的严重长尾类别不平衡问题，NACTI数据集中最大的'Head'类别占整个语料库的50%以上。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究长尾识别方法，包括各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感正则化，构建了减少偏差的测试集来评估领域偏移。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40% Top-1准确率，比使用标准交叉熵的基线95.51%有显著提升；在领域偏移测试中达到52.55%准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强调度器选择在野生动物领域带来一致改进，特别是与最先进的LTR损失结合使用时，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决某些定量和定性缺陷，包括在严重领域偏移下尾部类别的灾难性崩溃。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统突触分类需要监督学习，但该方法旨在仅通过观察相邻突触相似性来分类，无需预先标注类别。

Method: 利用相邻突触比随机选择的突触更相似的原理，在果蝇数据上应用无监督分类方法。

Result: 成功在果蝇数据上实现了突触分类，无需预先知道类别数量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需预知类别数量的突触分类方式，并能帮助选择具有代表性的地面真实数据。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器在皮肤病理学全玻片图像分类中的性能，发现Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现更优，逻辑回归达到90%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，以支持皮肤病理学诊断。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略聚合成玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归对Virchow2达到最高准确率90%，但差异无统计学意义。均值聚合方法提供了可靠的玻片级特征表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化WSI分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为未来玻片级表示学习的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个分层框架，用于生成无限扩展的3D场景，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现几何一致和外观逼真的无界环境合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型多为物体中心，限制了场景级生成的应用。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：1)数据筛选管道提取高质量场景块用于训练；2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: WorldGrow具有构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Motivation: 解决生态学中因缺乏对黑盒神经网络模型的信任而导致的计算机视觉应用滞后问题，通过提供预测证据和记录部署限制来增强模型可信度。

Method: 使用Faster R-CNN检测冰川湾国家公园航拍图像中的海豹，并应用梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、LIME和基于扰动的解释方法生成解释。

Result: 解释集中在海豹躯干和轮廓而非周围环境，移除海豹会降低检测置信度，揭示了海豹与黑冰、岩石混淆等系统性错误源。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后处理可解释性相结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，开发出可审计的、支持决策的生态保护监测工具。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

TL;DR: BachVid是首个无需训练的方法，通过分析DiT注意力机制和中间特征，实现无需参考图像的多视频一致生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖参考图像或大量训练，且通常只解决角色一致性，背景一致性仍需图像到视频模型处理。

Method: 分析DiT注意力机制，发现其能在去噪过程中提取前景掩码和匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些变量注入新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果显示BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型作为几何求解器的潜力，解决长期存在的几何难题，如内接正方形问题，并扩展到其他复杂几何问题。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型从高斯噪声生成表示有效近似解的图像，通过图像生成实现几何推理。

Result: 模型能够将噪声几何结构转化为正确配置，成功解决了三个著名的困难几何问题，展示了扩散模型在几何问题求解中的有效性。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作提供了一个通用且实用的框架来近似困难问题，为处理更广泛类别的几何任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

Motivation: 许多高风险AI应用需要形成数据驱动的假设和针对性猜测，但在有限资源下，基于语言模型的代理是否能够理性行动尚不清楚。

Method: 引入协作战舰游戏任务，开发基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，用于提升观察员代理的准确性和船长代理的信息增益。

Result: 观察员代理准确率提升14.7%，船长代理信息增益提升0.227比特（达到噪声上限的94.2%），较弱模型击败人类（胜率从8%提升至82%）和前沿模型（胜率从0%提升至67%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在Guess Who?游戏中同样有效，证明了构建理性信息寻求代理的通用性。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少样本引导学习，使标准指令语言模型无需微调就能达到或超越对应推理模型的性能，同时显著提高token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行速度慢且成本高。研究发现标准指令语言模型本身已具备强大的推理能力，只需合适的引导方法即可激发。

Method: CodeAdapt方法结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在自然语言推理中穿插代码执行）和少样本引导学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现有效推理。

Result: 在四个匹配的语言模型-推理模型对中，CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均表现优于对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），token效率提高10-81%，在六个任务上四个模型平均表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt风格的学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，基于代码的语言模型是认知基础良好且强大的系统，可能为权重内强化学习提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 由于长文本细粒度标注成本高和公共领域文学数据污染问题，评估语言模型在计算文学研究中的实用性面临挑战，现有嵌入相似度数据集不适合文学领域任务。

Method: 构建FICSIM数据集，包含长篇现代小说，基于作者提供的元数据定义12个相似度维度，并通过数字人文学者验证，评估多种嵌入模型的表现。

Result: 评估显示各模型普遍倾向于关注表面特征，而非对计算文学研究有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集填补了文学领域评估的空白，揭示了当前模型在语义理解上的局限性，并在数据收集过程中优先考虑作者权益和知情同意。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的大型语言模型从美国最高法院案例中识别推翻关系的能力。

Result: 模型在历史案例上表现下降，依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解，在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个解决现实长上下文评估关键差距的基准，反映了实际法律推理任务的复杂性和重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Result: 人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有模型，平均准确率高16.6%。开源和闭源LLM之间存在18.1%的性能差距，最强模型(gpt-5)仅达到73.5%准确率，而人类为90.1%。人类和模型在爱尔兰语语法的不同方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 爱尔兰-BLiMP为评估LLM在爱尔兰语中的语法能力提供了首个系统性框架，为推进低资源语言的语言理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

Motivation: 思维链提示虽能提升复杂任务准确率，但会增加token使用量，且在某些任务中可能无效甚至有害。需要确定何时使用CoT才能平衡性能与效率。

Method: 提出置信度门控CoT，评估四种无需训练的置信度估计方法，与随机基线和知道何时需要CoT的oracle进行比较。

Result: 现有无需训练的置信度度量可以减少冗余CoT，优于随机调用CoT。但个体置信度度量的效用不一致，随数据集和模型变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前置信度门控CoT方法的潜力和局限性，为开发更可靠的自适应CoT门控方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

TL;DR: 该研究量化了输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛摘要中幻觉和事实错误的影响，发现JSON格式输入相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成的文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要研究如何减少幻觉和事实错误。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）测试两个LLM模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）生成NBA比赛摘要，人工标注了3,312个事实错误。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON输入相比非结构化输入，Llama错误率降低69%，Qwen降低65%；行结构输入分别降低54%和51%。方差分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入数据结构是影响LLM生成准确性的关键因素，结构化输入（特别是JSON格式）能显著减少事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了在低误报率(FPR)要求下，推理增强对LLM分类任务的影响，发现推理在提升整体准确率的同时，在严格精度要求场景下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理在精度敏感任务中的适用性，特别是在需要严格控制误报率的分类任务中，填补了现有研究空白。

Method: 在两个任务（安全检测和幻觉检测）上评估推理增强方法，比较Think On（推理增强）和Think Off（无推理）模式，使用标准LLM和大型推理模型(LRM)，分析基于token的评分与自述置信度的表现。

Result: 推理增强提升整体准确率但在低FPR阈值下表现不佳；无推理模式在精度敏感场景中占优；token评分优于自述置信度；两种模式的简单集成可结合各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和选择演示示例来改进上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，适用于黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前上下文知识编辑方法依赖静态演示集的问题，包括数量-质量权衡和缺乏对任务难度的适应性。

Method: 训练BERT检索器使用REINFORCE算法按编辑奖励对演示进行排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例，根据任务难度动态调整提示长度。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提升17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持对无关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，为黑盒LLM提供了有效的梯度免费编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语问答，通过问题复杂度分类器选择回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强，但多检索策略存在不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，本研究旨在解决印尼语等低资源语言在问答系统中的语言差距问题。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，包含问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强以弥补印尼语数据集的不足。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究显示了低资源语言问答的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能药物推荐系统发展中公开真实世界电子健康记录数据集稀缺的问题，特别是在非英语语言环境下，为中文临床药物推荐研究提供资源。

Method: 构建包含患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等全面信息的CDrugRed数据集，并基于该数据集对多种最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试，评估其在出院药物推荐任务上的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然监督微调能提升模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更鲁棒和准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

*Qingru Zhang,Liang Qiu,Ilgee Hong,Zhenghao Xu,Tianyi Liu,Shiyang Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Zheng Li,Lihong Li,Bing Yin,Chao Zhang,Jianshu Chen,Haoming Jiang,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过设计基于SFT模型和预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，实现无需人类偏好标注的在线策略微调，解决SFT的过拟合和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)作为对齐大语言模型的重要方法，存在过拟合和域外泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。传统SFT作为离线策略方法，难以有效利用演示数据。

Method: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法：1) 设计奖励函数作为SFT模型和预训练基础模型的对数策略比率；2) 将预训练策略作为基线，SFT策略作为目标；3) 结合PPO进行在线策略微调，无需人类偏好标注。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下，展现出更好的泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO通过结合SFT和PPO，利用自奖励机制有效解决了SFT的局限性，为使用演示数据对齐大语言模型提供了更有效的方法，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的场景。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了VeriGray基准，通过引入Out-Dependent类别来解决摘要忠实性评估中的标注模糊问题，发现即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有忠实性基准存在标注模糊问题，主要由于生成输出中允许使用外部知识的边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实性标注框架，引入Out-Dependent中间类别来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中约6%的句子存在幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊性对于忠实性检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色但缺乏结构化推理能力，而文本属性图提供显式关系结构但缺乏语义深度。两者的结合可以产生互补优势，增强图表示学习并提高LLM的推理和可解释性。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的分类法，包括两个基本方向：LLM用于TAG（LLM丰富基于图的任务）和TAG用于LLM（结构化图改进LLM推理）。将编排策略分类为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论了TAG特定的预训练、提示和参数高效微调的进展。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并突出了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等多样化应用中的成果。

Conclusion: 该综述为语言和图学习交叉领域的未来工作提供了指导，并概述了开放的挑战和有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: 论文发现LLM在模拟人类行为时存在理想化偏差，无法真实再现人类社交复杂性，而是呈现过度理想化的"乌托邦"社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的人类行为模拟对社会研究至关重要，但LLM在社交环境中与真实人类行为的差异程度尚不明确，存在科学误读和实际应用风险。

Method: 通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，从五个语言维度分析，建立系统框架来检验LLM的社会认知偏差。

Result: 实验发现LLM表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极性偏差，形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性的"乌托邦"社会。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具社会基础性的LLM，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Motivation: 爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试资源有限，缺乏对不同LLM在爱沙尼亚语任务上性能的全面比较评估。

Method: 创建基于7个多样化数据集的新基准，数据集来自爱沙尼亚语原生资源而非机器翻译，评估包括基础模型、开源指令调优模型和商业模型，采用人工评估和LLM作为评判者两种方法。

Result: 人工评估分数与基准评估呈现中等到高度相关性，Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为LLM评判者与人工评分高度一致。

Conclusion: 性能最佳的LLM可以有效支持爱沙尼亚语模型的评估工作。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Conclusion: 基于分类学的多智能体系统能够高保真地模拟多样化的临床调度场景，可用于调度员培训、协议评估和实时决策支持，为AI安全集成到应急响应工作流程提供了路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

### [91] [Correlation Dimension of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21258)
*Xin Du,Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用相关维度（一种分形几何度量）来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，该方法能揭示模型训练阶段、反映上下文依赖复杂性、指示幻觉倾向，并检测生成文本的退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言生成方面取得了显著进展，但仍表现出重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为，即使困惑度较低。这凸显了传统评估指标的局限性，这些指标强调局部预测准确性而忽略了长程结构复杂性。

Method: 引入相关维度这一分形几何度量来衡量文本的自相似性，捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中桥接局部和全局特性。该方法计算高效，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于自回归架构。

Result: 实验表明相关维度能够：(1)揭示预训练中的三个不同阶段；(2)反映上下文依赖复杂性；(3)指示模型的幻觉倾向；(4)可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 相关维度为理解大语言模型的生成动态提供了新的视角，是一种有效且通用的文本复杂性评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要由于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，特别是在长序列中，这为优化提供了机会。

Method: PBS-Attn利用注意力的置换特性，将序列分区成块，并跳过部分块的计算，通过自定义的permuted-FlashAttention内核实现。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界长上下文数据集上，PBS-Attn在模型准确性上始终优于现有的块稀疏注意力方法，并接近完整注意力基线，在长上下文预填充中实现了高达2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种实用可行的解决方案，能够有效提高长上下文LLM预填充的计算效率，同时保持模型准确性。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

### [93] [PARL: Prompt-based Agents for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21306)
*Yarik Menchaca Resendiz,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL是一种使用LLM作为强化学习代理的方法，通过提示而非微调，在非语言环境中进行结构化推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在语言任务中的表现，但缺乏对LLM在强化学习环境中作为智能体的评估，特别是在非语言结构化推理任务中。

Method: PARL方法通过提示将动作、状态和奖励编码给LLM，使其能够通过试错与环境交互进行学习，无需微调。

Result: 在简单环境中，PARL能够匹配或超越传统强化学习代理，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中存在性能限制。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为有效的强化学习代理，但当前方法在处理复杂数学运算和状态解码方面仍有局限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似度惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率，无需访问基础LLM的梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，传统方法需要大量昂贵的生成样本。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似度惩罚，结合重要性重加权和方差缩减技术来去偏和优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法达到或超越基线性能，用相同样本数量覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架可作为即插即用的增强工具，用于风险敏感模型部署中的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [95] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了NLP模型对字母乱序单词（typoglycemia）的鲁棒性，发现即使不同单词在乱序后变得相同，模型仍能保持良好性能，主要原因是英语中真正会混淆的单词对很少，且这些单词的上下文差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解为什么NLP模型在面对字母乱序的单词时仍能表现良好，特别是当不同单词（如form和from）在乱序后变成相同表示时，模型如何避免混淆。

Method: 研究方法包括：(i)分析英国国家语料库以量化单词在乱序下的混淆情况；(ii)评估BERT模型区分混淆形式的能力；(iii)通过对比在干净文本和乱序文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 研究结果显示，字母乱序导致的性能下降比预期要小，证实了英语中真正会混淆的单词对数量有限，且这些单词的上下文差异足够大，使得消歧变得简单。

Conclusion: 结论是NLP模型对字母乱序的鲁棒性主要源于英语语言本身的特性：混淆单词对较少，且这些单词的上下文差异明显，使得模型能够轻松进行消歧。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修改行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重性和旅行者容忍度等维度，评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能生成个性化行程，但无法有效应对现实旅行中的各种中断情况，需要评估LLM在这种动态环境下的适应能力。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1) 自动指标评估（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2) LLM作为评判者自动评估修订质量；3) 专家手动评估语义、空间、序列和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: LLM在序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，但空间偏差在短途旅行中较大，随着行程延长而减小。然而，随着行程长度增加，LLM处理中断的能力下降。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了LLM在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

*Qiang Liu,Wuganjing Song,Zhenzhou Lin,Feifan Chen,Qiaolong Cai,Chen Li,Yongduo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练在推理任务中比多轮训练更有效，单轮训练的模型能很好泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练反而会降低单轮推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多轮训练与人类反馈是否对推理任务必要，因为大语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，而实际应用涉及多轮交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮设置下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都表现良好，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练带来的收益有限甚至可能损害推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手工编写问答基准数据集，用于评估多语言模型在瑞典特定知识上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准大多是从美国基准翻译而来，不适合测试瑞典特有的相关知识。需要专门针对瑞典本地化内容的评估工具。

Method: 手工编写问答数据集，灵感来自瑞典文化媒体名人的广播节目和主要体育赛事，包含英语翻译以测试跨语言事实一致性。

Result: 发现具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当；继续在瑞典语上预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集可作为研究多语言模型中语言适应和知识保留的诊断工具，展示了其在语言适应研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的土耳其语大规模编码器模型，在多项NLP任务中表现优异，但研究发现当前土耳其语基准可能已饱和，且语料质量比数据量更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大规模预训练中代表性不足的问题，为土耳其语NLP提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科）从头训练RoBERTa基础的编码器模型，提供基础和大型两种配置。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现优异，大型变体在四个任务中的两个获得最佳分数，但整体没有一致的规模优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT作为土耳其语NLP的开放资源，同时作为实证案例研究，表明在形态丰富语言中语料组成比单纯数据规模更重要，当前土耳其语基准可能已饱和。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中有潜力，但在人类活动识别领域尚未充分探索，且缺乏评估其动态非确定性输出的方法。

Result: 实验表明，视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中达到与传统方法相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超越传统方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标，针对RAG系统中LLM处理文档的特点，改进了传统IR指标，显著提升了与答案准确性的相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类顺序阅读文档的假设，不适用于RAG系统中LLM整体处理文档的方式，且未考虑干扰文档对生成质量的负面影响

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，提出UDCG指标，采用LLM导向的位置折扣

Result: 在5个数据集和6个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标相关性提升高达36%

Conclusion: UDCG为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件性能

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上落后于自回归大语言模型，主要原因是去噪步骤中掩码token的独立生成无法捕捉token相关性。

Method: 使用多奖励优化方法，结合测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来直接优化token相关性，并引入组步和重要性采样策略来降低奖励方差和提高采样效率。

Result: MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准高表现的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 通过增强token相关性可以显著提升扩散语言模型的推理能力，MRO方法为扩散模型在推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 多参与者脑调优在神经科学和AI之间建立了双向获益，有助于弥合两个领域之间的差距。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available

Conclusion: 机制信号可作为RAG系统中高效、可泛化的幻觉检测预测指标，支持代理模型评估策略

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型是否对语言谱系结构敏感，发现存在属级效应但受训练资源可用性强烈影响，不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略。


<details>

Motivation: 探索语言谱系结构在大型语言模型多语言行为变化中的作用，特别是模型是否对语言属表现出敏感性。

Method: 扩展MultiQ数据集上的先前分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度未保持时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并调查知识一致性在属内是否比跨属更好保持。

Result: 属级效应存在但受训练资源可用性强烈影响，不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLM编码了属级结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着语言模型能力的提升，需要更挑战性的评估来超越表层语言能力，关注语用学——理解情境意义、语言和文化规范的能力。

Method: 创建了包含405个多项选择题的斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准测试，讨论了翻译困难，建立了人类基线，并对LLMs进行了试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达中隐含的说话者意义方面仍有困难，特别是文化特定表达。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准测试必须精心设计，最好基于本地数据构建，并通过人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位配列特征的无监督异常检测算法，应用于多语言Kokborok变体与Bangla的数据集。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法，虽然精确度和召回率因异常微妙而保持中等水平。

Conclusion: 高召回率方法为田野工作者提供了系统化标记需要验证条目的工具，支持低资源语言文档的数据质量改进。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过构建分析框架和证据评分机制，有效提升了LLMs在股票预测任务中的独立推理能力，减少上下文不当影响。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和测量之间建立了定量桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性洞见，并揭示了人工与人类认知的对齐关系。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: CESAR通过强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，通过奖励推理过程而非结果验证，实现了推理性能的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理过程存在测试时逆缩放现象，即更长的推理链反而导致性能下降，这源于缺乏对推理过程的适当训练指导。

Method: 提出CESAR框架，采用在线强化学习，使用Group Relative Policy优化和多方面奖励机制，激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上达到最先进水平，显著超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发稳健可扩展的音频LLM推理建立了原则性方法，增强的推理能力同时改善了多模态推理和感知能力。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

TL;DR: CRISP是一个基于图时空学习框架的金融时间序列预测模型，能够自适应学习危机期间资产相关性结构变化，通过注意力机制过滤噪声连接，实现跨危机机制的稳健预测和投资组合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的时空学习方法依赖预定义的图拓扑结构，无法适应不同危机机制下市场动态的变化，导致在信用危机、疫情冲击、通胀抛售等不同危机时期预测效果不佳。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力机制建模时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，注意力机制自动发现重要的资产关系。

Result: 在2005-2021数据上训练后，CRISP能稳健泛化到2022-2024通胀驱动市场，夏普比率达到3.76，比等权重基准提升707%，比静态图方法提升94%。注意力权重提供可解释的机制检测，危机期间防御性集群注意力增强49%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过自适应学习而非强加假设，能够发现危机相关的依赖关系，实现跨危机机制的稳健预测和投资组合分配，在危机期间保持盈利能力。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD是一种有效的多目标贝叶斯优化方法，能够生成高质量、多样化的帕累托最优解集。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Conclusion: 负学习范式能够稳定决策空间，保留模态特有信息，在多模态学习中具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Result: 重尾SGD能够找到几何形状更平坦的局部最小值，在测试数据上获得更好的泛化性能

Conclusion: 重尾SGD结合梯度裁剪可以显著改善深度学习模型的泛化能力，这一发现得到了仿真和深度学习实验的验证

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上进行广泛实验，证明所提方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 提出的区间目标回归方法通过兼容区间目标的损失函数和min-max学习框架，有效解决了精确目标不可得情况下的回归问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了将元学习应用于蛋白质突变性质预测的创新方法，通过MAML元学习和新型突变编码策略，显著提升了跨数据集泛化能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质突变预测方法依赖对特定数据集的微调，但在跨数据集泛化方面表现不佳，主要由于实验条件异质性和目标域数据有限。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了元学习在蛋白质突变分析中的系统性应用，并引入了有效的突变编码策略，为蛋白质工程中的跨域泛化提供了变革性方法。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LBS是一种新颖的概率框架，通过结合状态空间模型和大型语言模型，实现多模态时间序列预测，支持灵活的回顾和预测窗口，并提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界预测中需要整合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息的问题，现有方法在输入/输出视野固定、无法建模不确定性方面存在架构限制。

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型(SSM)骨干网络，捕捉潜在状态的时间动态；(2)预训练的大型语言模型(LLM)，用于编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测。

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将先前最先进方法的性能提升了13.20%，同时为每个预测提供人类可读的摘要。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时间推理提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用可逆性来防止强化学习训练过程中安全问题的模型无关方法，仅需查询黑盒动力学而无需显式安全约束知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型无关强化学习方法缺乏正式安全保证，现有方法通常依赖详细的安全规范知识，而许多难以明确规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征

Method: 使用模型预测路径积分控制来检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，基于可逆性概念防止不安全动作

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够在不依赖显式安全约束知识的情况下提供有效的安全保证

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论协议将辩论视为零和游戏，导致辩论黑客行为——辩论者倾向于误导法官而非寻求真相，这反而引入更多错误并表现不如单智能体方法。

Method: ColMAD协议鼓励多个智能体以支持性方式相互批评，相互补充遗漏点，使法官智能体能够基于更全面的证据做出更有信息量的结论。

Result: 实验表明ColMAD显著优于先前竞争性多智能体辩论方法19%，并在错误检测任务上相比单智能体方法带来非平凡改进。

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体辩论协议能有效缓解辩论黑客问题，通过非零和游戏框架提升大语言模型错误检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于向量copula理论的互信息估计方法，在模型复杂度和容量之间取得更好平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互信息估计方法要么依赖需要大量数据的复杂模型（如神经网络），要么使用过于简化的模型（如高斯copula）无法捕捉复杂分布

Method: 基于向量copula理论，在两种极端方法之间进行原则性插值

Result: 在先进合成基准测试和多种模态的真实世界数据上表现出优势

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂度和容量之间实现了更好的权衡

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了隐式神经表示（INRs）在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中的性能，发现INRs能实现高达230的压缩比，在压力和速度重建中误差很小，在解剖结构表示中平均误差低于0.5mm。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估隐式神经表示在特定领域应用中的准确性，特别是在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面的性能。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练的位置编码、非线性核的线性组合，在胸主动脉的血流动力学场和48个胸主动脉解剖结构上进行测试。

Result: INRs在胸主动脉血流动力学场中实现了约230的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差为1 mmHg，速度误差为5-10 cm/s；在解剖结构表示中平均绝对误差低于0.5mm，最大误差低于1.6mm。SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: 隐式神经表示在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面表现出色，具有高压缩比和低误差，是有效的表示方法。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于MOF材料设计的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习和语言理解，在材料性能预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在科学发现中的突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多元表示。MOF材料设计尤其困难，其三维原子排列和配位几何规则难以用语言表示，且依赖难以文本化的人类专业知识。

Method: L2M3OF整合晶体表示学习与语言理解，联合处理结构、文本和知识模态。使用预训练晶体编码器和轻量投影层将结构信息压缩到标记空间，与语言指令高效对齐。构建了结构-属性-知识数据库用于训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明，L2M3OF在性能预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等最先进的闭源文本LLM，且参数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Conclusion: 该方法代表了向实现高效设备端学习的重要一步，展示了在仅需几百kB RAM内存预算下进行有效微调的能力。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Motivation: 大语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，后训练量化可以降低这些需求，但标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著的性能下降。

Method: 使用分组格向量量化框架，为每组权重分配可学习的生成矩阵定义的格码本，采用Babai舍入法近似最近格点搜索来解决量化过程的不可微问题。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架在严格资源约束下部署大模型方面表现出有效性，推理时解码简化为简单的矩阵向量乘法，形成高效实用的量化流程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal

settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DD2方法，通过条件分数蒸馏损失训练一步生成器，显著提升图像自回归模型的一步采样性能，相比DD1将一步采样与原始AR模型的差距缩小67%，同时实现12.3倍训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型虽然性能优异，但采样步骤多导致生成速度慢。DD1方法虽然支持少步采样，但在一步采样设置下性能下降明显，且依赖预定义映射限制了灵活性。

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，在潜在嵌入空间的每个token位置提供真实条件分数。提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器，训练单独网络预测生成分布的条件分数，并在每个token位置应用分数蒸馏。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2使图像AR模型的一步采样FID从3.40增加到5.43，相比最强基线DD1，将一步采样与原始AR模型的差距缩小67%，同时实现12.3倍训练加速。

Conclusion: DD2在实现一步AR生成目标方面迈出了重要一步，为快速高质量的自回归建模开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Conclusion: 零阶优化是持续学习中有前景的方法，ZO-FC设计通过结合零阶优化的稳定性和一阶优化的适应性，为解决持续学习中的三难问题提供了有效的平衡方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Conclusion: 学习率选择与算法设计同等重要，对实现统计和计算效率至关重要。分层训练提供了一种无需修改损失函数就能超越相关性查询的新方法。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Conclusion: A-GPS是一个简单而强大的方法，能够高效学习帕累托集，灵活捕捉用户偏好，避免显式超体积计算，在多目标优化中具有良好应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

TL;DR: DictPFL是一个实用的联邦学习框架，通过分解模型权重为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密传输部分参数，实现全梯度保护的同时大幅降低计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于同态加密的联邦学习方法存在两极化问题：要么全加密带来过高开销，要么部分加密暴露隐私风险。需要一种既能保护所有传输梯度隐私，又保持实用性能的方法。

Method: 提出DePE模块将模型权重分解为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密传输查找表；PrME模块通过加密感知剪枝最小化加密参数数量。

Result: 相比全加密联邦学习，通信成本降低402-748倍，训练速度提升28-65倍；相比选择性加密方法，开销降低51-155倍，速度提升4-19倍。

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于同态加密的私有联邦学习在实际部署中具有可行性，其运行时间仅比明文联邦学习慢2倍以内。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

*Xiangyang Xu,Hongyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于基序驱动的全局-局部上下文图的少样本分子属性预测方法，通过引入化学基序节点构建三元异质图，在全局和局部层面丰富上下文信息，显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据，但在药物发现和材料科学中往往缺乏足够的标记数据。现有的少样本分子属性预测方法虽然通过上下文图引入关系归纳偏置，但分子-属性图提供的结构指导有限。

Method: 构建全局三元异质图（基序-分子-属性），引入化学有意义的基序节点捕获长程组合模式；同时为每个分子-属性对构建局部子图，分别编码以聚焦最相关的邻近分子和基序。

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试上的实验表明，该框架始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 将全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文相结合，能够有效推进鲁棒的少样本分子属性预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD方法，在信念近似精度和决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，现有POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂不确定性结构，导致估计错误和次优行为。

Method: 扩展SVGD，引入相关感知投影来建模状态维度间的依赖关系，以及时间一致性约束来稳定更新同时保持相关结构，保留SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为复杂高维信念空间提供了有效的表示方法。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特征收集成本高昂的场景中，需要选择有限特征来训练能在多个子群体上同时表现良好的模型。

Method: 使用连续松弛传统变量选择方法，通过噪声机制优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差，开发模型无关的框架。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够平衡跨子群体的下游预测性能，适用于特征收集成本高的应用场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarBoost提出了一种分布式光伏系统功率输出预测的新方法，通过将聚合功率建模为小电网输出的组合，解决了DPV系统面临的电网级数据缺失、容量动态变化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集中式光伏方法难以应用于分布式光伏系统，因为DPV面临电网级数据缺失、安装容量时间偏移、地理变异性和面板多样性等挑战。

Method: 将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，每个电网输出通过单位输出函数乘以其容量来建模，将同质单位输出函数与动态容量解耦以实现准确预测。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证了电网级建模的优越性，在中国多个城市部署验证，显著减少了潜在损失，为电网运行提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: SolarBoost通过创新的电网级建模方法，有效解决了分布式光伏系统功率预测的挑战，在实际部署中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗物联网对端到端延迟有严格要求，而顺序工作流在异构云-雾-边缘基础设施上的调度是一个NP难问题，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 采用两层DDPG框架：全局控制器选择处理层（边缘、雾或云），局部控制器在选定层内分配节点，共同优化工作流完成时间。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，随着工作流复杂度增加，相比基线方法表现出越来越优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，特别适用于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Conclusion: RL引导的生成扩散模型在推进自动化分子设计方面具有强大潜力，生成的候选分子显示出有前景的类药行为和结合稳定性

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过添加额外损失函数来引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，从而在期望奖励和不良输出概率之间实现更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，而专注于减少不良输出概率的方法通常以牺牲平均性能为代价。需要改进这种权衡关系。

Method: 在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间产生更好的权衡，并且比标准RL对齐方法和替代方法更具对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe提供了一种有效的方法来平衡语言模型对齐中的期望奖励和不良输出控制，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Method: 1. 重新推导k-means与矩阵分解的等价关系；2. 首次形式化模糊c-means的矩阵分解解释；3. 使用l1,2范数替代Frobenius范数构建鲁棒版本；4. 开发交替最小化算法和IRLS算法。

Result: 成功建立了统一的矩阵分解框架，将经典和鲁棒聚类统一起来。所有算法在理论上都被证明能够收敛到局部最小值。

Conclusion: 该框架为聚类分析提供了统一的数学基础，增强了聚类方法对异常值的鲁棒性，并为未来的聚类方法研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型遗忘方法，通过擦除和修复两个阶段来清除模型对敏感信息的记忆，无需昂贵的额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种高效的方法来清除这些记忆。

Method: SANI采用两阶段方法：1)重置模型最后几层的特定神经元以破坏细粒度信息记忆；2)在避免记忆敏感信息的情况下微调模型。

Result: 仅需少量遗忘训练轮次，模型就能被有效清理，信息泄露数量显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于医院等行业，可在共享模型前高效清理已训练模型中的敏感信息。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口属性上。

Method: 使用公平主成分分析将CLIP输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息的子空间，结合经验噪声注入和跨人口统一投影方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

TL;DR: GenReview是迄今为止最大的包含LLM生成评审意见的数据集，包含81K条针对ICLR 2018-2025年所有提交论文的评审，使用负面、正面和中性三种提示生成，可用于研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在科学同行评审中的潜在使用增加，需要全面数据集来理解LLM部署的效用和影响，但目前缺乏这样的数据集。

Method: 构建GenReview数据集，为ICLR 2018-2025年所有提交论文使用三种独立提示（负面、正面、中性）生成81K条LLM评审意见，并与原始论文和评审关联。

Result: 研究发现：LLM在评审中存在偏见；LLM生成的评审目前可以自动检测；LLM并不总是严格遵循评审指导；LLM提供的评分仅与论文接受决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview数据集填补了LLM生成评审数据集的空白，为研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响提供了重要资源，揭示了LLM在评审中的局限性。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [163] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二阶统计量的AUC优化新方法，通过构建二阶代理损失函数，解决了传统AUC优化中的非凸性和内存瓶颈问题，实现了更高效的在线学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要的性能指标，但在线优化AUC面临两个主要挑战：非凸不连续的成对0/1损失函数难以优化，以及实例级存储的高内存成本在大规模应用中造成瓶颈。

Method: 提出基于成对铰链损失的二阶代理损失函数，直接从训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量构建代理损失函数，替代传统的逐对近似方法，并开发了高效的在线算法和核方法扩展。

Result: 理论分析表明，该方法实现了O(ln T)的遗憾界，优于传统方法的O(√T)；在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法在优化在线AUC性能方面具有优越的效率和效果。

Conclusion: 通过引入基于二阶统计量的代理损失函数新范式，成功解决了AUC在线优化的核心挑战，为大规模不平衡分类问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

*Faisal Hamman,Pasan Dissanayake,Yanjun Fu,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoD的反事实解释增强蒸馏方法，用于解决小样本任务感知知识蒸馏中的数据稀缺问题。该方法通过利用反事实解释来精确映射教师模型的决策边界，显著减少所需样本数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务感知蒸馏方法需要大量数据，但在实际场景中这些数据可能难以获取或成本高昂。本文旨在解决小样本场景下的知识蒸馏挑战。

Method: CoD方法系统性地注入反事实解释（CFEs）——能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型预测输出的输入。利用CFEs精确映射教师决策边界，从统计和几何角度提供理论保证。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在小样本场景（低至8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法。CoD仅使用基线方法一半的原始样本，配合相应的CFEs仍能提升性能。

Conclusion: CoD方法通过反事实解释有效提升了小样本知识蒸馏的性能，为资源受限场景下的模型部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Motivation: 当前基于上下文学习的表格基础模型虽然表现出色，但指导合成先验分布设计的原则仍不明确，需要系统研究来填补这一空白。

Method: 系统识别合成先验的关键特性，并基于这些洞察开发了Mitra模型——在精心挑选的多样化、独特且性能优异的合成先验分布混合上进行训练。

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对表格基础模型的泛化能力至关重要，Mitra的成功证明了精心设计的先验混合策略的有效性。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Motivation: 传统GNN的固定消息传递架构难以适应现实世界中图结构的多样性，而现有的图MoE方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专用残差专家捕获多样化计算模式；结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由；使用统一无监督目标进行端到端训练。

Result: 在16个基准测试中验证了ADaMoRE在无监督节点分类和少样本学习中的最先进性能，具有优越的泛化能力、训练效率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: ADaMoRE通过无监督训练异构MoE，有效解决了GNN的适应性问题，在多样化图和任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Motivation: 解决传统流匹配生成模型中间生成步骤缺乏可解释性的问题，这些模型通过一系列向量场更新将噪声转换为数据，但每个步骤的含义不透明。

Method: 通过约束每个流步骤从已知物理分布中采样，将流轨迹映射到模拟物理过程的平衡状态。具体使用2D Ising模型，使流步骤成为参数化冷却计划中的热平衡点。架构包括编码器、流匹配网络和投影器。

Result: 在多种晶格尺寸上验证了该框架，在保持物理保真度的同时，随着晶格尺寸增大，生成速度优于蒙特卡洛方法。每个向量场代表了2D Ising模型潜在空间中有意义的逐步转变。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程，为生成模型提供了物理可解释性。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Motivation: 现有的模型合并方法在参数空间中操作，受到参数不一致性的限制，需要更鲁棒和灵活的方法来集成多个微调检查点的知识。

Method: 提出FDA框架，通过合成输入锚点来捕捉任务特定的功能偏移，这些锚点诱导的梯度与任务向量对齐，并提供了原则性的初始化方案。

Result: 综合实验证明了FDAs在模型合并中的有效性，并且与参数空间模型合并方法互补。

Conclusion: FDAs通过建模输入表示空间，为模型合并提供了新的视角，结合了联合多任务训练和后验合并的优点，具有鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Motivation: 在强化学习理论中，最混淆实例对于建立遗憾下界至关重要，但在一般情况下构建这样的实例仍然是一个开放问题。

Method: 将问题形式化为约束优化：寻找统计上接近参考模型但使最优和次优策略性能产生分歧的修改模型，提出对抗训练程序来解决这个问题。

Result: 实证研究表明，可实现的混淆程度与近似模型中的不确定性相关。

Conclusion: 这一发现可能为深度基于模型的强化学习提供理论基础的探索策略指导。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图注意力在处理全局交互时存在过聚合现象，即大量消息被不加区分地聚合到单个节点，导致关键信息被稀释和丢失。

Method: 将节点聚合划分为并行过程，限制每次聚合的输入量；通过排序和加权聚合输出，优先处理信息量大的消息。

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和消息优先级排序，成功解决了图注意力中的过聚合问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本限制，在真实世界域适应场景中展现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决真实世界传感器噪声对人类活动识别的挑战，通过训练与测试噪声模式匹配的模型来提高鲁棒性。

Method: 使用PatchTST变换器架构，为每个惯性传感器位置训练独立模型，采用1秒滑动窗口和随机抖动、缩放、旋转、通道丢失等数据增强技术。

Result: 在私有排行榜上，该方法获得了显著高于基线的macro-F1分数。

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强结合基于变换器的集成策略是在噪声条件下实现稳健人类活动识别的有效方法。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

*Xiyang Zhang,Chen Liang,Haoxuan Qiu,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DVC方法，一种预算感知的数据选择方法，用于MLP训练中的动态数据价值评估和选择，通过分层贡献度分解和多维度指标实现高效数据筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在非线性变换简化、中间表示忽略和计算复杂度方面存在局限，无法有效处理大规模MLP训练中的多源异构数据选择问题。

Method: DVC方法将数据贡献分解为层价值贡献(LVC)和全局价值贡献(GVC)，采用6个精心设计的指标从质量、相关性和分布多样性三个维度评估数据，并结合UCB算法进行自适应源选择。

Result: 在6个数据集和8个基线方法上的广泛实验表明，DVC在各种预算约束下始终优于现有方法，获得更高的准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: DVC是首个系统处理神经网络分层数据评估的方法，为大规模机器学习系统提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

*Shahaf Bassan,Michal Moshkovitz,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了广义可加模型(GAMs)解释生成的计算复杂性，发现在不同输入空间结构、组件模型类型、回归与分类任务以及不同解释方法下，GAMs的解释复杂性存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战GAMs作为可解释模型必然容易解释的假设，研究不同条件下生成GAMs解释的计算复杂性。

Method: 通过计算复杂性理论分析，在P!=NP等标准假设下，研究不同形式的GAMs在各种上下文中的解释生成复杂性。

Result: 发现GAMs的解释复杂性受输入空间结构影响显著；不同组件模型只在特定输入域下表现出复杂性差异；回归与分类任务的解释复杂性存在明显区别；将复杂模型表示为可加形式可能在某些条件下简化解释。

Conclusion: 为GAMs解释计算的可行性提供了严格的理论框架，揭示了在何种条件下这些计算是可行的或已被证明是困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时自适应框架，用于解决无监督异常检测中训练数据被污染的问题，通过整合预训练模型和经典方法提供的证据来更新模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的数据集通常包含未被检测到或错误标记的异常，导致无监督异常检测方法性能显著下降。现有解决方案需要访问训练流程、数据或先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时使用多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典异常检测方法（如潜在异常因子）或领域特定知识收集的证据来更新在污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出。

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业异常检测数据集上的综合实验验证了EPHAD的有效性，消融研究分析了超参数影响和对不同污染水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD展示了在不同异常检测模型和证据对中的多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染问题提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率框架，使用摊销变分推断直接逼近真实标签的后验分布，将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，在准确性和效率方面达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常存在噪声和歧义，在众包标注中人类标注者可能对相同实例分配冲突的类别标签。部分标签学习旨在处理这种情况，但现有方法要么计算密集，要么依赖启发式标签细化。

Method: 使用摊销变分推断，通过神经网络从输入数据预测变分参数来直接逼近真实标签的后验分布，实现高效推断，且与架构无关。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个邻接数据集框架来研究数据对模型多重性的影响，发现类间分布重叠更大的数据集反而表现出更低的多重性，这一反直觉现象源于共享的Rashomon参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注建模选择对多重性的影响，而数据在塑造多重性中的关键作用被相对忽视。本文旨在从最细粒度的角度——单数据点差异对多重性的影响进行研究。

Method: 引入邻接数据集框架，通过严格的数学证明分析单数据点差异对多重性的影响，并将该框架扩展到主动学习和数据插补两个实际应用领域。

Result: 发现类间分布重叠更大的邻接数据集表现出更低的多重性，这一发现与常规预期相反。基于此提出了针对主动学习和数据插补的多重性感知新方法。

Conclusion: 数据分布特性对模型多重性有重要影响，类间重叠反而降低多重性。提出的多重性感知方法为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单而通用的方法来解决多臂老虎机中的公平性问题，通过初始均匀探索阶段后接标准UCB算法，实现了对Nash遗憾和p-均值遗憾的（近似）最优边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂老虎机遗憾度量无法解决奖励分配公平性问题，特别是在需要公平分配奖励的场景中（如临床试验）。现有方法需要专门算法设计和强假设，限制了适用性。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加法Hoeffding界，可自然扩展到亚高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该方法实现了对Nash遗憾的近似最优边界，并能推广到更广泛的p-均值遗憾类别，在所有p值上实现统一的最优遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 相比现有需要强假设且只能获得次优边界的方法，本文提出的简单方法在更弱假设下实现了对公平性度量的最优性能。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分析自适应优化器（如Adam和Muon）在浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，解释了低精度训练有效的理论原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展使得低精度训练变得至关重要，但现有收敛理论假设所有组件都是精确的，忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释低精度训练为何仍然有效。

Method: 引入理论框架分析梯度、权重和优化器状态的浮点量化对自适应优化器收敛性的影响，推导平滑非凸目标下的收敛速率，并明确量化不同组件的误差如何影响收敛。

Result: 分析表明，只要尾数长度与迭代次数呈对数关系，两种算法都能保持接近全精度对应算法的收敛速率。Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，因此可能更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该研究缩小了低精度训练方法的实证成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Motivation: 传统MCMC方法收敛慢、模式混合差，而基于似然的机器学习方法需要大量数据且易出现模式覆盖和模式塌陷问题

Method: 基于归一化流架构的评分学习框架，集成独立Metropolis-Hastings模块，减少对大量MCMC生成训练数据的依赖

Result: 在合成2D分布和高维φ⁴晶格场理论分布上验证了方法的有效性，即使在小训练集下也能保持高性能

Conclusion: ScoreNF为从未归一化目标分布中采样提供了一种高效且无偏的方法，特别适合小数据集场景

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超人类模型日益复杂，人类可能无法有效监督其行为。现有弱到强泛化方法在分布偏移下表现不佳，导致强模型性能甚至弱于弱监督模型。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数，自动识别可信监督源。

Result: 在图像分类、文本分类和偏好对齐任务中，RAVEN在分布外任务上比基线方法提升30%以上，在分布内任务上达到或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAVEN能有效解决弱到强泛化在分布偏移下的挑战，自动分配更高权重给更准确的弱模型，实现鲁棒监督。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统收益率曲线估计方法（如自举法和Nelson-Siegel模型）在债券稀疏、价格波动或存在噪声时容易出现过度拟合或不稳定问题，需要更稳健的估计方法。

Method: 使用神经网络框架，每天独立估计收益率曲线，引入新的损失函数来强制平滑性和稳定性，并可集成领域特定约束（如与无风险基准对齐）。

Conclusion: 该神经网络框架为小型抵押债券市场提供了稳健的收益率曲线估计解决方案，允许从业者根据需求在平滑性和准确性之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Result: C-MCTD框架实现了从单个轨迹优化到完整计划组合推理的规划能力提升。

Conclusion: C-MCTD通过组合式规划方法有效解决了MCTD的局限性，实现了更高效的轨迹探索和规划。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Conclusion: 提出的OTCIL框架通过前向正则化和贝叶斯自适应机制，在在线任务无关类增量学习场景中取得了显著效果，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

*Stefan Kraft,Andreas Theissler,Vera Wienhausen-Wilke,Gjergji Kasneci,Hendrik Lensch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户实验评估了透明AI辅助在睡眠医学中的效果，发现透明AI作为质量控制步骤能显著提升性能，同时获得临床医生的广泛接受。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解释中表现优异，但临床实践中需要解决何时以及为何信任算法推荐的问题，以促进AI在临床工作流程中的有效整合。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用导向的用户研究，在三种条件下评分夜间觉醒事件：手动评分、黑盒AI辅助和透明白盒AI辅助，评估辅助类型和时机对性能的影响。

Result: 透明AI辅助作为质量控制步骤比黑盒辅助提升约30%的事件级性能，减少评分者间变异性，大多数参与者愿意采用该系统。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助能有效平衡准确性和临床效率，为可信AI集成和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦的模块化归纳偏置——组合偏置，通过随机重混合潜在变量并根据因子特定规则强制编码器发现因子结构，无需修改目标或架构即可实现属性和对象的解纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解纠缠表示学习方法严重依赖特定因子的策略，当新变化因子不符合先验假设或多个因子共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，导致显著开销。

Method: 使用因子特定的混合策略随机重混合潜在变量，通过先验损失确保每次重混合都能解码为真实图像，并结合组合一致性损失对齐复合图像与对应复合潜在表示。

Result: 在属性和对象解纠缠方面表现出竞争性性能，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解纠缠。

Conclusion: 该框架通过简单调整混合策略即可实现属性、对象甚至两者的解纠缠，无需修改目标或架构，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

*Camila Kolling,Vy Ai Vo,Mariya Toneva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型研究关联学习中的表征变化，发现词汇干扰影响表征分化，支持非单调可塑性假说


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关联学习是认知的基础，但难以在生物系统中测试表征变化假设。大语言模型提供了可扩展的替代方案来研究这些机制

Method: 基于大语言模型的上下文学习，改编认知神经科学关联学习范式，在六个模型中研究表征演化，分析词汇干扰的影响

Result: 发现非单调模式与NMPH一致，中等相似项目在学习后分化。词汇干扰（新关联与先验知识竞争）调节分化程度，干扰越高分化越强

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假设的可访问通用计算模型

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

### [193] [Self-diffusion for Solving Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21417)
*Guanxiong Luo,Shoujin Huang,Yanlong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了自扩散框架，无需预训练生成模型即可解决逆问题，通过交替加噪和去噪步骤逐步优化解估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散方法需要预训练模型来学习反向噪声过程，而自扩散旨在开发自包含的迭代过程，不依赖预训练模型

Method: 自扩散采用迭代过程，交替进行加噪和去噪。使用随机初始化的卷积网络作为自去噪器，通过数据保真度损失进行训练

Result: 在线性逆问题上，自扩散方法实现了与其他方法相当或更优的性能

Conclusion: 自扩散提供了一种灵活且广泛适用的逆问题解决方法，无需预训练分数函数或外部去噪器

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

rewards from an ensemble of world models. DreamerV3-XP is evaluated on a subset

original DreamerV3 results and showing that our extensions lead to faster
learning and lower dynamics model loss, particularly in sparse-reward settings.

### [195] [A Rapid Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Inverse Stefan Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21426)
*Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Ming-Yue Yang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机（PIELM）框架，用于解决逆Stefan问题，相比传统PINNs方法在精度和训练效率上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效的物理信息学习方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过优化由初始条件、边界条件和控制偏微分方程组成的物理定律损失向量来确定输出权重，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的最小二乘问题。

Result: 案例研究表明，PIELM相比传统PINNs方法，相对L2误差提高了3-7个数量级，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，在精度和效率方面都优于传统PINNs方法。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSAC框架结合因果表示学习和元actor-critic学习，通过稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响动态的最小邻域变量，实现大规模网络系统的可扩展性和领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模网络系统（如交通、电网、无线网络）中强化学习面临的规模和环境变化挑战。

Method: 每个智能体学习稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响动态的最小邻域变量，生成近似紧凑表示；元actor-critic在多个源域训练共享策略，并在测试时通过少量轨迹估计新域因子来部署适应策略。

Result: GSAC能够快速适应新领域，显著优于从头学习和传统适应基线方法。

Conclusion: GSAC通过因果表示学习和元学习相结合，有效解决了大规模网络系统中的可扩展性和领域泛化问题，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

*Zhuojing Tian,Yushu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一令牌表示(UTR)方法，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法如决策变换器存在冗余令牌化和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发UTR表示方法，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单一令牌，并基于此构建UDT(Transformer)和UDC(门控CNN)两种变体。

Result: 两种变体在性能上与最先进方法相当或更优，同时计算成本显著降低。理论分析显示UTR具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度界限。

Conclusion: UTR方法在不同架构上泛化良好，为未来大规模决策模型提供了高效的可扩展控制基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

TL;DR: ParaRNN是一个突破非线性RNN序列并行化障碍的框架，通过牛顿迭代和并行归约实现665倍加速，成功训练了70亿参数的非线性RNN模型，性能媲美同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN的序列性限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行化架构如Transformer和状态空间模型在线性约束下表达能力有限，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系序列转化为单一方程组，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约进行并行求解，实现了非线性RNN的并行化训练。

Result: 实现了高达665倍的加速比，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU变体模型，困惑度与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN突破了非线性RNN的并行化瓶颈，为大规模非线性序列建模提供了可行方案，并开源了代码框架以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将个性化解释作为推荐本身来学习，通过预测用户会为物品拍摄什么照片来生成有说服力的解释，从而提高推荐系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都至关重要。用户上传的照片可能反映了他们对物品的看法，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为有说服力的解释。

Method: 提出一个形式化框架来估计给定（用户，照片）对的作者概率。使用TripAdvisor数据，包含六个城市餐厅的评论和照片。

Result: 通过预测用户会拍摄的照片，推荐系统可以提供更具说服力的解释，增加系统可靠性。同时，公司可以获得关于客户关注产品哪些方面的生动知识。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐学习是可行的，预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为有效的解释方式，提升推荐系统的可信度和用户体验。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

TL;DR: 提出HINet方法，结合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，在网络设置中估计异质处理效应，解决未知暴露映射和网络级协变量偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性和处理分配机制的相互作用会导致网络级协变量偏移，影响处理效应估计准确性。

Method: 整合图神经网络与领域对抗训练，在未知暴露映射下估计处理效应，同时减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet方法能够有效处理网络环境中的异质处理效应估计问题，特别是在未知暴露映射和存在协变量偏移的情况下。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 该方法能够生成保留从简单成对关系到高阶交互的完整相关结构的合成数据。

Conclusion: GCM方法为合成数据生成提供了新途径，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Conclusion: ZEN实现了表达能力和效率的平衡，决策过程完全可解释，为数据集特性提供了洞察。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了Vapnik和Chervonenkis的框架，引入了均匀均值可估计性(UME-learnability)概念，证明了均值向量可分性是UME可学习性的充分条件但非必要条件，并解决了Cohen等人关于UME可学习集合可数并的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作主要关注使用经验均值估计器的均匀收敛性(P-Glivenko-Cantelli原则)，本文旨在超越经验均值估计器，研究任意估计器下集合是否允许均匀均值估计。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量可分性条件，并通过构造非可分但UME可学习的分布集合来证明可分性非必要性。

Result: 证明了均值向量可分性是UME可学习性的充分条件，构造了非可分但UME可学习的反例，并证明了UME可学习集合的可数并也是UME可学习的。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DEEDEE，一种用于强化学习时间序列的OOD检测器，仅使用episodewise均值和RBF核相似性来捕捉全局和局部偏差，计算效率高且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要研究RL时间序列的OOD检测方法。

Method: DEEDEE使用双统计量检测器，仅依赖episodewise均值和RBF核相似性来捕捉全局和局部偏差，是一种极简的替代方案。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD测试套件中匹配或超越了当代检测器，计算量减少600倍，平均绝对准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，不同类型的异常通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多项式混沌展开的代理模型方法，用于量化生成流网络在奖励函数存在不确定性时的策略不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络能够根据奖励函数采样高奖励的复杂对象，但奖励函数通常从噪声数据中近似估计，导致学习策略存在认知不确定性。

Method: 构建基于多项式混沌展开的代理模型，在小规模训练好的流网络集合上拟合，学习低维参数化奖励函数与流网络轨迹中每一步动作概率分布之间的关系。

Result: 代理模型可用于廉价的蒙特卡洛采样，估计在不确定奖励下的策略不确定性。在离散和连续网格世界、符号回归和贝叶斯结构学习任务上验证了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效量化生成流网络在奖励函数不确定性下的策略不确定性，为不确定环境下的决策提供支持。

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)解决8种灾后道路评估变体问题，通过单一神经网络实现多配置训练，显著减少训练时间和参数，在解质量和实时性上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法扩展性差且需要领域专业知识，现有深度强化学习方法采用单任务范式，缺乏对动态灾害场景的适应性。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过轻量级适配器机制实现高效微调，无需重新训练即可适应未见属性。

Result: UM将训练时间和参数减少8倍，解质量比单任务DRL方法提高6-14%，比传统优化方法提高24-82%，在1000节点网络中实现1-10秒实时求解。

Conclusion: UM为基于无人机的灾后道路评估提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的解决方案，推动了时间关键应用的神经组合优化发展。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探索了使用探针作为训练信号时如何避免Goodhart定律问题，发现基于探针的偏好优化能更好地保持探针检测能力，且探针多样性益处有限，重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针能检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），是重要的训练信号。但当探针成为训练目标时，可能因Goodhart定律而变得不可靠，需要研究如何在使用探针训练的同时保持其可靠性。

Method: 提出两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的探针训练方法，在毒性减少测试平台上评估探针准确率下降程度。尝试使用探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重新训练探针来保持检测准确性。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化意外地比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针检测能力；探针多样性提供的实际益处有限，只需在优化后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在某些对齐方法中可行，当重新训练可行时，探针集成大多不必要。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲(SRD)的伪异常生成方法，通过对抗训练增强弱监督视频异常检测模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型对对抗攻击脆弱，由于只有视频级标签而无法进行有效的帧级对抗训练，传统防御机制效果有限。

Method: 使用SRD方法在正常视频的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性，结合噪声伪标签减少标签噪声。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了模型鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比现有最优方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效实现了帧级对抗训练，显著增强了弱监督视频异常检测模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了修订相似性问题，并开发了Excision Score(ES)来衡量文档修订的相似性，通过移除共享内容来专注于差异部分，在代码编辑评估中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相似性度量方法（如BLEU）在评估文档修订时存在问题，因为它们被共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断。

Method: 提出Excision Score(ES)，使用最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与修订版本之间的共享内容，然后比较剩余的不同区域，并使用近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次。

Result: 在HumanEvalFix上的代码编辑评估中，ES比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准方法如BLEU提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES对SARI的改进增加到20%，对标准方法的改进增加到>30%。

Conclusion: ES通过专注于修订的差异部分而非共享内容，能够更好地与人类判断对齐，并在各种场景下表现优于现有相似性度量方法。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Motivation: 解决SAGIN-MEC在低空经济中面临的异构节点协调、移动性和网络变化建模、部分可观测环境下的实时决策等挑战。

Method: 采用分层SAGIN-MEC架构，提出MADDPG-COCG算法：使用MADDPG优化连续时间决策，结合凸优化和联盟博弈处理混合变量决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比基准算法，MADDPG-COCG显著降低了用户设备成本、任务完成延迟和能耗，仅略微增加无人机能耗，并具有优越的收敛稳定性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法有效解决了SAGIN-MEC中的复杂优化问题，为低空经济提供了高效的计算服务解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Conclusion: ZETA展示了将心电图分析与结构化临床知识对齐的潜力，有助于构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入到GNN中能为复杂真实世界图数据提供有用的归纳偏置，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Conclusion: REVE支持标准化EEG研究并加速临床神经科学进展，发布了代码、预训练权重和教程。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动方法在解空间中直接生成训练数据集，显著减少传统数值方法生成PDE数据所需的时间步数，降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动的深度学习方法需要大量解函数对，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，计算和时耗巨大。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数并降采样对齐时间步，然后采用"同源扰动"方法：将两个解函数（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，生成精度相当的PDE数据点，最后计算原始方程右端项变化形成新的解对。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度，在Navier-Stokes方程上生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够高效生成PDE训练数据，显著加速数据集生成过程，同时保持模型训练所需的近似精度。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Conclusion: 张量网络的SHAP计算复杂度主要受宽度而非深度影响，这为高效可解释AI提供了重要理论洞见，并统一了多种模型的SHAP计算复杂度分析。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

*Oscar Davis,Michael S. Albergo,Nicholas M. Boffi,Michael M. Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了广义流映射(GFM)，一种新的少步生成模型，将欧几里得空间中的流映射框架推广到任意黎曼流形上，实现了高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前几何生成模型在推理时计算成本高昂，需要复杂的数值模拟步骤，因为它们基于黎曼流形上的动力学测度传输框架（如扩散和流匹配）。

Method: 提出了三种基于自蒸馏的训练方法：广义拉格朗日流映射、广义欧拉流映射和广义渐进流映射，将GFM实例化。

Result: 在几何数据集（包括地理空间数据、RNA扭转角和双曲流形）上的基准测试显示，GFM在单步和少步评估中实现了最先进的样本质量，并使用隐式概率流获得了优越或具有竞争力的对数似然。

Conclusion: GFM在特定设计决策下，统一并提升了现有的欧几里得少步生成模型（如一致性模型、捷径模型和均值流）到黎曼设置。

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

*Maximilien Dreveton,Elaine Siyu Liu,Matthias Grossglauser,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，证明即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型(SBM和DCBM)的局限性，SBM假设顶点度均匀，DCBM在簇间应用统一的度校正，而PABM引入了簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数。

Method: 在PABM框架下分析聚类错误率的最优界限，通过理论推导和数值实验验证，使用包含k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法。

Result: 证明了PABM能捕捉DCBM忽略的度异质性维度：局部连接模式的差异可以独立于全局边密度增强簇可分性。谱聚类使用k²个特征向量优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PABM提供了更丰富的图结构建模，其期望邻接矩阵的秩在k到k²之间，传统基于前k个特征向量的谱嵌入可能丢失重要结构信息。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

Motivation: 在数据稀疏场景中，等变网络能改善建模效果，不确定性估计能防止过度自信，但等变性与模型置信度/校准之间的关系尚未被研究。

Method: 通过理论分析证明等变条件下不确定性校准误差（ECE和ENCE）的上下界，并用数值实验验证等变性与不确定性的关系，分析对称性不匹配、群大小以及偶然性和认知性不确定性的趋势。

Result: 建立了等变性与不确定性估计的理论框架，揭示了对称性不匹配会导致模型校准错误，并通过实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该工作首次系统阐明了等变性与模型校准之间的关系，为理解等变模型的泛化极限提供了理论基础，并揭示了对称性不匹配对模型不确定性的影响。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Motivation: 解决神经网络TSP求解器作为黑盒的问题，理解其学习的几何模式和在路径构建中使用的启发式方法。

Method: 在100节点TSP实例上训练指针网络，然后对编码器的残差流拟合稀疏自编码器，发现可解释特征的过完备字典。

Result: 发现求解器自然发展出反映基本TSP概念的特征：边界检测器（在凸包节点激活）、聚类敏感特征（响应局部密集区域）和分隔符特征（编码几何分区）。

Conclusion: 这是首次对神经TSP求解器在节点选择前计算内容的模型内部解释，证明了几何结构在没有显式监督的情况下出现，为结合神经效率和算法可解释性的透明混合系统提供了途径。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

TL;DR: 提出Equivariance by Contrast (EbC)方法，从观察对$(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$学习等变嵌入，无需依赖群特定归纳偏置，可处理非阿贝尔群和乘积群。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种通用方法，仅从群作用观察中学习等变嵌入，无需事先知道群结构或依赖群特定设计，解决现有方法对群结构先验知识的依赖问题。

Method: 联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应可逆线性映射，通过对比学习框架实现。在dSprites数据集上验证，处理由离散旋转和周期平移构成的有限群$G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_n)$。

Result: 生成的嵌入展现出高保真等变性，群操作在潜在空间中忠实再现。在合成数据上成功验证了正交群$O(n)$和一般线性群$GL(n)$，并提供了可识别性的理论证明。

Conclusion: 这是首个仅从群作用观察中成功实现通用编码器专用等变学习的演示，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和计算机视觉中建模仿射等变性的乘积群。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

*Abir Khan Ratul,Sanjay Acharjee,Somin Park,Md Nazmus Sakib*

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机交互流程，将手绘平面图转换为语义一致的3D BIM模型，使用多模态大语言模型和多智能体框架，通过反馈迭代提高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让专家和非专家都能通过手绘草图轻松创建BIM模型，降低BIM建模的技术门槛。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试，门窗口检测初始精度高，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐。所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用手绘草图即可完成。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，通过分离概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，在保持内部一致性的同时生成偏离文化惯例的创意想法，在艺术创作中实现人工文化异化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在开放领域艺术创作中要么遵循熟悉文化模式要么牺牲连贯性追求新颖性的问题，需要一种能同时保证创意新颖性和内部一致性的方法。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术品中共同出现的合理性，文化语境模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性低典型性的组合。

Result: 人类评估(N=100)显示CAS在感知原创性和和谐性方面优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术学生表现相当。定量研究表明该方法比GPT-4o产生更多样化输出，探索更广泛的概念空间。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化能够释放自主代理的创造潜力，CAS方法在保持内部一致性的同时有效偏离文化惯例，为开放领域创意生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在计算复杂度高、运算结果可能改变原始模糊集特征（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不再是三角模糊数）、以及模糊扩散等问题，这限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 使用外延模糊数来重新定义模糊数运算和关系运算符（=, >, >=, <, <=），并通过C++实现验证方法的可行性。

Result: 提出的外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算中的问题，并通过应用示例展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效和实用的替代方案，有望扩展模糊数在更多领域的应用。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录系统中药物数据标准化的问题，特别是在阿片类药物使用障碍治疗监测方面，由于处方属性分散在不同格式的字段和自由文本中，难以进行跨系统分析。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）来提取统一的MOUD处方属性，构建处理管道直接在固定JSON模式中处理记录，并进行轻量级标准化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在来自5个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B模型达到93.4%的覆盖率和93.0%的精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，能够在真实环境中实现一致的跨站点MOUD暴露、依从性和保留分析。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Motivation: 探讨在什么情况下应该依赖AI输出而非人类专家判断，分析AI作为人工认知权威的哲学基础及其局限性。

Method: 基于社会认识论理论，分析AI预占主义的缺陷，并构建总体证据观的替代框架。

Result: 识别了AI预占主义的三个主要问题：不加批判的顺从、认知固化和认知基础脱离，并提出了总体证据观的三个优势。

Conclusion: 总体证据观为AI依赖提供了原则性指导，特别是在高风险情境下，强调AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确转换为空间SQL查询，通过专门的智能体协作和程序化验证来提高空间查询的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL的复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数的专业性给非专家分析空间数据带来了显著障碍，而单智能体方法在处理空间查询的语义和句法复杂性方面存在困难。

Method: 开发了一个多智能体框架，包括知识库、程序化模式分析、语义丰富化、上下文检索嵌入，以及由实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查智能体组成的协作管道，其中审查智能体执行程序化和语义验证。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的总体准确率（272个问题中的221个），在空间查询中达到87.7%的准确率（90个问题中的79个），相比没有审查智能体时的76.7%有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作使空间分析更加易于访问，为空间文本到SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Method: 基于深度Q网络(DQN)，提出一种寻找与观测兼容的最坏情况下环境的安全策略的算法

Result: 在12个混淆的Atari游戏中测试，当行为策略和目标策略的观测输入不匹配且存在未观测混淆因子时，该算法始终优于标准DQN

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效处理观测数据中的混淆偏差，在存在未观测混淆因子的环境中表现出色

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

TL;DR: 提出了PACE数据集和PACER咨询模型，用于恐慌发作场景下的心理支持，通过多维度评估框架PanicEval验证了模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性的恐惧和痛苦发作，及时适当的干预能显著帮助个体恢复稳定，但训练此类模型的合适数据集由于伦理和后勤问题仍然稀缺。

Method: 引入PACE数据集（基于第一人称叙事构建的高痛苦发作数据集），围绕心理急救原则构建；训练PACER咨询模型，通过监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化，提供共情和指导性支持。

Result: 实验结果显示PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情绪改善方面均优于强基线模型；人类评估进一步证实其实用价值，在恐慌场景中持续优于通用、CBT基础和GPT-4驱动的模型。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌发作干预中表现出色，为心理健康支持系统提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，在RAG系统中实现高效知识投毒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG投毒攻击主要关注检索内容或提示结构操作，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分研究RAG投毒机制和知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文投毒知识强相关的毒害响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过归因信号重用有潜力但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法能持续实现超过90%的人口覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性，有效解决了知识冲突问题。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning框架通过神经元引导的投毒有效解决了知识冲突，能够大规模生成有效的RAG投毒知识，显著提高了攻击成功率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化框架，通过进化图优化方法自动设计更好的提示、高效推理过程，并提供增强的因果感知过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为大型语言模型设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，特别是如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合提示。

Method: EGO-Prompt从通用提示和容错的初始语义因果图开始，通过两步骤的因果引导文本梯度过程：首先生成确定性推理指导，然后使LLM有效利用该指导与原始输入。迭代优化算法使用文本梯度和真实标签进一步优化语义因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务上测试，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，使小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出改进的领域特定语义因果图提高可解释性。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt是一个有效的自动化框架，能够显著提升LLM在领域特定任务中的性能，同时提供更好的可解释性和成本效益。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来改进概率指令跟随(PIF)性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务上表现不佳，这影响了需要非确定性行为的应用(如人类行为模拟、内容多样化、多人游戏)和生成响应的多样性。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出一个随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来得出最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能显著改善LLMs的概率指令跟随能力和响应多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在真实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法在适应新任务时避免遗忘原有知识。

Method: 使用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架不仅有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准测试中也取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为真实世界应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形标准方法，容易出错、依赖理想化假设和大量数据，且在少样本多变量时间序列上容易过拟合

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享内核指数级减少参数数量，结合全局和局部约束实现网络间信息共享，还设计了带时间延迟的多变量时间序列数据生成方法

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于现有的两种最先进方法

Conclusion: Shylock方法在多变量时间序列因果发现方面表现优异，特别适用于少样本场景，并开发了Tcausal库和EarthDataMiner平台部署

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Conclusion: 总结了自主系统安全开发面临的挑战和未来研究方向，强调了OOD检测在确保自主系统安全运行中的重要性。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励且奖励尺度人为设定的游戏中，Q值可能跨越不同数量级，影响算法性能。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的以及五种新的λ选择策略，包括使用Q值经验标准差的方法。

Result: 新提出的2σ方法在各种任务中均优于现有λ策略，无论是单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数后的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用2σ作为UCT探索常数λ的自适应选择策略，该方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，如生成有害内容和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往抑制推理能力且无法解决安全与推理的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架，分析模型推理轨迹发现Self-Jailbreak现象，通过重组或回溯不安全推理步骤来引导模型回到安全轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全-推理权衡问题，证明了通过适当干预推理过程可以在不损害推理能力的前提下显著提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致代码生成不正确或不完整，影响任务成功率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 提出了CXRAgent，一个由导演协调的多阶段智能体，用于胸部X光片解读，通过工具调用、诊断规划和协作决策来提高诊断的适应性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，现有智能体依赖单一诊断流程且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制。

Method: 采用导演协调的三阶段方法：工具调用（通过证据驱动验证器验证输出）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合专家见解和上下文记忆）。

Result: 在各种CXR解读任务上表现出色，能提供视觉证据并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR诊断的适应性、可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习(RL)的框架，在1.5B模型上提升数学推理性能，相比仅用监督微调(SFT)的方法，在GSM8K数据集上准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预算强制(budget forcing)等测试时缩放方法依赖长上下文推理轨迹的SFT，但会导致小模型因冗长响应而性能下降，需要提高token效率并恢复长上下文训练带来的损失。

Method: 整合强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，在1.5B模型上进行SFT+RL联合训练，优化数学推理性能。

Result: SFT+RL模型在GSM8K数据集上表现更好，在不同计算预算下都获得更高准确率，同时token使用量比SFT模型减少超过40%。

Conclusion: RL可以有效恢复长上下文训练带来的损失，显著提高数学推理性能，同时大幅提升token效率。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络，不适合LLMs特性，需要系统理解如何有效集成符号AI到LLMs中。

Method: 首先回顾已建立的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLM符号集成的新分类法，通过四个维度组织现有文献：LLM各阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式、算法和应用层面视角。

Result: 开发了新的分类框架，识别了当前基准、前沿进展和关键差距，为未来研究提供了路线图。

Conclusion: 通过突出文献中的最新发展和显著差距，为将符号集成框架实施到LLMs中以增强透明度提供了实用见解。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，配套开发了AutoOpt框架，通过深度学习模型将优化问题图像转换为LaTeX代码，再生成PYOMO脚本，最后用双层优化分解方法自动求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工建模和编程的繁琐过程，开发一个能够直接从图像自动识别并求解优化问题的端到端系统。

Method: 提出三模块框架：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: 在AutoOpt-11k数据集上，MER任务的深度学习模型在BLEU分数上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架实现了从优化问题图像到求解的完全自动化，为数学优化领域提供了高效的工具，特别是在处理复杂优化问题时表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MoSES框架，通过状态可分解MDP和潜在空间扩展，利用专门的基础求解器组合解决多任务车辆路径问题，避免了统一求解器对VRP变体组合结构的低效利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法通常学习统一求解器同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，每个变体都可以从一组基础VRP变体派生而来。这导致统一求解器错失了专门基础求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 提出状态可分解MDP(SDMDP)，将状态空间表示为与基础VRP变体相关的基础状态空间的笛卡尔积。开发潜在空间扩展，结合最优基础策略和可学习混合函数，在潜在空间实现策略重用。实现MoSES求解器，通过专门的LoRA专家实现基础策略，自适应门控机制实现混合函数。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验表明，MoSES优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架使统一求解器能够通过主动重用基础求解器来感知VRP变体间的共享组件特性，同时缓解训练神经求解器的指数增长问题。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Motivation: 随着LLM代理在各种场景中的部署，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不良和/或不安全的行动。需要测量LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行动的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人工策划基准测试，通过将模型的函数调用与详尽引用相关立法的评分标准进行比较，评估前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究在系统提示中提供相关立法摘录对合规性的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构事实两个机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体在长程推理中因中间推理验证不足而失败的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的智能体在长程推理中因中间推理验证不足而导致的失败问题，传统方法主要关注生成能力而非验证过程。

Method: 采用冲突感知元验证(CAMV)和可信推理结构事实(TRSF)两个互补机制。CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，仅在专家智能体之间的分歧热点分配计算资源；TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%的准确率，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到35.5%，在Chinese-SimpleQA上达到93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为基于LLM的智能体提供了可扩展的可靠长程推理范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用是性能提升的关键。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模仿学习的安全约束函数训练方法，用于学习神经控制屏障函数，在无法明确定义故障状态集的情况下，通过专家演示数据来保证自主系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全性是基本要求。传统方法难以明确定义需要避免的故障状态集（如自动驾驶中的跟车过近），而生成专家演示数据相对容易。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹数据来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，该方法优于现有基线方法，性能与使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为在无法明确定义故障状态集的情况下学习安全控制器提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设编码基准性能越高意味着后续自我修改潜力越大，但作者发现自我改进潜力与编码基准性能之间存在不匹配问题，需要更准确的指标来指导自我改进过程。

Method: 提出CMP指标来聚合代理后代的基准性能作为自我改进潜力指标，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准上，HGM超越了现有自我改进编码代理开发方法，同时使用更少的实际时间。优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到了人类水平的性能。

Conclusion: CMP指标能有效衡量代码代理的自我改进潜力，HGM方法在多个编码数据集和大型语言模型上展现出强大的迁移能力，实现了与人类工程化编码代理相媲美的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Result: 在8个基准测试中（包括通用工具使用任务和下游应用），DeepAgent在标记工具和开放集工具检索场景下均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着构建更通用和强大的现实世界应用代理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and

agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

### [256] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全语境化到特定领域。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，需要更复杂的多本体匹配方法。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类别选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，在多本体匹配任务中表现出色，证明了专用策略的有效性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个专家标注的视频广告数据集，用于评估视觉语言模型在检测企业公关框架方面的能力，特别关注能源行业的绿色创新框架识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动常存在言行不一的问题（如石油公司的"漂绿"现象），需要大规模理解公关活动的框架变化来揭示其真实意图。

Method: 构建了一个包含Facebook和YouTube视频广告的基准数据集，标注了13种框架类型，涵盖50多家公司和20个国家，专门用于评估视觉语言模型。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1在环境信息检测上达到79% F1分数，但最佳模型在绿色创新框架识别上仅达到46% F1分数，表明仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源行业战略沟通的多模态分析研究，并识别了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战，如隐性框架、视频长度差异和文化背景处理。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 采用知识图谱的双平面架构，将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，使任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端流程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为病态反问题提供了一个鲁棒、可解释且可推广的解决方案，结合了数值方法和学习技术的优势。

Abstract: We present a framework for solving a broad class of ill-posed inverse
problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), where the target
coefficients of the forward operator are recovered through an iterative
regularization scheme that alternates between FEM-based inversion and learned
graph neural regularization. The forward problem is numerically solved using
the finite element method (FEM), enabling applicability to a wide range of
geometries and PDEs. By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM
discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned
regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative
to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework
outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate
reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.

Conclusion: 该优化方法可广泛应用于多种数值方案，构建高性能的不变域保持格式，为压缩流方程的高精度计算提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We introduce effective splitting methods for implementing optimization-based
limiters to enforce the invariant domain in gas dynamics in high order accurate
numerical schemes. The key ingredients include an easy and efficient explicit
formulation of the projection onto the invariant domain set, and also proper
applications of the classical Douglas-Rachford splitting and its more recent
extension Davis-Yin splitting. Such an optimization-based approach can be
applied to many numerical schemes to construct high order accurate, globally
conservative, and invariant-domain-preserving schemes for compressible flow
equations. As a demonstration, we apply it to high order discontinuous Galerkin
schemes and test it on demanding benchmarks to validate the robustness and
performance of both $\ell^1$-norm minimization limiter and $\ell^2$-norm
minimization limiter.

Abstract: This work deals with two groups of spectral analysis results for matrices
arising in fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods used for linear time-dependent

Abstract: This paper establishes the first-order convergence rate for the ergodic error
of numerical approximations to a class of stochastic ODEs (SODEs) with
superlinear coefficients and multiplicative noise. By leveraging the generator
approach to the Stein method, we derive a general error representation formula
for one-step numerical schemes. Under suitable dissipativity and smoothness
conditions, we prove that the error between the accurate invariant measure

$\mathscr{O}(\tau)$, which is sharp. Our framework applies to several recently
studied schemes, including the tamed Euler, projected Euler, and backward Euler

Abstract: We propose a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM)

approximations on overlapping subdomains as the sum of a local source solution
and a correction from an optimal spectral coarse space, which is obtained from
a generalized eigenproblem. The global solution is then assembled via a
partition of unity. We prove nearly exponential decay of the approximation
error for second-order elliptic problems discretized with a weighted symmetric
interior-penalty DG scheme.

Motivation: 由于大多数实际PDE无法解析求解且受计算模型限制，需要研究PDE解的图灵可计算性来区分算法可解方程与固有不可计算行为。

Conclusion: 提出的优化视角框架为研究PDE解的可计算性和复杂性提供了新方法，能够识别不同复杂性机制下的PDE求解行为。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental tools for modeling
physical phenomena, yet most PDEs of practical interest cannot be solved
analytically and require numerical approximations. The feasibility of such
numerical methods, however, is ultimately constrained by the limitations of
existing computation models. Since digital computers constitute the primary
physical realizations of numerical computation, and Turing machines define
their theoretical limits, the question of Turing computability of PDE solutions
arises as a problem of fundamental theoretical significance. The Turing
computability of PDE solutions provides a rigorous framework to distinguish
equations that are, in principle, algorithmically solvable from those that
inherently encode undecidable or non-computable behavior. Once computability is
established, complexity theory extends the analysis by quantifying the
computational resources required to approximate the corresponding PDE
solutions. In this work, we present a novel framework based on least-squares
variational formulations and their associated gradient flows to study the
computability and complexity of PDE solutions from an optimization perspective.
Our approach enables the approximation of PDE solution operators via discrete
gradient flows, linking structural properties of the PDE, such as coercivity,
ellipticity, and convexity, to the inherent complexity of their solutions. This
framework characterizes both regimes where PDEs admit effective numerical
solvers in polynomial-time and those exhibiting complexity blowup, where the
input data possess polynomial-time complexity, yet the solution itself scales
super-polynomially.

Conclusion: 该方法为分数阶ZK方程提供了高效、高精度的数值求解方案，适用于各种分数阶阶数。

Abstract: This paper develops a fully discrete Fourier spectral Galerkin (FSG) method
for the fractional Zakharov-Kuznetsov (fZK) equation posed on a two-dimensional
periodic domain. The equation generalizes the classical ZK model to incorporate
nonlocal dispersion through a fractional Laplacian of order $\alpha \in [1,2]$.
We first propose a semi-discrete FSG scheme in space that preserves the
discrete analogs of mass, momentum, and energy. The existence and uniqueness of
semi-discrete solutions are established. Using compactness arguments, we prove
the uniform convergence of the semi-discrete approximations to the unique
solution of the fZK equation for the periodic initial data in
$H^{1+\alpha}_{\mathrm{per}}(\Omega)$. The method achieves spectral convergence
of order $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r})$ for initial data in $H^r_{\mathrm{per}}$ with $r
\geq \alpha+1$, and exponential convergence for analytic solutions utilizing a
modified projection. An efficient integrating-factor Runge-Kutta time
discretization is designed to handle the stiff fractional term, and an error
analysis is presented. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results
and demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various fractional orders.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了指数Runge-Kutta方法，使其能够处理非齐次边界条件问题，通过边界数据平滑扩展的修正策略避免阶数降低，在线性和半线性问题中恢复了预期的收敛阶数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指数Runge-Kutta方法通常假设齐次边界条件，但在实际应用中非齐次边界条件很常见，且会导致数值方法的阶数降低，因此需要开发能够处理非齐次边界条件的有效方法。

Method: 提出基于边界数据平滑扩展的修正策略，将非齐次边界条件问题重新表述为具有修正源项的齐次问题，然后应用标准指数积分器。对于线性问题使用适当求积规则可达2s阶，半线性问题保持原有收敛阶。

Result: 理论证明修正后的方法在线性问题中恢复了预期收敛阶，s阶段Gauss配置方法可达2s阶；半线性问题保持了指数Runge-Kutta方法原有的收敛阶。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 提出的修正策略成功解决了非齐次边界条件下指数Runge-Kutta方法的阶数降低问题，为抛物型演化方程的数值积分提供了更通用的工具。

Abstract: Exponential Runge-Kutta methods are a well-established tool for the numerical
integration of parabolic evolution equations. However, these schemes are
typically developed under the assumption of homogeneous boundary conditions. In
this paper, we extend classical convergence results to the case of
non-homogeneous boundary conditions. Since non-homogeneous boundary conditions
typically cause order reduction, we introduce a correction strategy based on
smooth extensions of the boundary data. This results in a reformulation as a
homogeneous problem with modified source term, to which standard exponential
integrators can be applied. For linear problems, we prove that the corrected
schemes recover the expected convergence order, and hat higher orders can be
attained with suitable quadrature rules, reaching order $2s$ for s-stage Gauss
collocation methods. For semilinear problems, our approach preserves the
convergence orders guaranteed by exponential Runge-Kutta methods satisfying the
corresponding stiff order conditions. Numerical experiments validate the
theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 所提出的张量导向方法在求解复杂分数阶偏微分方程方面具有显著优势，能够大幅提升计算效率

Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose matrix- and tensor-oriented methods for the
numerical solution of the multidimensional evolutionary space-fractional
complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. After a suitable spatial semidiscretization,
the resulting system of ordinary differential equations is time integrated with
stiff-resistant schemes. The needed actions of special matrix functions (e.g.,
inverse, exponential, and the so-called $\varphi$-functions) are efficiently
computed in a direct way by exploiting the underlying tensor structure of the
task and taking advantage of high performance BLAS and parallelizable pointwise
operations. Several numerical experiments in 2D and 3D, where we apply the
proposed technique in the context of linearly-implicit and exponential-type
schemes, show the reliability and superiority of the approach against the
state-of-the-art, allowing to obtain speedups which range from one to two
orders of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that in our context a single GPU
can be effectively exploited to boost the computations both on consumer- and
professional-level hardware.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不需要额外网格修改的情况下实现自适应模拟，显著改进了现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive refinement strategy for Isogeometric
Analysis (IGA) using Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines). The
proposed strategy enhances locally-refined meshes for specific applications,
simplifying implementation. We focus on two key applications: an $L^2$-stable
local projector for THB-splines via B\'ezier projection [Dijkstra and Toshniwal
(2023)], and structure-preserving discretizations using THB-splines [Evans et
al. (2020), Shepherd and Toshniwal (2024)]. Previous methods required mesh
modifications to retain crucial properties like local linear independence and
the exactness of discrete de Rham complexes. Our approach introduces a
macro-element-based refinement technique, refining $\vec{q} =
q_1\times\cdots\times q_n$ blocks of elements, termed $\vec{q}$-boxes, where
the block size $\vec{q}$ is determined by the spline degree and application.
For the B\'ezier projection, we refine $\vec{p}$-boxes (i.e., $\vec{q} =
\vec{p}$), ensuring THB-splines are locally linearly independent in these
boxes, which enables a straightforward extension of the B\'ezier projection
algorithm, greatly improving upon Dijkstra and Toshniwal (2023). For
structure-preserving discretizations, we refine $(\vec{p+1})$-boxes (i.e.,
$\vec{q} = \vec{p}+\vec{1}$), demonstrating that this choice meets the
sufficient conditions for ensuring the exactness of the THB-spline de Rham
complex, as outlined by Shepherd and Toshniwal (2024), in any dimension. This
critical aspect allows for adaptive simulations without additional mesh
modifications. The effectiveness of our framework is supported by theoretical
proofs and numerical experiments, including optimal convergence for adaptive
approximation and simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Abstract: This work describes and analyzes the domain derivative for a time-dependent
acoustic scattering problem. We study the nonlinear operator that maps a
sound-soft scattering object to the solution of the time-dependent wave
equation evaluated at a finite number of points away from the obstacle. The
Fr\'echet derivative of this operator with respect to variations of the
scatterer coincides with point evaluations of the temporal domain derivative.
The latter is the solution to another time-dependent scattering problem, for
which a well-posedness result is shown under sufficient temporal regularity of
the incoming wave. Applying convolution quadrature to this scattering problem
gives a stable and provably convergent semi-discretization in time, provided
that the incoming wave is sufficient regular. Using the discrete domain
derivative in a Gauss--Newton method, we describe an efficient algorithm to
reconstruct the boundary of an unknown scattering object from time domain
measurements in a few points away from the boundary. Numerical examples for the
acoustic wave equation in two dimensions demonstrate the performance of the
method.

Result: 证明了两种构造方法的数学等价性，在适当正则性假设下，稀疏网格张量积空间能达到与标准张量积空间相同的逼近阶，但使用更少的自由度。

Conclusion: 稀疏网格张量积方法在一般几何域上具有显著优势，但需要更强的正则性假设来保证最优收敛率，特别是在非张量积域上。

Abstract: This work introduces and analyzes B-spline approximation spaces defined on
general geometric domains obtained through a mapping from a parameter domain.
These spaces are constructed as sparse-grid tensor products of univariate
spaces in the parameter domain and are mapped to the physical domain via a
geometric parametrization. Both the univariate approximation spaces and the
geometric mapping are built using maximally smooth B-splines. We construct two
such spaces, employing either the sparse-grid combination technique or the
hierarchical subspace decomposition of sparse-grid tensor products, and we
prove their mathematical equivalence. Furthermore, we derive approximation
error estimates and inverse inequalities that highlight the advantages of
sparse-grid tensor products. Specifically, under suitable regularity
assumptions on the solution, these spaces achieve the same approximation order
as standard tensor product spaces while using significantly fewer degrees of
freedom. Additionally, our estimates indicate that, in the case of
non-tensor-product domains, stronger regularity assumptions on the solution --
particularly concerning isotropic (non-mixed) derivatives -- are required to
achieve optimal convergence rates compared to sparse-grid methods defined on
tensor-product domains.

Abstract: This paper addresses the analysis and numerical assessment of a computational
method for solving the Cahn--Hilliard equation defined on a surface. The
proposed approach combines the stabilized trace finite element method for
spatial discretization with an implicit--explicit scheme for temporal
discretization. The method belongs to a class of unfitted finite element
methods that use a fixed background mesh and a level-set function for implicit
surface representation. We establish the numerical stability of the discrete
problem by showing a suitable energy dissipation law for it. We further derive
optimal-order error estimates assuming simplicial background meshes and finite
element spaces of order $m \geq 1$. The effectiveness of the method is
demonstrated through numerical experiments on several two-dimensional closed
surfaces, confirming the theoretical results and illustrating the robustness
and convergence properties of the scheme.

Abstract: Spiral wave solutions are found in linear and weakly nonlinear irrotational
water wave equations. These unsteady spiral waves evolve from suitable initial
conditions; they are not induced by external forcing. In the linear case, a
long-time asymptotic result is obtained via the method of stationary phase. The
asymptotic approximation is found to be in good agreement with the exact
solution and reveals hyperbolic spiral structure. Numerical simulations show
that these spiral waves persist in the presence of weak nonlinearity. While
spiral solutions are frequently found in excitable media governed by
reaction-diffusion systems, they comprise a new class of interesting two space
one time dimensional solutions in fundamental linear and nonlinear dispersive
wave systems.

TL;DR: 研究粘塑性液体薄膜在湍流空气层驱动下的动力学，探索屈服应力效应对粘液运输的影响，发现局部屈服和波生成机制导致"吹出"事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 咳嗽清除气道是粘液运输的关键机制，特别是在与改变的粘液流变学相关的阻塞性肺病中。研究旨在理解屈服应力效应对空气驱动粘液运输的影响。

Method: 采用长波模型进行理论分析，并通过实验在矩形管道中对牛顿流体和屈服应力液体层暴露于气流进行验证。

Result: 发现层深扰动可导致局部屈服和波生成。当波前流体未屈服时，波传播会消耗静态流体并在后方沉积更薄薄膜，这导致实验中剧烈的"吹出"事件。牛顿薄膜则形成多个表面波，仅在足够厚时发生吹出。

Conclusion: 屈服应力效应显著影响空气驱动粘液运输的动力学，局部屈服机制导致独特的波传播和吹出现象，与牛顿流体行为形成鲜明对比。

Abstract: Airway clearance by coughing is a key mechanism for mucus transport,
particularly in obstructive lung diseases associated with altered mucus
rheology. We investigate the dynamics of a viscoplastic liquid film driven by
flow in a turbulent air layer, which is a model for air-driven mucus transport
that incorporates yield-stress effects. Our theoretical analysis is based on a
long-wave model for the liquid film flow, and we complement this with
experiments, in which layers of Newtonian and yield-stress liquids are exposed
to air flow in a rectangular duct. We demonstrate how perturbations to the
layer depth can lead to localised yielding and wave generation. Rapid wave
growth occurs when the fluid ahead of the oncoming wave is unyielded, so that
as the wave propagates, it consumes this static fluid while depositing a much
thinner film behind. This mechanism causes dramatic "blow-out" events in
experiments, where liquid hits the roof of the tank. By contrast, in Newtonian
thin films, multiple surface waves typically form, and blow-out only occurs in
experiments when a Newtonian film is sufficiently thick.

Motivation: 开发一种能够从有限传感器数据中准确重建流场的方法，特别是在大攻角范围内，以支持自适应流动控制策略。

Method: 使用两个独立的浅层神经网络结合本征正交分解(POD)，通过方差准则确定传感器数量和位置，基于2D URANS模拟数据进行训练。

Result: 在训练集内攻角的最大MSE误差为2.9%，插值攻角为6.6%，能够正确恢复流动的平均特性。

Conclusion: SNN-POD方法能够从单时间传感器数据有效估计流场，为开发自适应改进策略提供了可能。

Abstract: We present an efficient neural-based approach to estimate the instantaneous
flow field around an airfoil from limited surface pressure measurements. The
model, denoted SNN-POD, relies on two independent shallow neural networks to
predict the instantaneous flow over a wide range of angles of attack
[10{\textdegree},20{\textdegree}]. At all angles the global model correctly
recovers the average characteristics of the flow from single-time sensor data,
thus allowing combination with local, angle-dependent models. The method is
applied to 2D URANS simulations of a thick airfoil at a Reynolds number of
Re=4.5e6. The training set consists of snapshots obtained from a coarse
sampling (1-2{\textdegree}) of the angle of attack range. A variance-based
criterion is used to determine the number and positions of sensors. Tests are
carried out for unseen snapshots at angles of attack within the set (sampled
angles) as well as outside the set (interpolated angles). The maximum MSE error
of attack for sampled and interpolated angles is respectively 2.9% and 6.6%.
This makes it possible to develop adaptive strategies to improve the estimation
if necessary.

Conclusion: 建立了YBJ方程与量子力学的精确类比，成功预测了近惯性波场的组织化规律，为Danioux等人的观测结果提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: We revisit the interaction of an initially uniform near-inertial wave (NIW)
field with a steady background flow, with the goal of predicting the subsequent
organization of the wave field. To wit, we introduce an exact analogy between
the Young Ben Jelloul (YBJ) equation and the quantum dynamics of a charged
particle in a steady electromagnetic field, whose potentials are expressed in
terms of the background flow. We derive the time-averaged spatial distributions
of wave kinetic energy, potential energy and Stokes drift in two asymptotic
limits. In the `strongly quantum' limit where the background flow is weak
compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by extending a
strong-dispersion expansion initially introduced by YBJ. In the
`quasi-classical' limit where the background flow is strong compared to wave
dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by leveraging the equilibrium
statistical mechanics of classical systems. We compare our predictions to
numerical simulations of the YBJ equation, using an instantaneous snapshot from
a two-dimensional turbulent flow as the steady background flow. The agreement
is very good in both limits. In particular, we quantitatively describe the
preferential concentration of NIW energy in anticyclones. We predict weak NIW
concentration in both asymptotic limits of weak and strong background flow, and
maximal anticyclonic concentration for background flows of intermediate
strength, providing theoretical underpinning to observations reported by
Danioux, Vanneste and B\"uhler (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 773, 2015).
