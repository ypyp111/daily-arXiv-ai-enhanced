The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends\nfeatures of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in\nmulti-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media\ncharacterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow\nbehavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and\nby Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from\nthe incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the\nStokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The\nprimary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified\nnumerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow\nregimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to\nresolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework. The\nmethod supports general finite element partitions consisting of convex and\nnon-convex polytopal elements, and employs bubble functions as a critical\nanalytical component to achieve stability and convergence.

SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable\nimprovements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and\n10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the\ncaptioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding\nthose of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In\nthe VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple\nSAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning\nability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,\nas a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the\ncommunity to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets."}

To further assess these disparities, we\nemployed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical\npatterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of\naggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings\nunderscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and\nemphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing\ninterventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development."}

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation.

This creates new\nchallenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video\nexperience.

Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This\ncompositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural\nprinciples underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:\nhttps://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory"}

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas.

In this work, we formalize point cloud querying\nby defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each\naligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on\naccurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object\ncounting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on\nindexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide\naccurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,\nstate-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object\ncounts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this\nlimitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for\naccurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing\non accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding\nobject centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance\nwith a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling\nbetter handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To\nadapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model\nselection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each\ninput.

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a\ncritical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and\nnumber of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To\naddress this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,\nwhich aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using\nlimited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective\nsolution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first\nscene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a\ntwo-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.\nThis framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the\nLane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies\nand distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained\nlane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline\nmodels with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive\nexperiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate\nthe effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

While recent advances have\nled to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the\ninternal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well\nas their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability\ndevelopment and the reliable transition of research progress into practical\ndeployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily\ncomputer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15\napplications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and\na generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To\nenable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with\nreal-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation\nlevel across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand\nhierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and\ngeneralization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for\nstructured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even\nState-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks\ninvolving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a\ndeeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future\nprogress in computer-using agents research and deployment.

While remote physiological\nmeasurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to\nreal-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of\ncomprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality\ndiversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured\nconditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,\nwe present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless\nin-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various\nmodality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,\nincluding synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,\naccompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,\nand SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,\nincluding driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road\nconditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning\nmethods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all\nmodalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream\npublic toolboxes.

To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention\n(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while\nsuppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated\ninto a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and\nbalanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method\noutperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by\n61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that\nchannel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis\nfor VLSI."}
