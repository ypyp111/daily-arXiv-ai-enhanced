### [1] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)框架，用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习和注意力机制在有限标注数据下实现高效缺陷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施检查中标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，以及现有深度学习框架无法用少量数据学习新缺陷类别的局限性。

Method: 使用自适应E-FPN编码器（InceptionSepConv块和深度可分离卷积）、带掩码平均池化的原型学习、以及全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力机制。

Result: 在8-way 5-shot训练配置下，2-way分类测试达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，自注意力方法带来2.57% F1分数和2.9% mIoU提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够快速响应基础设施检查系统中的新缺陷类型，仅需有限的新训练数据，从而为关键基础设施系统提供更高效经济的维护方案。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，用于远程光电容积描记法(rPPG)中的心率监测，通过优先选择皮肤区域来提高信号质量，在具有挑战性的条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: rPPG技术对光照和运动敏感，现有方法在无监督流程中需要准确选择皮肤区域来提取信号。需要一种能检测全身皮肤区域、抵抗运动干扰并去除干扰区域（如嘴、眼、头发）的技术。

Method: 引入新颖的皮肤分割技术，优先选择皮肤区域，检测全身皮肤区域，去除可能引起干扰的区域（嘴、眼、头发），并在公开数据集和新数据集SYNC-rPPG上进行评估。

Result: 模型在具有挑战性的条件（如说话和头部旋转）下表现出捕捉心跳的优先能力，保持预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差(MAE)，而其他方法无法做到。同时在不同肤色检测中表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: 该技术是现实世界应用的有前景选择，能够在各种肤色检测中保持高准确性，并在挑战性条件下维持心率监测的稳定性。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAf是一个结合空间和光谱特征的自动对焦框架，可将传统显微镜转换为高效玻片扫描仪，在资源受限环境中实现实时数字病理学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全玻片成像扫描仪成本高昂，现有低成本解决方案存在对焦不一致、耗时或泛化能力差的问题，需要一种更有效的自动对焦方法。

Method: 提出DeepAf框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳焦点的距离并调整控制参数。

Result: 对焦时间比基于堆栈的方法减少80%，对焦精度达0.18μm，在536个脑组织样本的临床研究中，4x放大倍数下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了在资源受限环境中可访问的实时数字病理学，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了动态引导方法，通过选择性锐化导致伪影方向的分数函数来减少扩散模型中的幻觉生成，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成令人印象深刻的样本，但经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本位于真实数据分布的支撑集之外。这些幻觉可归因于数据分布模式之间的过度平滑。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，通过仅沿已知会导致伪影的预定方向选择性锐化分数函数来缓解幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。

Result: 动态引导在受控和自然图像数据集上显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉问题的方法，动态引导能有效减少扩散模型中的幻觉生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费的视频生成加速方法LightCache，通过分析扩散模型推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，设计了阶段特定的内存优化策略，在保持质量的同时实现更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的视频生成中，推理过程中的潜在变量冗余为加速提供了切入点，但现有的基于缓存的加速方法往往在去噪和解码阶段导致内存激增。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码三个阶段，提出三种阶段特定的内存优化策略：异步缓存交换、特征分块和切片解码，确保引入的时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: LightCache通过阶段特定的优化策略，在视频生成扩散模型中有效平衡了加速效果与内存消耗，为训练免费加速提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热成像的时间反演重建框架，利用RGB和热图像对来恢复几秒前的场景状态，结合视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程实现语义一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能够捕捉人机交互留下的热痕迹，这些逐渐消失的印记可作为被动时间编码，推断近期事件，超越RGB相机的能力。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程耦合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，能够重建120秒前合理的过去帧，为基于热痕迹的时间反演成像提供了初步验证。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从热痕迹重建过去场景状态的可行性，是时间反演成像领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用可训练映射网络pi-map的方法，能够将对象实例的图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询实现个性化图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是实现结合对象实例信息和自然语言描述的复合查询图像检索，例如检索"独角兽Fluffy在某人头上"的图像。

Method: 设计映射网络将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询进行CLIP风格文本编码和图像检索。每个对象实例只需训练一次映射网络。

Result: 使用可训练映射网络pi-map配合冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器，在两个个性化检索基准测试中提升了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将对象实例图像嵌入转换为文本标记，有效实现了结合视觉实例和文本描述的复合查询图像检索。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯头像框架，通过UV特征场和动态重采样实现渲染效率与视觉质量的可调节平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS头像使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节级别，限制了在需要平衡渲染效率与视觉质量的应用中的实用性。

Method: 在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯点，构建多级可学习特征图组成的UV特征场，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节级别实现SOTA质量，最低细节级别仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%，PSNR -0.97%，SSIM -0.6%，LPIPS损失+24.1%），渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练即可连续控制细节级别的3D高斯头像，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云的动作识别新方法，结合深度传感器和单目深度估计数据，通过人体点云分割、跟踪和身体部位分割，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，需要利用密集3D数据开发第三种动作识别方法，补充现有的骨骼动作识别和视频方法。

Method: 提出包含人体点云分割、个体跟踪和身体部位分割的流水线，核心是结合点基技术和稀疏卷积网络的3D动作识别骨干网络，使用体素映射的点云序列。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现优异，与现有骨骼动作识别算法竞争，结合传感器和估计深度输入的集成方法达到89.3%准确率，优于之前的点云动作识别方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D动作识别提供了有效的新途径，证明了点云数据在动作识别任务中的潜力，特别是在结合多种深度数据源时表现更佳。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，用于在扩散模型的噪声空间中生成更自然的数据流形感知插值路径


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间，限制了流形感知的分析和操作，现有插值方法生成的非流形对齐路径导致感知不自然的过渡

Method: 基于得分函数雅可比矩阵捕获数据流形切空间的发现，在噪声空间中定义黎曼度量，使测地线保持在或平行于学习的数据流形

Result: 实验表明该方法在图像插值中比现有的基于密度和朴素基线方法产生感知上更自然和忠实的过渡

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼度量方法能够有效利用扩散模型学习的数据流形，生成更自然的插值路径

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

TL;DR: Teamwork提出了一种灵活统一的解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来实现通道扩展，无需改变预训练扩散模型架构，支持多种图形任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常是特定于应用的，难以适应不同的扩散模型或新任务，需要一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调，采用改进的低秩适应（LoRA）方法同时处理适应和协调问题，支持队友的动态激活/停用。

Result: 在多种生成和逆图形任务上验证了方法的灵活性和效率，包括修复、单图像SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种高效统一的通道扩展解决方案，能够灵活适应不同扩散模型和多种图形任务。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

### [14] [Midway Network: Learning Representations for Recognition and Motion from Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05558)
*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种自监督学习架构，首次仅从自然视频中同时学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表示，通过将潜在动态建模扩展到该领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要专注于获取识别或运动的丰富表示，而物体识别和运动理解作为感知的关键组成部分应该互补。潜在动态建模在决策制定中已用于学习观察及其随时间变化的潜在表示，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习。

Method: Midway Network利用中间自上而下路径推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，采用密集前向预测目标和分层结构来处理自然视频中复杂的多对象场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network能够同时学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表示，其学习的动态可以通过基于前向特征扰动的新分析方法捕捉高级对应关系。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

TL;DR: HoloScene是一个新颖的交互式3D重建框架，通过综合场景图表示和能量优化方法，同时实现几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性和逼真渲染，用于创建可靠的数字孪生环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、逼真渲染或可靠动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要一种能同时满足这些关键要求的解决方案。

Method: 采用综合交互式场景图表示，编码物体几何、外观和物理属性以及层次关系；将重建表述为基于能量的优化问题，整合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验；通过采样探索和梯度优化的混合方法进行高效优化。

Result: 生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的逼真渲染效果；在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，在交互游戏和实时数字孪生操作等实际应用中验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HoloScene框架成功解决了当前3D重建方法的局限性，为增强现实、虚拟现实、游戏和机器人等领域提供了高质量的交互式数字孪生环境。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，通过对比视觉增强器和判别概念校准器来校准视觉语言模型中主导令牌的抑制效应，提升文本驱动图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制文本驱动图像检索任务中的判别特征。

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器，将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间引入判别概念校准器，区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在涵盖三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进，证明了CalibCLIP的有效性。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了文本驱动图像检索的性能，无需额外训练即可在各种基准测试中取得显著改进。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉思维链的冗余，在保持图像质量的同时将提示推理长度减少54%，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归多模态大语言模型使用思维链推理来增强图像生成的对齐性和细节，但这种方法引入了不必要的冗余（视觉过度思考），增加了计算成本并可能产生与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，通过自适应奖励函数鼓励更简洁的思维链提示，并将该奖励整合到强化学习范式中。

Result: 在多个基准测试（T2I-CompBench、GenEval）上，该方法将提示推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提高质量指标。定性分析显示消除了冗长解释和重复优化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下提高了计算效率，产生了既简洁又语义丰富的推理提示。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测方法依赖VLM先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂；MLLM在HOI检测中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，使用强化学习方法训练MLLM，通过纯文本解决HOI检测任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍的准确率，具有很好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOI检测任务中的潜力，无需复杂检测模块即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Motivation: 现有自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致高昂训练成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在基于尺度的自回归模型上验证，实现了高保真度和多样性的图像生成控制，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ECM框架在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了训练和推理效率，为自回归模型的条件生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PointNSP是一个从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归模型在无序点集上强加人工排序的问题，在生成质量上首次超越了扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成方法由于在无序点集上强加人工排序，导致模型过度关注局部连续性而无法捕捉长距离依赖关系，无法保证全局结构特性如对称性、一致拓扑和大尺度几何规律。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，受形状建模中的细节层次原则启发，采用从粗到细的生成策略：在低分辨率下保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步在高尺度上细化几何细节。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到了最先进的生成质量，并且在参数、训练和推理效率上超越了强大的扩散基线模型，在8192点的高密度生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，实现了丰富的尺度内交互同时避免了脆弱的固定排序，展示了在点云生成领域的可扩展潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型缺乏处理原始卫星影像的工作流，下游适配通常保留原始编码器的全部复杂性，限制了实际部署。

Method: 集成三个核心组件：自动化数据整理将原始影像转换为模型就绪数据集；任务特定模型蒸馏获得紧凑高效模型；无缝部署为交互式Web地图应用。

Result: 复现三个已发表研究的数据集，训练模型mIoU差异极小；蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，减少FLOPs和CO2排放；创建更大的作物分割数据集，mIoU达60.65%，比基线提升12个百分点。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署，将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不从根本上依赖频谱峰值，挑战了该领域的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发更透明可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了检测器可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Conclusion: CHEST损失通过结合双曲和欧几里得空间的代理损失，成功解决了在双曲空间中应用代理损失的难题，并提高了深度度量学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于眼源性异常头位姿势的自动诊断，以及基于课程学习的插补框架用于处理临床数据缺失问题，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位姿势（AHP）是斜视等眼部错位疾病的代偿机制，早期诊断可减少并发症。但当前临床评估主要依赖主观判断，且医疗记录不完整，需要自动化诊断和缺失数据处理方法。

Method: 1. AHP-CADNet：多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿势特征和结构化临床属性进行可解释预测；2. 基于课程学习的插补框架，逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床笔记增强诊断鲁棒性。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测误差低（MAE 0.103-0.199，R2 > 0.93）。插补框架在所有临床变量上保持高准确率（93.46-99.78%），临床依赖建模显著改善性能（p < 0.001）。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据恢复均表现出有效性，为眼源性异常头位姿势的客观评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Conclusion: 同时考虑视觉和语音内容的多模态方法能有效提升脚本驱动视频摘要的性能，扩展的数据集为多模态视频摘要研究提供了支持。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: ARGUS提出了一种新的肝癌组织学分型方法，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，实现了最先进的肝癌分型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝细胞癌和肝内胆管癌是消化系统中最异质性和预后差异最大的癌症，其全切片图像包含丰富的层次结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示信息，但现有方法未能充分利用这些关键特征，导致分型性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS首先构建微几何特征来表示细胞级精细模式，然后设计分层视野对齐模块来建模宏观和中观层次交互，最后通过几何先验引导融合策略将增强的微几何和视野特征融合为联合表示。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型中达到了最先进的性能，为临床实践提供了有效的诊断工具。

Conclusion: ARGUS通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的层次信息，结合几何特征建模，显著提升了肝癌组织学分型的准确性和可靠性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的管道，利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型将人物从参考图像插入到背景场景中，实现真实的人物插入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物位置确定和个性化处理视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的相互联系，且通常依赖训练来实现高性能。

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导实现感知全局编辑，并提出掩码引导的自注意力机制来保证高质量的个性化。

Result: 在多样化的合成场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和主体身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身就具备将人物放置在复杂场景中的知识，无需特定任务训练即可实现真实的人物插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于古典音乐会多摄像机录像自动编辑的多模态架构，通过分解为"何时剪辑"和"如何剪辑"两个子任务，在剪辑点检测和视觉镜头选择方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍未被充分探索，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本研究专注于解决古典音乐会多摄像机录像的编辑挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积-变换器管道整合音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征进行时间分割；使用CLIP编码器更新空间选择，并将干扰选择限制在同一音乐会的片段中。

Result: 模型在检测剪辑点方面优于先前基线，在视觉镜头选择方面具有竞争力，推进了多模态自动化视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解编辑任务并改进多模态架构，在自动化视频编辑方面取得了进展，特别是在古典音乐会录像编辑场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

Motivation: 研究R. solani接种对莴苣种子发芽和早期发育的影响，并验证低成本成像系统与先进计算工具结合进行表型分析的可行性。

Method: 使用低成本图像监测系统连续捕获感染组和对照组发芽过程图像，开发了结合形态和空间特征的新型图像分析流程，采用时间整合方法考虑发育历史来识别个体幼苗。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低了发芽率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在密集交织生长等挑战性场景下表现出高准确性，决定系数达0.98，均方根误差为1.12。

Conclusion: 成功证明了低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性、可扩展表型数据获取的可行性，时间整合方法在传统分割技术失效的复杂条件下特别有效。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过将视觉对象视为视觉等价于语言中的单词，使用对象级掩码建模来增强视觉模型的语义理解能力，从而缩小视觉模型与语言模型在推理和上下文学习能力上的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习能力上落后于语言模型，作者认为这源于视觉Transformer训练方案中缺乏语义和上下文指导，而语言模型通过单词建模自然学习真实分布。

Method: 提出将视觉对象作为视觉等价于单词的概念，在掩码图像建模框架中，对视觉对象而非随机图像块进行掩码，强制模型学习视觉元素之间的全局上下文和语义关系。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而像素平均捷径在没有对象级表示时往往被学习。在多模态大语言模型的视觉问答任务上展现出强大的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的有效方向，能够显著提升视觉模型的语义理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时，难以准确控制年龄同时保持身份特征，且微调通常需要昂贵的跨年龄配对图像。

Method: 利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix矩阵融合技术的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，实现高质量中间年龄肖像生成。

Result: AgeBooth能从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的真实且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需大量年龄标注数据就能有效控制年龄的方法，在年龄编辑任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效生成多样化的合成图像和像素级标签，显著提升下游任务的性能

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有合成图像检测研究主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽视了同样重要的跨视觉域泛化问题。需要开发能够同时应对这两种泛化挑战的检测器。

Method: 提出了FusionDetect方法，利用CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结的基础模型提取互补特征，构建统一的特征空间来适应生成器内容和设计的变化。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准测试中比最接近的竞争对手准确率高3.87%，平均精度高6.13%；在OmniGen基准上准确率提升4.48%，并对常见图像扰动具有出色的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了性能最佳的检测器，还引入了新的基准测试框架，为推进通用AI图像检测提供了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 室外LiDAR点云的手动实例分割标注成本极高且耗时，现有方法仍需人工标注。为了完全消除对标注的依赖，开发无监督的LiDAR实例分割方法。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行语义监督。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到最先进性能，mAP达到50.95%，甚至超过了使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法（48.42%）。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了无需任何标注即可实现高质量的LiDAR实例分割，为无监督3D视觉任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多级级联架构，查询图像和商品在不同阶段的表示存在差异，导致难以在用户体验和转化率之间达到帕累托最优。

Method: 提出基于VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）的端到端生成框架，通过多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持视觉相似性先验的同时有效整合用户特定信息。

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用不可靠标签数据源，通过考虑数据源可靠性的加权训练策略，提升了深度学习模型在遥感图像分类中的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为单一编码器，仅依赖其最终层表示进行检测，这种做法的有效性值得质疑。

Method: 利用预训练模型中间层的表示多样性，引入基于熵的准则自动识别提供最互补信息的层，在无需训练和OOD数据的情况下选择性整合这些中间表示。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了OOD检测的新途径，并揭示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督深度学习方法，用于在心脏磁共振图像中检测五个关键帧，包括收缩末期和舒张末期，以及三个额外关键帧，实现跨患者的心脏动态时间对齐分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法深入了解心肌运动模式，且个体心脏周期差异使自动时间比较复杂化。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，通过密集可变形配准场计算一维运动描述符，从特征曲线中基于简单规则确定关键帧。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上验证，相比基于容积的方法，检测精度提升30%-51%（短轴）和11%-47%（四腔长轴），平均循环帧差低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现不受周期或相位长度影响的心脏动态时间对齐分析，为心脏功能评估提供了更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个新颖的框架，通过引入光流运动先验来解决基于LLM的长视频理解问题，在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时间和空间内容冗余的挑战，而多模态大语言模型的上下文长度有限。现有方法依赖CLIP模型作为语义先验提取关键信息，但忽略了运动信息的重要性。

Method: Flow4Agent包含两个核心模块：时间粒度优化(TGO)通过粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景信息；运动令牌剪枝(MTP)利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频令牌。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%，特别在小时级视频理解任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过结合运动先验有效缓解了长视频的冗余问题，在长视频理解任务中超越了现有方法，证明了运动信息在视频理解中的重要性。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS是一种基于多模态数据的生物自动机器学习模型，通过神经架构搜索自动学习最佳网络结构，结合图像和元数据进行昆虫分类，在多个数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等问题，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出BioAutoML-NAS模型，使用多模态数据（图像和元数据），应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个单元内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略，并使用零操作移除不重要连接。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，分别比现有最优方法提升约16%、10%和8%；在Insects-1M数据集上达到93.25%准确率、93.71%精确率、92.74%召回率和93.22% F1分数。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS能够提供准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成领域带来革命性进步，但其基于离散token预测的生成方式与之前的GAN或扩散模型不同，给合成图像检测带来新挑战。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D³QE)方法，通过动态码本频率统计集成到注意力机制中，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Result: 实验表明D³QE在不同AR模型上具有优越的检测精度和强泛化能力，对真实世界扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D³QE方法有效利用自回归生成图像的独特特征，为AR生成图像检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出弱监督上下文学习(WS-ICL)，使用弱提示(如边界框或点)替代密集标签，显著减少医学图像分割的标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用医学图像分割模型(交互式和上下文学习)需要大量标注，交互式模型需要重复用户提示，ICL依赖密集像素级标签，标注成本高。

Method: 提出WS-ICL范式，利用弱提示(边界框、点等)作为上下文，无需精细掩码和所有图像的重复用户提示。

Result: 在三个基准测试上，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的同时，达到与常规ICL模型相当的性能，在交互范式下也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是实现更高效统一医学图像分割通用模型的有前景的一步。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Motivation: 现有工业异常检测研究主要关注制造场景，其姿态受控且对象类别有限，而零售物流中的异常检测面临对象姿态和外观多样性的新挑战，现有方法在此场景下表现不佳。

Method: 构建了一个包含超过23万张图像、2.9万个缺陷实例和4.8万个不同对象的大规模数据集，并对多种最先进的异常检测方法进行了广泛评估。

Result: 现有最先进方法在该数据集上的AUROC得分不超过56.96%，远低于在制造场景数据集上的表现（可达99.9%），表明现有方法难以处理姿态和外观变化较大的场景。

Conclusion: 该研究为零售物流异常检测设立了新的基准，揭示了现有方法的局限性，鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统性地比较了MetaFormer架构中不同token mixer在医学影像任务中的表现，发现对于分类任务，低复杂度token mixer足够；对于分割任务，卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在自然图像领域已被广泛研究，但在医学影像中的应用仍较少，且缺乏对不同token mixer的系统比较，可能忽略了更适合医学影像的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三种token mixer，在8个医学影像数据集上评估图像分类和语义分割任务，并研究从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度token mixer（如分组卷积或池化）表现足够；预训练权重即使在新token mixer中仍有效。分割任务中卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积是最佳选择。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务中token mixer的选择需根据任务类型：分类任务适合低复杂度token mixer，分割任务需要卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置，分组卷积在性能和效率间取得最佳平衡。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态成分分析(MCA)使用预定义的不相干字典，无法适应视频场景内容变化的动态特性，需要开发数据驱动的自适应字典学习方法。

Method: 扩展MCA算法，引入动态模式分解特征值聚类技术，获得数据驱动的MCA字典，形成DMCA方法。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA的去噪效果，成功增强了微弱目标的信噪比，并在逆合成孔径雷达图像中分离了自行车和风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的自适应字典学习，有效处理视频中动态变化的场景内容，在多种应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Motivation: 随着基于扩散的图像生成和编辑技术的兴起，这些强大的生成模型对现有的鲁棒水印方案构成了新的威胁，需要研究其对水印安全性的影响。

Method: 提出扩散驱动的图像再生过程，并引入一种新颖的引导扩散攻击，在生成过程中明确针对水印信号，显著降低水印可检测性。

Result: 在多个最先进的水印方案（StegaStamp、TrustMark、VINE）上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性漏洞，在生成AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Motivation: 利用社交媒体图像补充传统冰雹传感器，实现更快、更详细的恶劣天气评估。

Method: 使用474张奥地利冰雹事件的众包图像，比较四种模型，采用单阶段和两阶段提示策略，后者利用图像中的参考物体（如人手）作为尺寸线索。

Result: 预训练模型已具备从图像测量冰雹直径的潜力，最佳模型平均绝对误差为1.12cm，两阶段提示提高了大多数模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 现成模型无需微调即可从社交媒体图像中提取有意义信息，补充传统传感器，但实时图像采集仍是待解决的问题。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习场景下图像描述任务中的灾难性遗忘问题，以及随时间推移视觉概念与语言对齐的困难。

Method: 基于预训练的ViT-GPT-2架构，结合交叉熵损失与三个额外组件：基于提示的余弦相似度损失、CLIP风格损失和语言引导对比损失。

Result: 该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，无需推理时额外开销即可实现更好的语义对齐和遗忘缓解。

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

*An Thi Nguyen,Radina Stoykova,Eric Arazo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在刑事调查中能大幅减少分析监控录像的人工成本，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能识别特定个体，引发隐私担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决通用实例搜索模型意外涌现的个人识别能力，这种能力可能被用于个人身份识别和画像，而目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失，通过实验验证这些方法在降低人员重识别准确率方面的效果。

Result: 结合两种方法可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞，如使用部分人物图像可能绕过防护。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统？以及应要求哪些技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when
using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted
architectures. Finally, a unified toolkit including a standardized training and
evaluation protocol is introduced to foster reproducibility and enable fair
comparison in NAS research. Overall, this work opens a pathway towards
systematically exploring the full spectrum of neural architectures with a
unified graph-based NAS perspective.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMiner通过迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频构建层次树结构，结合T-GRPO强化学习方法精确定位关键帧，解决了长视频理解中冗余信息干扰和复杂层次结构适应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1) 如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2) 如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构；引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法，指导VideoMiner探索并精确定位关键帧。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，T-GRPO意外地激励模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO方法有效解决了长视频理解的关键挑战，在保持时间连贯性的同时提高了理解准确性和效率。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D可变形模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既能保持高质量又能高效计算的方法。

Method: 结合逐顶点神经场优化和动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，使用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视角设置中达到最先进性能，在多视角场景中保持高度竞争力，同时大幅减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性好的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，为3D人脸重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将医学领域特定的视觉语言模型MedFlamingo与PPO结合，在腹腔镜手术任务中显著提升了性能，相比标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉观察的机器人腹腔镜手术任务中PPO面临的挑战：高维视觉输入、奖励稀疏性以及从原始视觉数据中提取任务相关特征的困难。

Method: 集成MedFlamingo（医学领域特定的视觉语言模型）与PPO，每个episode处理一次任务观察和指令以生成高级规划令牌，将医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈有效结合。

Result: 在LapGym的五个不同腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO表现优于基线方法，收敛速度更快，所有环境的任务成功率均超过70%，相比基线改进幅度从66.67%到1114.29%。

Conclusion: 专业医学知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，该方法成功地将医学领域知识与强化学习相结合。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPTCHA作为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准，研究发现逐步推理对解决CAPTCHA至关重要，现有商业模型表现不佳（准确率约21.9%）。论文提出CAPTCHA-X基准和基于推理的VLM框架，将准确率提升至83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA已从人机识别工具演变为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。研究发现当前商业VLMs在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，需要系统性研究推理能力的重要性。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，涵盖7类CAPTCHA，包含逐步动作解决方案和基础标注。定义5个面向推理的评估指标，并提出基于代理VLM的通用框架，利用模型固有推理能力。

Result: 现有商业VLMs（如Gemini、Claude、GPT等）在CAPTCHA任务上准确率仅约21.9%。提出的方法在5类高难度CAPTCHA上达到83.9%的平均准确率，显著超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性，逐步推理能显著提升模型在复杂空间任务中的表现。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的视觉解释，在多个数据集上优于或与现有方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法主要依赖注意力权重，但这些权重往往产生噪声图，因为它们捕捉的是每层内的token间交互。需要一种能过滤噪声、产生更忠实解释的方法。

Method: 将注意力图与统计过滤相结合，去除噪声或信息量低的模式，生成更忠实的解释。还扩展了类特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该方法能产生更清晰和可解释的图。除了基于扰动的忠实度指标外，还结合人类注视数据评估与人类感知的一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个数据集上始终优于或与现有最先进方法相当，同时保持高效和人类可理解性，强调了人类可解释性对XAI的重要性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT机制在文本任务中表现良好，但在视频推理中往往导致性能下降，产生误导性的内部独白和幻觉视觉细节，这种现象被称为"视觉思维漂移"。

Method: 提出Visual Evidence Reward(VER)强化学习框架，明确奖励基于视觉证据生成的可验证推理轨迹。

Result: 在10个不同的视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER始终达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能够将推理牢固建立在视觉证据上的AI模型，实现"思考时观看"的能力。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Motivation: 尽管有TotalSegmentator等先进分割框架，但左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的精确分割在医学影像中仍是重大挑战，需要高质量的分割数据集来推动相关研究。

Method: 使用专门为高分辨率左心耳分割开发的最先进分割框架，在带有医学专家手动标注的大型私有数据集上训练网络，然后将模型迁移到ImageCAS数据；冠状动脉标注从原始ImageCAS注释改进，肺静脉分割从TS输出细化。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了首个开源的高质量心脏结构分割数据集，特别关注左心耳形态分析，为相关医学影像研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于张量的高光谱图像超分辨率方法只能有效利用一个或两个级别的先验，同时融入多级先验会增加模型复杂性，难以平衡不同先验的权重和优化多块结构。

Method: 使用块项分解将潜在高空间-光谱分辨率图像分解为光谱子空间和空间映射，将空间映射堆叠为空间张量，通过非凸模式混洗张量相关总变分共同建模高阶空间低秩性和平滑性先验，并设计了基于线性化交替方向乘子法的高效优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够紧凑地表征高光谱图像的多级先验，在张量框架下有效解决了高光谱图像超分辨率问题。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生存分析模型难以解释，降低了在临床环境中的实用性。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽视了肿瘤的全局背景，与基因组数据缺乏语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI的全局和局部特征与基因组数据。包含三个创新：稳健的表型表示、指数原型更新策略(EMA ProtoUp)、分层原型匹配方案。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上的评估表明，该方法在准确性和可解释性方面均优于当前领先的单模态和多模态生存预测技术。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，实现了可追溯和可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Conclusion: SSGNet是缓解医学图像分析中标注瓶颈、提高鲁棒性的实用策略。

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将视频引用对象分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，利用预训练文本到视频模型的优势，通过语言引导的变形从视频整体表示直接生成目标掩码，在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'定位-分割'流水线中的信息瓶颈问题，避免语义简化为粗糙几何提示，并改善时间一致性，因为分割过程通常与初始语言基础解耦。

Method: 将RVOS重新定义为条件连续流问题，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形，而不是传统的从噪声到掩码生成或直接预测掩码。

Result: 在所有主要RVOS基准测试中达到新的最先进结果：MeViS上J&F为51.1（比之前SOTA提高1.6），零样本Ref-DAVIS17上为73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS的一阶段生成方法有效克服了传统方法的根本局限性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Motivation: 解决在多样化场景中缺乏3D手部标注数据的问题，需要从单张图像预测双手的3D运动和关节。

Method: 设计标注流程，使用扩散模型将2D手部关键点序列提升为4D手部运动；预测模型采用扩散损失来处理手部运动分布的多模态性。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，使用推算标签的多样化数据训练带来14%提升，提升模型效果提高42%，预测模型性能提升16.4%，在零样本泛化到日常图像方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在双手3D运动预测方面显著优于现有基线方法，特别是在零样本泛化能力上表现突出。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频条件4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视图一致的外观，需要解决时间一致性和动态建模的挑战。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时序注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，以增强时间稳定性。

Result: 在多样化野外视频上，该方法相比基线提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式，准确捕捉了非刚性运动、体积变化和拓扑转换。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了端到端的视频到4D形状生成，在时间一致性和动态建模方面表现出色，为动态3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Conclusion: 生成式世界模型为自动驾驶测试和模型改进提供了高效解决方案，能够以低成本扩展自动驾驶服务到新的运营场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型难以融入精细的相机元数据（如光圈设置），无法实现可控的镜头模糊效果。

Method: 模拟物理成像过程：首先生成全焦图像，估计单目深度，用新型焦点距离变换器预测焦点距离，然后使用可微分镜头模糊模型形成散焦图像。通过反向传播学习散焦效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现更精细的控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在推理时实现了对散焦效果的精确交互控制，同时保持场景内容，这是现有扩散模型无法实现的。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，使用三个预训练视觉模块替代深度传感器，在TUM RGB-D基准测试中达到RGB-D级别的精度，运行速度为22 FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发不依赖深度传感器但能达到RGB-D级别精度的实时SLAM系统，以降低系统成本和复杂性。

Method: 使用三个预训练视觉模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习的关键点检测器和实例分割网络；通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态对象；将静态关键点分配预测深度值并反投影到3D形成度量尺度特征；使用未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端进行跟踪和建图。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4厘米，动态序列为1.8厘米，匹配或超越最先进的RGB-D方法，单GPU上运行速度为22 FPS。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，标志着向更简单、更具成本效益的SLAM系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一人称视角视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集Blender渲染的合成视频和真实世界录制视频，确保场景和动作在视觉和时间上对齐，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日间增强的夜间自动标注引擎并通过人工验证进行精炼。

Result: EgoNight-VQA包含90个视频中的3658个QA对，涵盖12种问答类型，评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型从白天转移到夜间时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的第一人称视角视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的单阶段前馈框架，可从单目视频实时在线重建4D人体-场景，在单次前向传递中同时恢复多人SMPL-X身体、密集3D场景和相机轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代接触感知优化以及严重依赖预处理（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM）的问题，实现更高效、统一的重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，使用参数高效的视觉提示调优，在保持丰富时空先验的同时直接输出多个SMPL-X身体，实现单阶段前馈重建。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上仅训练一天，即可实现实时重建（15 FPS），内存占用低（8 GB），在全局人体运动估计、局部人体网格恢复、视频深度估计和相机姿态估计等任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R提供了一个简单而强大的基线，可作为统一模型消除繁重依赖和迭代优化，易于扩展到下游应用。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TTI扩散模型在内容创作中的影响力日益增强，需要评估它们准确描绘历史背景的能力，而现有研究主要关注人口统计和文化偏见，历史背景的准确呈现尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了HistVis数据集，包含3万张由三种最先进扩散模型生成的合成图像，使用精心设计的提示词描绘不同历史时期的普遍人类活动。评估包括三个方面：隐含风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示。

Result: 研究发现TTI模型在生成历史主题图像时存在系统性不准确，经常通过融入未说明的风格线索来刻板化过去时代，引入时代错误，且未能反映合理的人口统计模式。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估生成图像中的历史表示提供了可扩展的方法和基准，是构建更准确历史和文化对齐的TTI模型的初步步骤。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

Conclusion: 提出的基于信息状态方法的对话管理模型能够有效提升任务导向对话系统的规划能力，通过中间信息构建和有限状态管理实现了更好的对话性能。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

Method: 使用监督学习方法，基于25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型（分别有6层和10层隐藏层，训练500个epoch），在7个MT系统的1000个输出上与人工参考翻译进行比较。

Result: 开发的评估指标在人类相关性方面优于其他可用指标，表明该方法对古吉拉特语机器翻译评估有效。

Conclusion: 成功开发了专门针对古吉拉特语的机器翻译评估指标，填补了印度语言MT评估的空白，为古吉拉特语MT系统性能评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

Motivation: 现有研究要么将幻觉视为需要最小化的工程缺陷，要么论证其理论必然性，但都不足以应对AGI的需求。本文旨在从泛化问题的角度重新理解幻觉现象。

Method: 基于封闭世界和开放世界假设分析幻觉问题，开发了幻觉分类方法，区分可纠正和不可避免的幻觉类型。

Result: 在开放世界条件下，某些类型的幻觉是不可避免的，这反映了LLM泛化能力的结构性限制。

Conclusion: 幻觉不应仅仅被视为工程缺陷，而应作为与人类智能兼容的结构性特征来容忍和管理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

TL;DR: CARE框架通过强化认知推理来提升情感支持对话的质量，无需依赖大规模合成数据，使用强化学习优化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数据增强和合成语料构建，但忽视了支撑有效情感支持的深层认知推理过程。

Method: 利用原始情感支持对话训练集引导模型生成逻辑连贯的支持性回复，并采用强化学习来精炼和加强推理过程。

Result: 实验结果显示CARE显著提高了回复的逻辑合理性和支持性质量。

Conclusion: CARE推动了具有同理心、认知稳健且类人化的情感支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

TL;DR: MADS是一个通过智能体自我博弈生成多轮说服性对话的框架，包含用户代理、对话代理和优化代理，无需人工标注即可生成训练数据，在实际营销场景中将小模型的有机流量转化率提升了22.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行业关键挑战：用户数据缺乏、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，通过低成本生成训练数据来提升对话系统的说服能力。

Method: 使用三个协调的智能体：模拟多样化用户行为的用户代理、执行任务导向说服策略的对话代理，以及评估和优化对话结果的优化代理，通过智能体自我博弈生成多轮对话。

Result: 在实际营销场景中，MADS显著提升了小语言模型的说服能力，将有机流量转化率从1.83%提高到2.24%，提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS框架能够有效生成高质量的说服性对话数据，显著提升语言模型在真实业务场景中的表现，具有明确的商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

TL;DR: IDIOMoE模型将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的原生方言，通过分离文本专家和物品专家的混合专家架构，在保持预训练模型文本理解能力的同时实现强大的推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤的预测准确性和LLM的表达推理能力，满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释的期望，但协同信号语义不透明而LLM难以建模隐式用户偏好。

Method: 在预训练LLM的每个块中将前馈网络拆分为文本专家和物品专家，使用token类型门控避免模态间破坏性干扰，将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的方言。

Result: IDIOMoE在公共和专有数据集上均表现出强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功统一了协同过滤和LLM的优势，为现代推荐系统提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

TL;DR: 通过监督微调可以改进LLMs的不确定性表达能力，但不同元认知技能需要多任务训练才能共同提升，单一任务训练无法相互迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在决策场景中应用增多，但缺乏低置信度信号可能导致用户错误依赖错误输出，需要改进其不确定性表达能力。

Method: 对两种LLMs在通用知识、数学和开放式知识数据集上进行微调，评估单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较两种元认知任务，并测试在医疗和法律推理领域的泛化能力。

Result: 微调改善了校准（置信度与准确性的对齐）和区分度（正确回答的置信度更高），但准确率不变。多任务微调在跨域评估中表现更好。

Conclusion: LLMs的不确定性表达能力是可训练的且具有泛化性，但不同元认知技能需要多任务训练才能相互促进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

TL;DR: 提出基于BERT的自动化管道，用于从图片描述中提取和排序内容信息单元(CIU)，以评估认知语言障碍，在CIU检测上达到93%精确率和96%召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图片描述的认知语言障碍自动评估方法忽视了视觉叙事路径，即说话者描述图片中元素的顺序和位置。传统的手动标记或基于词典的方法效率低下。

Method: 使用基于BERT的管道，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，从Cookie Theft图片描述中自动提取和排序CIU，采用5折交叉验证评估。

Result: CIU检测中位数精确率93%，召回率96%，序列错误率24%。提取的特征与真实值有强Pearson相关性，在外部验证中优于基于词典的基线，在ANCOVA评估组间差异时与手动标注相当。

Conclusion: 该管道能有效表征用于认知障碍评估的视觉叙事路径，实现和模型已开源。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

Motivation: 在大规模评估中，题目与内容标准的准确对齐对于分数解释的有效性至关重要。

Method: 1. 提取嵌入向量并训练经典监督机器学习模型，研究降维对性能的影响；2. 微调8个BERT模型及其变体进行领域和技能对齐；3. 探索多数投票和堆叠集成学习方法。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐上获得最高加权平均F1分数0.950，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐上获得最高F1分数0.869。集成模型未能超越最佳语言模型，降维提升了基于嵌入向量的线性分类器性能但不如语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动化题目与内容标准对齐的不同方法，为大规模评估提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效ICL方法通过将上下文分块处理来应对transformer的二次输入复杂度，但不同分块策略往往导致信息冗余或欠表示，造成性能次优。

Method: 提出Sub-CP框架，利用子模目标控制块多样性，支持从全局多样性到局部一致性的灵活选择策略，同时支持预计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在不同模型规模上都能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP通过精细控制语义结构，有效解决了ICL中的信息冗余问题，为高效上下文选择提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start项目员工在GoEngage平台上因专业术语、系统特定命名以及词汇搜索的局限性而难以定位合适任务模块。

Method: 采用混合语义搜索方法：轻量级容错词汇检索、嵌入向量相似性匹配、约束性大语言模型重排序，并利用现有任务库和知识库基础设施。

Result: 提供完整实施框架，包括资源需求、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议（Hit@K、Precision@K、Recall@K、MRR）和在线测量方法。

Conclusion: 该系统具有低误报率、适应术语变化的可演进性、通过智能缓存和优雅降级机制实现的经济高效性。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)方法，通过集合式全局损失和自监督二分匹配来保持推理路径的多样性，在并行推理中优于传统SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在鼓励推理路径多样性时会牺牲准确性，因为触发多样且正确推理模式的分叉标记通常位于采样树的深层。

Method: 将并行推理视为集合式下一个标记预测问题，在SFT中引入基于集合的全局损失，使用自监督二分匹配将全局分叉标记与唯一推理轨迹对应。

Result: SSFT在多个推理基准测试中，在Pass@1和Cons@k指标下均一致优于传统SFT方法。

Conclusion: SSFT方法能有效保持推理模式的多样性，产生涌现的全局分叉标记，在并行推理中取得更好性能。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究探讨了合成数据比例对模型性能的影响，发现20%以下合成数据可保持稳定性能，30%以上性能加速下降，大模型对合成数据更具鲁棒性，校准退化是早期预警信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解合成数据比例如何影响不同规模模型的行为，为实践者提供合成数据使用的指导原则。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个不同任务上，评估1-3次训练迭代中合成数据比例从0-50%的影响。

Result: 模型在20%合成数据下性能稳定，超过30%性能加速下降；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率下降；推理任务比检索任务退化更快。

Conclusion: 当前最佳实践（如STaR和Self-Instruct系统保持80%以上外部数据）处于安全范围内，研究为实践者提供了基于模型规模和任务需求的合成数据使用指南。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Motivation: 现代大语言模型在客观任务上表现出色，但在评估创造力等主观任务时表现不佳，需要个性化评估方法。

Method: 使用好奇心驱动的LLM作为评估者，学习个体对创意写作的主观判断，在Torrance创造性思维测试基准上进行验证。

Result: 该方法使不同规模的模型能够学习不同个体的细微创意判断，在皮尔逊相关性、Cohen's和F1值等指标上优于基线监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于评估者意见不一致的主观评估场景，能够有效捕捉个体化的创意判断。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

TL;DR: WebDetective是一个用于评估RAG系统和网络代理的多跳深度搜索任务的基准，它解决了现有基准中推理路径泄露和评估指标单一的问题，通过无提示问题和可控维基百科沙箱实现完全可追溯性，并提供了分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统和网络代理在多跳深度搜索任务评估中存在两个主要问题：1) 大多数基准在问题文本中泄露了推理路径，导致模型依赖表面线索而非自主发现推理链；2) 评估通常简化为单一通过率，掩盖了失败的具体原因（搜索不足、知识利用差或不适当拒绝）。

Method: 开发了WebDetective基准，包含无提示的多跳问题和可控的维基百科沙箱，确保模型行为的完全可追溯性。同时提出了一个整体评估框架，分离评估搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为。

Result: 对25个最先进模型的评估显示所有架构都存在系统性弱点：模型在拥有充分证据时仍难以有效利用知识，在缺乏证据时几乎不会适当拒绝。这些模式暴露了当前系统的根本差距：擅长执行给定推理路径，但在需要自主发现时失败。

Conclusion: 开发了EvidenceLoop代理工作流程，通过验证循环和系统证据跟踪来改进搜索和综合能力。WebDetective的诊断框架能够指导具体的架构改进，使其成为开发真正自主推理系统而非模式跟随代理的关键工具。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Motivation: 科学文献快速增长使得文献综述难以保持全面和及时更新，现有方法主要关注检索和筛选阶段，而综述写作阶段的可读性和事实准确性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用多智能体协作工作流，包含内容提纲、子章节写作、编辑和审阅等专门化智能体，模拟人类文献综述过程。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of

*Hamed Jelodar,Mohammad Meymani,Parisa Hamedi,Tochukwu Emmanuel Nwankwo,Samita Bai,Roozbeh Razavi-Far,Ali A. Ghorbani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLD-LLM是一个评估语言模型生成源代码描述能力的NLP框架，通过精心设计的提示工程，发现较小模型在良好提示下也能表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统评估语言模型在自然语言描述任务中生成准确简洁源代码描述的能力。

Method: 提出NLD-LLM框架，整合多种Transformer模型，采用标准化格式、清晰任务指导和NLD提示的全面提示设计策略，并进行迭代优化。

Result: 分析显示提示工程显著影响模型效果，较小模型在精心设计的提示支持下也能表现出色。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示工程可以显著提升语言模型在自然语言描述任务中的表现，使较小模型具备竞争力。

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

### [95] [To model human linguistic prediction, make LLMs less superhuman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05141)
*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在预测人类阅读行为方面表现不佳，因为它们比人类拥有更强的长期和短期记忆能力，导致预测过于准确而无法准确模拟人类阅读困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为人类语言预测的认知模型，但发现随着模型预测能力的提升，其预测人类阅读行为的能力反而下降。

Method: 分析LLMs与人类在语言预测方面的差异，识别导致模型"超人类"表现的两个主要因素：长期记忆和短期记忆能力。

Result: 当前主流LLMs在语言理解方面表现出超人类能力，无法准确预测人类阅读困难，因为它们的记忆能力远超人类。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有人类水平长期和短期记忆的模型，并改进人类实验数据来评估这类模型的进展。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

*Xin Wang,Anshu Raj,Matthew Luebbe,Haiming Wen,Shuozhi Xu,Kun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取流程，从实验报告材料中捕获47个特征，涵盖成分、加工、微观结构和性能，实现高精度、低遗漏的文献挖掘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决材料发现中大量信息被困在非结构化文献中的问题，现有提取方法特征有限且未能整合成分-加工-微观结构-性能关系，难以构建全面数据库。

Method: 采用多阶段信息提取流程，集成迭代提取与来源追踪，使用大语言模型从实验报告材料中提取47个特征。

Result: 特征级和元组级F1分数约0.96，微观结构类别F1分数提升10.0%-13.7%，遗漏材料从49个减少到13个（遗漏率从12.4%降至3.3%）。

Conclusion: 该流程可实现可扩展、高效的文献挖掘，生成高精度、低遗漏的数据库，为机器学习和材料信息学提供可靠输入，模块化设计适用于多种材料类别。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SynCED-EnDe数据集，这是一个用于机器翻译关键错误检测的新资源，包含1000个黄金标注和8000个白银标注的句子对，在错误和非错误案例之间保持50/50的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WMT21英德CED数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面存在局限性，需要更全面和平衡的数据集来改进机器翻译的关键错误检测。

Method: 从2024-2025年的多样化来源（StackExchange、GOV.UK）收集数据，引入明确的错误子类、结构化触发标志和细粒度的辅助判断（明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性、充分性偏差）。

Result: 基准实验显示，与WMT21相比，由于平衡的标签和精细的标注，XLM-R及相关编码器的性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe作为社区资源，旨在推进机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手（特别是可穿戴AI设备等新兴场景）中的安全部署。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

*Qi Li,Runpeng Yu,Haiquan Lu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）解码机制的新型模型归属方法，通过提取解码轨迹的结构信息来实现模型识别和归属分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs的双向解码机制不仅提升了模型性能，还包含了丰富的模型特定行为信息，可用于解决模型归属问题，包括区分不同模型以及同一模型的不同检查点。

Method: 提出了定向解码图（DDM）来提取解码步骤间的结构关系，以及高斯轨迹归属（GTA）方法，通过拟合每个解码位置的高斯分布来计算轨迹的似然度作为归属分数。

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够准确识别模型归属。

Conclusion: dLLMs的解码轨迹可作为强大的模型归属工具，DDM和GTA方法能够有效提取和利用结构信息，为模型识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为时序思考的实时对话思考机制，用于改进全双工语音对话语言模型，通过在倾听阶段进行轻量级思考来提高响应质量，而不会增加额外延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工系统在倾听阶段让代理空闲地预测静默标记，这与人类在对话中持续进行轻量级思考的行为不符。

Method: 时序思考机制：1）严格因果性：在倾听过程中增量推理，仅基于过去音频更新内部假设；2）无额外延迟：在倾听窗口内分摊推理，用户停止说话后立即开始响应。

Result: 实验通过客观指标和人工评估显示响应质量持续改善，同时能稳健处理对话动态并在全双工交互指标上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 时序思考为全双工语音对话系统提供了一种有效的实时思考机制，显著提升了响应质量和交互体验。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到金融应用对准确性、可靠性和领域适配的严格要求，需要深入理解金融LLM如何有效设计和评估以辅助金融决策。

Method: 在PIXIU框架下创建FinMA模型，使用金融指令调优数据集进行指令调优，并在FLARE基准下评估模型性能。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在数值推理、实体识别和摘要任务中存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对金融LLM如何有效设计和评估的理解，以支持金融相关决策过程。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large
Language Models (LLMs) in the context of financial natural language processing
(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial
tasks. Recognizing the critical demands of accuracy, reliability, and domain
adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial
Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark.
Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型评估中对示例分隔符的选择会显著影响模型性能，不同分隔符可使MMLU得分波动±23%，甚至能操纵模型排名。模型对分隔符的脆弱性普遍存在且不随规模改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估协议和实际使用中，用户需要选择如何分隔上下文示例，但这种看似次要的选择对模型响应质量的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过在不同模型家族（Llama、Qwen、Gemma）上测试各种分隔符（逗号、换行、分号、井号等）对MMLU等任务的影响，并分析注意力头得分来探究机制。

Result: 分隔符选择能显著改变模型性能，MMLU得分波动可达±23%，可通过仅修改分隔符来操纵模型排名。好分隔符能引导注意力到关键输入token。

Conclusion: LLMs对分隔符选择存在脆弱性，在提示中明确指定分隔符可提高鲁棒性，并提供了最佳分隔符的实用建议。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DeliberationBank数据集和DeliberationJudge模型，用于评估大规模公共审议摘要的质量，解决LLM在审议摘要中可能存在的偏见和少数观点代表性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模公共审议产生大量自由形式贡献，需要生成具有代表性和中立性的摘要供政策制定使用。LLM虽然能生成摘要，但存在少数观点代表性不足和输入顺序偏见等公平性问题，需要大规模评估方法。

Method: 构建DeliberationBank数据集，包含10个审议问题的3000名参与者意见数据，以及4500名参与者在四个维度（代表性、信息性、中立性、政策批准）上的摘要判断数据。基于此训练DeliberationJudge模型，一个微调的DeBERTa模型。

Result: DeliberationJudge比各种LLM评估器更高效且与人类判断更一致。使用该模型评估18个LLM，揭示了审议摘要中的持续弱点，特别是少数立场的代表性不足问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估审议摘要提供了可扩展且可靠的方法，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理过程中产生的幻觉问题，提高模型可靠性。

Method: 通过系统分类和提示工程控制生成不同类型的幻觉，使用嵌入模型将幻觉数据集映射到向量空间，采用无监督学习技术在降维表示中分析幻觉与真实回答。

Result: 定量评估显示，幻觉中信息扭曲的严重程度与其与正确输出簇的空间偏离度存在一致相关性。

Conclusion: 简单分类算法就能可靠地区分单个LLM中的幻觉与准确回答，为提升模型可靠性提供了轻量有效的框架。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准固定温度采样难以平衡探索与利用：高温会降低样本质量，低温限制发现能力。需要一种既能保持样本质量又能确保训练稳定性的探索策略。

Method: EAD采用动态温度调度策略，在序列生成过程中从高温度逐渐降低到低温度，实现"开头探索、结尾利用"的生成模式。

Result: EAD作为轻量级即插即用方法，在各种RLVR算法和模型规模下都显著优于固定温度采样，提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 将探索策略与序列生成的自然动态对齐是提升LLM推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camellia是一个用于评估多语言大模型在9种亚洲语言中文化偏见的基准，包含19,530个文化标注实体和2,173个社交媒体上下文，揭示了LLMs在文化适应、情感关联和实体抽取方面的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言基准，目前不清楚LLMs是否在非西方语言中也存在文化偏见。先前研究表明LLMs在阿拉伯语中偏向西方实体，需要评估亚洲语言中的文化公平性。

Method: 构建Camellia基准，包含9种亚洲语言的19,530个文化标注实体和2,173个社交媒体上下文，评估4个多语言LLM家族在文化语境适应、情感关联和实体抽取QA等任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在所有亚洲语言中都难以进行文化适应，不同模型因文化相关数据访问差异而表现不同；不同LLM家族持有独特偏见，在文化-情感关联上存在差异；LLMs在亚洲语言上下文理解困难，导致实体抽取中的文化性能差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在亚洲语言中存在显著的文化偏见问题，需要更多文化相关数据和改进的跨文化理解能力来提升文化公平性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

TL;DR: LLM安全护栏模型在面对上下文中的额外信息时存在脆弱性，在检索增强生成(RAG)场景下，插入良性文档会导致11%的输入护栏和8%的输出护栏判断改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保LLM系统安全成为迫切需求。外部LLM护栏模型虽然流行，但它们本身也是微调或提示工程的LLM，容易受到数据分布变化的影响。

Method: 以检索增强生成为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guard和2个GPT-oss模型，分析插入良性文档到护栏上下文中的影响，并分别评估了检索文档、用户查询和LLM生成响应等组件的作用。

Result: 插入良性文档会改变输入护栏11%的判断和输出护栏8%的判断，使其不可靠。测试的两种缓解方法仅带来轻微改进。

Conclusion: 当前护栏存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Result: 实验发现稠密检索器在历史术语上表现不佳，LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了复杂社会指标推理的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更稳健的气候档案RAG系统提供了见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为残差相似性(RS)的新方法，通过神经网络补充可解释特征系统，在保持可解释性的同时提高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络方法虽然准确率高，但缺乏直接可解释性，而LLM的预测无法忠实解释推理过程。需要既能保持高精度又具有可解释性的解决方案

Method: 使用神经网络预测可解释系统的相似性残差（误差），将神经网络作为补充而非替代，保持整体系统的可解释性

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能达到最先进作者验证模型的性能，还能展示最终预测的忠实性和可解释程度

Conclusion: 残差相似性方法成功地在保持可解释性的同时提升了系统性能，为需要真实世界决策支持的应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制的二次复杂度随着上下文长度增加成为显著瓶颈，需要探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 对亚二次注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构等方法的计算和内存复杂度、基准测试结果及基本限制进行批判性分析。

Result: 系统评估了各种替代方法的性能表现和局限性，为克服Transformer计算瓶颈提供了全面视角。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer目前仍占主导地位，但这些新兴方法显示出挑战其统治地位的潜力，特别是在处理长序列时。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

TL;DR: 研究发现即使大语言模型能完美检索相关信息，其性能仍会随输入长度增加而显著下降，揭示了一个与检索质量无关的输入长度限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在长上下文任务中性能下降的根本原因，验证即使完美检索情况下性能是否仍会受输入长度影响。

Method: 在数学、问答和编程任务上对5个开源和闭源LLM进行系统实验，包括替换无关标记为空白、强制只关注相关标记等控制条件。

Result: 即使模型能完美检索所有相关信息，当输入长度增加时性能仍会显著下降13.9%-85%，且这种下降与检索质量无关。

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害LLM性能，提出通过让模型在解决问题前复述检索证据的简单缓解策略，在GPT-4o上观察到4%的改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度心理健康沟通存在语言碎片化、文化多样性，且在当前临床NLP中代表性不足。现有的健康本体和心理健康资源主要基于英语或西方文化的诊断框架，无法充分代表印度语言中患者的痛苦表达。

Method: 通过基于图的方法构建跨语言心理健康本体，捕捉文化嵌入的痛苦表达，跨语言对齐，并与临床术语链接。

Result: 该框架能够填补医疗沟通中的关键空白，为AI系统提供文化有效的表征。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言环境下的心理健康护理提供了更具包容性和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Motivation: ICU护理文档存在术语不一致、风格不正式和缺乏标准化的问题，这在心衰护理中尤为关键，需要改进文档质量。

Method: 应用直接偏好优化(DPO)方法，使用MIMIC-III数据库中的8,838条心衰护理记录和21,210个偏好对来微调Mistral-7B模型。

Result: BLEU提升84%(0.173到0.318)，BERTScore提高7.6%(0.828到0.891)，专家评分在准确性(+14.4)、完整性(+14.5)、逻辑一致性(+14.1)、可读性(+11.1)和结构清晰度(+6.0)方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DPO能够使轻量级临床语言模型与专家标准对齐，支持隐私保护的AI辅助文档记录，减轻管理负担并提高ICU患者安全。

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Method: 使用轻量级Llama-3.3 70B Instruct模型构建多智能体系统，包括问题分析、几何建模、代码转换、模型验证和载荷应用等专门智能体。

Result: 在20个基准问题上进行实验评估，系统在大多数情况下达到80%以上的准确率，在10次重复试验中表现优于Gemini-2.5 Pro和ChatGPT-4o模型。

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统成功实现了2D框架有限元建模的自动化，展示了LLM在结构工程中的实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的推理依据常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定偏差，直接作为监督信号会传播噪声并影响训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三个无监督信任指标：自一致性、类别蕴含对齐和LLM一致性评分，构建统一信任分数来加权训练样本，选择性蒸馏LLM生成的推理依据。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确率、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 为专利分析领域建立了一个利用推理感知信任指标的可靠范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Motivation: 人类评估LLM在多轮对话中的表现成本高且难以复现，需要可靠的自动评估方法来替代。

Method: 构建包含909个标注对话的SimulatorArena基准，在数学辅导和文档创建任务上评估各种模拟器方法。

Result: 基于用户配置的模拟器与人类判断高度一致，Spearman相关系数达0.7，可用于评估18个最新LLM助手。

Conclusion: 条件化用户配置的模拟器提供了实用、可扩展的人类评估替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: 基于图监督的多智能体路由方法在问答任务中展现出有效性和鲁棒性，能够捕获不同智能体的互补优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和推理模型在理解对话中的复杂社交现象（如讽刺、反讽）方面存在困难，需要专门的评估工具来识别模型弱点并寻找解决方案。

Method: 构建SoNLI数据集，包含精心挑选的对话转录，配以推理、似然分数和人工编写的解释；通过多步反事实推理评估模型的心智理论能力。

Conclusion: SoNLI数据集能够有效评估模型的心智理论能力，特别是在理解复杂社交现象方面的表现，为改进AI助手的社交能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI
assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand
sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

Conclusion: TensorBLEU作为"Token-ID BLEU"开发工具，为RL模型微调等领域的研究提供了强大的加速工具，并开源实现。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该研究通过为广泛使用的规划基准添加手动标注的细粒度自然语言约束，揭示了LLMs在规划任务中的局限性，表明约束引入会显著降低性能并挑战对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准仅包含通用和简化的环境规范，可能导致高估LLMs的规划能力并在下游任务中引发安全问题，需要更丰富的约束来评估真实规划能力。

Method: 在广泛使用的规划基准上添加手动标注的细粒度自然语言约束，涵盖四个正式定义的类别，通过4个最先进的推理LLMs、3种形式语言、5种方法和4个数据集进行评估。

Result: 约束引入不仅使性能持续减半，还显著挑战了对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要更丰富的约束来准确评估LLMs的真实规划能力，现有基准可能高估其性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

Method: 通过聚类CoT和中性提示的激活差异构建推理原型，在推理时将输入的隐藏状态投影到这些原型上形成实例特定的引导向量。

Result: 在GSM8K、AQuA-RAT和BIG-Bench任务上准确率持续提升，即使在CoT被显式抑制以提升成本效益时，增益仍然存在。

Conclusion: 动态原型引导是一种轻量级替代训练时方法，可增强LLM推理能力，且能强化潜在推理过程而非表面行为转变。

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于皮亚杰建构主义理论的代理记忆系统CAM，用于提升大语言模型在长文档阅读理解中的表现，通过结构化记忆、灵活同化和动态调节来解决信息过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理长文档时面临信息过载的挑战，需要一种连贯的记忆模块来提升阅读能力。现有方法缺乏系统性的设计原则。

Method: 受皮亚杰建构主义理论启发，开发了CAM系统，采用增量重叠聚类算法构建结构化记忆，支持分层摘要和在线批量集成，并在推理时自适应激活查询相关信息。

Result: 与现有方法相比，CAM在问答、查询摘要和声明验证等长文本阅读理解任务中展现出性能和效率的双重优势。

Conclusion: 基于建构主义理论的代理记忆设计为大语言模型的长文档阅读理解提供了更稳健和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中，需要更可靠的知识提取和推理方法，传统文本分块RAG在处理全局系统级洞察方面存在局限。

Method: 构建结构化知识图谱并集成到检索增强生成(RAG)流程中，使用OMIn数据集创建QA基准，评估多种本地可部署LLM模型。

Result: KEO显著改善了全局感知能力，能够揭示模式和系统级洞察，而文本分块RAG在需要局部检索的细粒度程序任务上仍然有效。

Conclusion: 知识图谱增强的LLM在安全、特定领域的问答中具有巨大潜力，特别适用于高风险推理场景。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H1B-KV是一种混合1位KV缓存压缩方案，通过1位二进制草图表示键向量和4位量化值向量，将7B参数LLM的8k上下文缓存内存减少70倍至60MB，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码需要缓存不断增长的KV对，使得长上下文推理成为内存瓶颈问题。现有方法如量化缓存、驱逐令牌或键二进制草图等方法往往不完整，要么保留某些组件未压缩，要么丢弃上下文信息。

Method: 提出混合1位KV缓存(H1B-KV)，使用1位二进制草图表示键向量实现硬件友好的位注意力，同时对值向量进行4位量化，形成完整的压缩方案。

Result: 经过轻量级微调后，H1B-KV在困惑度基准和复杂下游任务（数学推理GSM8K、多任务理解MMLU、代码生成HumanEval）上匹配全精度性能，显著优于现有量化、令牌驱逐和仅键草图方法。

Conclusion: H1B-KV是在内存受限环境中部署LLM的强大解决方案，实现了70倍内存减少而不牺牲上下文信息。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自博弈偏好优化中提示作为核心组件的作用尚未被充分探索，本文旨在研究不同难度提示如何影响自博弈偏好优化性能。

Method: 使用提示的N个采样响应的平均奖励作为难度代理，分析困难提示与简单提示在自博弈优化中的表现差异，并探索缓解困难提示负面影响的策略。

Result: 困难提示的自博弈优化性能显著劣于简单提示，将困难提示纳入训练不仅无法提升整体性能，反而会导致轻微性能下降。模型容量增加时，困难与简单提示的性能差距会缩小。

Conclusion: 选择性移除适当比例的困难提示可以提升整体自博弈性能，提示难度与模型容量存在交互作用，需要根据模型能力调整提示难度策略。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在部署时面临显著的内存和计算挑战，需要有效的压缩方法。

Method: 提出Pareto-Guided SVD (PGSVD)零流水线，通过层间激活压缩误差上界网络损失变化，将低秩压缩建模为双目标优化问题，使用帕累托引导的秩选择和交替最小二乘实现。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上应用PGSVD，在相同压缩水平下获得了更好的准确性和推理加速。

Conclusion: PGSVD框架有效解决了LLM和VLM的部署挑战，在保持性能的同时实现了更好的压缩效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Method: 引入EvoPresent自我改进代理框架，核心是PresAesth多任务强化学习美学模型，提供美学评分、缺陷调整和比较反馈，支持迭代自我改进。

Result: 构建了EvoPresent基准，包含650篇顶级AI会议论文的多模态资源和2000个幻灯片对，验证了高质量反馈对自我改进的重要性，以及多任务RL训练在美学意识任务中的更强泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvoPresent框架通过统一叙事连贯性、美学感知设计和虚拟角色展示，有效解决了学术论文展示的自动化改进问题，多任务强化学习在美学评估中表现出更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

Method: 从关键实体开始构建推理节点，结合深度优先搜索和创新的节点生成技术，通过历史错误分析和实时反馈动态调整推理策略

Conclusion: FGDIP框架通过动态自适应策略有效扩展搜索空间并确保推理过程系统收敛，显著提升了语言代理在多跳推理任务中的性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: EAGLET提供了一种无需人工努力或额外训练数据的高效有效解决方案，显著提升了代理的规划能力

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

Motivation: 隐式属性值提取在电商产品表示中很重要，但现有MLLM模型在处理多维数据和视觉-文本理解差距方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体辩论框架，让多个MLLM智能体通过多轮辩论相互验证和更新推理结果。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论策略能够解决单智能体方法的局限性，为多模态电商中的隐式AVE提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略来平衡压缩效率和模型保真度。

Method: 采用结构化稀疏因子分解，将权重矩阵表示为稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵，利用校准数据集优化因子分解以最小化功能重建误差。

Result: 在多个Llama和Qwen模型上测试，CoSpaDi在20-50%压缩比下在准确性和困惑度方面均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的有力替代方案，为高效LLM部署提供了新的压缩范式。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言上下文学习方法主要依赖单语演示，无法缓解LLMs依赖英语作为潜在表示的翻译障碍，限制了多语言应用的包容性。

Method: CSICL是一种提示策略，在演示和指令中从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，通过受控代码切换为推理过程提供显式支架。

Result: 在4个LLMs、6个数据集和10种语言的实验中，CSICL始终优于基线方法，在目标语言和未见语言上分别提升3.1%和1.9%，在低资源设置下提升更显著(14.7%和5.3%)。

Conclusion: 代码切换是一种原则性且稳健的方法，可在推理过程中克服翻译障碍，推动LLMs向更公平有效的多语言系统发展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is
available at https://github.com/sdsxdxl/DecEx-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发一种生成多源天文观测设施映射的方法论，使用NLP技术和可调整标准计算实体相似度，并利用LLM验证映射建议，最终生成标准化的多源同义词集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为天文观测设施创建统一的多源映射，以支持名称解析API和国际虚拟天文台联盟词汇表的集成，提高数据的可发现性、可访问性、互操作性和可重用性（FAIR原则）。

Method: 结合NLP技术（词袋方法、序列方法和表面方法）和可调整标准计算实体相似度，利用所有可用属性（标签、定义、描述、外部标识符等）以及领域特定属性（观测波段、航天器发射日期、资助机构等），并使用LLM验证映射建议的合理性。

Result: 生成了由多源同义词集组成的映射，每个实体只提供一个标准化标签，这些映射将用于名称解析API并集成到IVOA词汇表和OntoPortal-Astro平台中。

Conclusion: 该方法成功创建了天文观测设施的多源映射，通过LLM验证确保了映射的合理性和FAIR原则的遵循，为天文数据集成和互操作提供了重要基础。

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro
platform.

TL;DR: 本文推导了非渐近谱带，通过对齐度、温度和批次谱来约束InfoNCE梯度范数的平方，恢复了1/τ²定律，并在合成数据和ImageNet上紧密跟踪批次平均梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究InfoNCE损失的梯度特性，特别是其与温度参数、批次数据谱结构的关系，以改进对比学习的训练效率和稳定性。

Method: 使用有效秩作为各向异性代理，设计谱感知批次选择方法，包括快速贪心构建器；并采用批次内白化技术来促进各向同性。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上，Greedy-64相比随机选择将达到67.5% top-1准确率的时间减少了15%，在CIFAR-10上也有类似增益；批次内白化将50步梯度方差降低了1.37倍。

Conclusion: 谱感知批次选择和批次内白化能有效提升对比学习的训练效率和梯度稳定性，理论分析与实验结果一致。

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的抽象文本摘要学习方法，包含两种方法：基于最优传输的信息注意力方法和命名实体累积联合熵减少方法，以提高摘要的信息性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，需要先进的方法将冗长的文本数据转化为简洁、连贯且信息丰富的摘要。尽管已有显著进展，但在信息性方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 1. 基于最优传输的信息注意力方法，改进参考摘要中关键信息的学习；2. 命名实体累积联合熵减少方法，增强信息显著性。

Result: 在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上获得了更好的ROUGE分数，在XSum上具有竞争力的结果。人工评估显示在信息性方面优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了抽象文本摘要的信息性，并通过进一步分析揭示了评估结果背后的合理原因。

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MoNE（Mixture of Neuron Experts）方法，通过神经元级别的专家选择，在保持性能的同时仅激活50%的MoE层参数，显著提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现MoE层在推理时激活的参数高度稀疏，大多数神经元激活值接近零，这启发了选择高激活神经元专家的想法。

Method: 提出MoNE方法，在每个专家内部进行简单的top-k选择，仅激活高激活值的神经元，无需额外路由参数或专家间通信。

Result: MoNE在仅激活50%MoE层参数的情况下与传统MoE性能相当，在相同激活参数数量下持续优于传统MoE。

Conclusion: MoNE是提高MoE类模型参数利用率和推理效率的实用方法。

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于人类反馈的TTS偏好优化方法主要需要utterance级别的配对样本，但这类数据在TTS输出中通常有限，且utterance级表述阻碍了实现准确发音对齐所需的细粒度token级优化。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单元，自动提供细粒度对齐信号，无需token级标注。

Result: TKTO将日语TTS准确率提高39%，CER降低54%，自动为目标token分配12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO通过消除配对数据需求和实现token级优化，有效提升了TTS系统的准确性和数据效率。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEPO是一个增强探索的强化学习框架，通过两阶段生成和自适应遗忘机制解决RLVR中的探索-利用平衡问题，在多个推理基准上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法过度强调利用，导致熵崩溃和探索能力下降，形成自我强化的循环，限制了性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段生成：第一阶段模型生成一半轨迹，然后通过轻量级遗忘步骤暂时抑制这些样本，迫使第二阶段探索输出空间的不同区域。

Result: 在五个推理基准上，EEPO相比GRPO取得显著提升：Qwen2.5-3B提升24.3%，Llama3.2-3B-Instruct提升33.0%，Qwen3-8B-Base提升10.4%。

Conclusion: EEPO通过样本-遗忘机制有效打破自我强化循环，促进更广泛的探索，在RLVR中实现了更好的探索-利用平衡。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要基于英语，导致法语等主要语言性能差距显著，特别是小型语言模型。现有多语言模型在法语上表现远低于英语，且法语高效适配方法研究有限。

Method: 通过精选高质量法语数据进行针对性后训练，并采用策略性模型融合技术。

Result: Luth模型在多个法语基准测试中超越所有同规模开源模型，同时保持原有英语能力，模型融合进一步提升了双语性能。

Conclusion: Luth成为法语小型语言模型的新标杆，为未来法语语言研究提供了稳健基准。

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

Motivation: LLMs在文本摘要方面表现出色，但在专业领域或对话数据上表现不佳，而微调需要昂贵的高质量标注数据，因此需要寻找更可扩展的适应方法。

Conclusion: 持续预训练是提升LLMs在对话摘要任务中性能的有效方法，为工业应用提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

Motivation: 企业面临日益复杂的数字法规合规挑战，特别是中小企业缺乏资源起草复杂法律文件，而自动化合同生成器的质量和普及度缺乏实证证据。

Method: 创建并标注多语言基准数据集，涵盖瑞士和欧盟隐私法的关键合规义务，使用基于GPT-5的新方法进行大规模隐私政策合规性评估。

Result: 观察到合规性提升表明法律修订的效果，使用生成器的网站合规性显著更高，比未使用的高达15个百分点。

Conclusion: 研究为三个议题做出贡献：LLM在跨语言法律分析中的潜力、欧盟法规的布鲁塞尔效应，以及自动化工具在提高合规性和合同质量中的作用。

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文模型容易受到上下文噪声（无关标记）的干扰，这会误导模型注意力，影响预测准确性。

Method: 提出集成梯度(IG)分数来检测和量化上下文噪声，并开发了CDT训练策略，通过减轻检测到的噪声来增强对关键标记的关注。

Result: 在四个任务上的广泛实验表明，CDT在上下文窗口扩展和长上下文对齐设置下都表现出优越性。使用CDT训练的8B开源模型性能(50.92)接近GPT-4o(51.00)。

Conclusion: CDT是一种简单有效的训练策略，能显著提升模型对关键标记的关注度，从而改善后续预测性能。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型的长上下文能力在推理和检索方面已有研究，但在安全关键场景下的行为尚不清楚，需要系统评估其对有害内容的敏感性。

Method: 评估LLaMA-3、Qwen-2.5和Mistral模型，变化有害内容类型（显性vs隐性）、位置（开头、中间、结尾）、占比（0.01-0.50）和上下文长度（600-6000词元）。

Result: 所有模型表现相似：性能在中等有害内容占比（0.25）时达到峰值，当内容过于稀疏或主导时下降；召回率随上下文长度增加而降低；开头位置的有害句子检测更可靠；显性内容比隐性内容识别更一致。

Conclusion: 这为理解LLMs在长上下文中如何优先处理和校准有害内容提供了首个系统视角，既展示了其新兴优势，也指出了安全关键应用中仍面临的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on
extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation.
While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

Motivation: 质疑LSZ关于LLMs在不同语言提示下显示文化特定倾向的研究方法和结论，认为其观察到的模式可能是实验设计和方法论问题导致的假象

Method: 使用更广泛的LLMs和更多测试项目进行针对性复制实验，重新评估提示语言对模型输出的影响

Result: 提示语言对输出的影响极小，挑战了LSZ关于这些模型编码了根深蒂固文化信念的主张

Conclusion: LLMs在不同语言提示下表现出的所谓"文化倾向"并非稳定特征，而是特定实验条件下的脆弱产物，不能证明模型真正编码了文化信念

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于强化学习启发的无参数优化方法开辟了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的文化评估基准往往将文化简化为静态事实或同质化价值观，这与人类学强调文化是动态、历史情境化和实践中体现的观点相冲突，需要更好的评估方法。

Method: 引入四部分框架（知识、偏好、表现、偏见）来分类基准如何框架文化，定性分析20个文化基准，识别六个方法问题，并基于人类学方法提出具体改进建议。

Result: 识别了六个常见方法问题：将国家等同于文化、忽视文化内多样性、依赖过度简化的调查格式等，并提出了包含真实世界叙事、文化社区参与设计和验证等改进方案。

Conclusion: 通过结合人类学方法改进文化基准设计，可以超越静态回忆任务，更准确地评估模型在复杂文化情境中的响应能力。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在不同文化背景下的道德对齐程度，发现模型在西方和非西方地区存在明显的区域偏见。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查（55个国家，19个主题）和PEW全球态度调查（39个国家，8个主题），结合两种评分方法和模型作为评判者的同行评审机制。

Result: 顶级模型与调查结果高度一致（WVS的Pearson's r约0.90），但西方地区平均r=0.82，非西方地区平均r=0.61，存在0.21的绝对差距。同行评审标记了348个冲突。

Conclusion: 研究显示在文化感知AI方面取得真实进展，但跨区域使用仍面临挑战，同行一致性有助于自动质量检查。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型能在内部表征中线性建模数学问题的难度，通过最终Transformer层的特定注意力头实现难度感知，为自动难度标注提供了实用支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否能在内部表征中编码问题难度，这是自适应推理和高效资源分配的关键能力。

Method: 使用线性探针分析LLMs最终token的表征，定位最终Transformer层中具有相反激活模式的特定注意力头。

Result: 数学问题难度可以在LLMs内部表征中被线性建模，特定注意力头对简单和困难问题表现出相反的激活模式。

Conclusion: LLMs中的难度感知不仅存在且具有结构性组织，为自动难度标注和课程学习提供了新的理论见解和实用方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

*Periklis Mantenoglou,Rishi Hazra,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LexiCon是一个基于自然语言的约束规划基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在带约束规划任务中的表现。实验表明，随着任务约束程度的增加，包括GPT-5、o3和R1在内的先进LLM性能会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM主要在无约束规划任务上进行测试，但在需要遵守约束（特别是安全约束）的现实场景中，需要评估它们在约束规划任务上的表现。

Method: LexiCon通过将现有规划环境添加时间约束，然后将这些约束问题转化为自然语言让LLM解决。其关键特性是可扩展性，可以自动为新环境生成时间约束。

Result: 实验发现，随着规划任务约束程度的增加，最先进的LLM（包括推理模型GPT-5、o3和R1）的性能会恶化。

Conclusion: LexiCon提供了一个系统评估LLM约束规划能力的方法，并发现当前LLM在约束规划任务上存在局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

*Timothy Pistotti,Jason Brown,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统性的wh-effect分析发现GPT-2在寄生空位环境中表现出对填充语-空位依赖关系的稳健知识，与之前使用差分法度量的研究结果形成对比，表明评估指标的选择对判断LLM句法能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对先前研究使用不同评估指标（直接最小对比较vs差分法）得出关于大语言模型学习复杂句法能力的不同结论，本文旨在验证哪种评估方法更具诊断透明度。

Method: 生成了完整的8种排列组合的寄生空位刺激范式，使用Wilcox风格的wh-effect分析方法系统评估GPT-2模型在寄生空位环境中的表现。

Result: GPT-2在所有四个测试条件下都成功表现出对填充语-空位许可原则的稳健知识，即使在复杂的寄生空位环境中也是如此。

Conclusion: 直接最小对比较方法比差分法度量提供更清晰的诊断信息，评估指标的选择对准确评估LLM的句法能力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASA提出了一种多A共享适配架构，通过使用多个下投影矩阵A来丰富特征提取，解决LoRA中单一特征提取器的表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时提升下游任务适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA方法依赖单一的下投影矩阵A作为特征提取器，这形成了表示瓶颈，无法捕捉复杂任务所需的多样化信号，因此需要改进特征适配来提升下游任务适应能力。

Method: 提出MASA架构，采用多A单B结构，其中多个A专家集合在不同层间非对称共享以确保参数效率，这些专业化专家捕获多样化特征，然后由层特定的单个B矩阵进行整合。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA平均准确率达到59.62%，比标准LoRA提升1.08个百分点（相对改进1.84%），同时保持0.52%的可学习参数。

Conclusion: MASA通过多A专家集合的非对称共享架构，有效解决了LoRA的表示瓶颈问题，在参数效率约束下显著提升了模型在下游任务中的适应能力。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近使用LLM测试刺激贫乏论的研究在不同句法现象上得出矛盾结果，怀疑刺激物的词汇歧义和结构复杂性可能混淆模型表现。

Method: 1) 在先前使用的刺激物上建立基线；2) 使用SOTA生成式LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview）基于语言学模板生成精炼数据集以减轻混淆因素。

Result: 初步发现表明，GPT-2在精炼刺激物上的表现相比基线显著改善。

Conclusion: 刺激物质量显著影响基于惊讶度的LLM句法能力评估结果。

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文LLM面临独特挑战，现有基准主要是英文中心化，缺乏针对中文语言特性和结构化数据的评估。

Method: 构建中文数据-文本对(CDTP)数据集，包含结构化三元组和非结构化文本的对齐，支持知识图谱补全、三元组到文本生成和问答等多任务评估。

Result: 创建了包含700万文本对和1500万三元组的大规模数据集，通过实验验证了基准的有效性、监督微调能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CB-ECLLM基准填补了中文LLM评估的空白，支持可复现研究，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出ASPO方法，通过翻转正优势token的重要性采样比率来解决OSRL中的token级权重不平衡问题，改善了LLM强化学习的训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM后训练方法在强化学习中依赖token级裁剪机制，但OSRL范式存在根本缺陷：正优势token的重要性采样比率不匹配，导致正负token权重不平衡，抑制低概率token更新而过度放大高概率token。

Method: 提出ASPO方法：1）翻转正优势token的重要性采样比率，使其与负token的学习动态对齐；2）采用软双裁剪机制稳定极端更新同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在编程和数学推理基准测试中，ASPO显著缓解了早熟收敛问题，提高了训练稳定性，并在基于GRPO的强基线基础上提升了最终性能。

Conclusion: 分析为token级权重在OSRL中的作用提供了新见解，强调了在LLM强化学习中校正重要性采样的关键重要性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

TL;DR: 语言模型后训练虽然提升了指令跟随能力和下游任务表现，但在多有效答案任务中存在被忽视的成本。研究发现当前后训练技术会降低模型的上下文可控性、有效输出空间覆盖和分布对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示语言模型后训练在需要灵活上下文控制和分布匹配任务中的局限性，特别是当模型需要覆盖多种有效答案时。

Method: 提出Spectrum Suite评估框架，整合40+数据源和90+任务，用于评估模型在人类偏好、数值分布等多样化分布上的可控性。开发Spectrum Tuning后训练方法来提升这些能力。

Result: 发现当前后训练技术虽然能激发模型已有能力，但会损害上下文可控性。Spectrum Tuning方法在保持预训练模型优势的同时，显著提升了可控性、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐能力。

Conclusion: 语言模型后训练需要在激发能力与保持灵活性之间取得平衡，Spectrum Tuning提供了一种有效方法来改善模型在多样化分布任务上的表现。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

TL;DR: 本文研究了将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到小模型时的数据量缩放趋势，发现在竞争性编程任务中存在"代码推理低谷"现象：随着蒸馏数据量增加，性能先下降后以超对数线性方式上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探讨模型性能如何随蒸馏数据量的变化而缩放，特别是在代码推理能力的蒸馏方面。

Method: 在两个小型非推理LLM上蒸馏竞争性编程技能，研究数据量缩放趋势，并在不同蒸馏阶段进行微调以分析学习阶段。

Result: 发现了代码推理低谷现象；在低和中低数据量阶段，小模型从简单编程问题中获益更多；训练数据中输出的正确性对蒸馏结果没有影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对代码推理蒸馏训练动态的理解，超越了直觉判断。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside
intuition

Motivation: 研究大语言模型产生幻觉（生成看似合理但事实错误的陈述）的内在架构根源，理解这种失败模式的根本原因。

Method: 提出了Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)统一框架，整合可解释性技术来生成模型推理的因果图；识别了commitment layer（幻觉变得不可避免的层）；使用双过程理论解释关联路径与上下文路径的冲突。

Result: 发现上下文路径的连贯性与幻觉率呈强负相关（ρ = -0.863），表明这些失败是内部语义弱点的可预测结果；识别了特定的commitment layer。

Conclusion: 提供了Transformer架构中幻觉如何、何时以及为何发生的机制性解释，揭示了幻觉是可预测的内部语义弱点后果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

TL;DR: 提出并行分词器框架，通过双语词典对齐不同语言的词汇表，使语义等效词具有一致的索引，从而改善跨语言表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法在跨语言迁移中效果不佳，因为语义等效词被分配不同的嵌入表示，限制了跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 训练单语分词器，然后使用双语词典或词对词翻译来对齐词汇表，确保语义等效词具有一致的索引。

Result: 在13种低资源语言上预训练的模型，在情感分析、仇恨言论检测、情感分类和句子嵌入相似度等任务中，均优于传统多语言基线方法。

Conclusion: 重新思考分词方法对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源设置下。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: CreditDecoding是一种训练免费的并行解码算法，通过融合当前logits与历史轨迹信用来加速扩散大语言模型的文本生成，减少冗余迭代，实现4-5倍加速同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型在并行解码时，由于初始置信度低导致重复掩码令牌，造成冗余迭代，限制了整体加速效果。研究发现模型通常在解码步骤之前就已确定令牌的最终预测。

Method: 提出轨迹信用概念量化令牌的收敛潜力，通过累积历史logits。CreditDecoding算法融合当前logits与轨迹信用，加速正确但置信度不足的令牌的置信度收敛。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，相比LLaDA-8B-Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48性能提升，相比LLaDA-MoE-Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15性能提升。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效扩展到长序列，且与主流推理优化正交，是一个易于集成且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低资源语言场景下，由于缺乏人工标注数据，难以通过外在评估选择最佳LLM生成器的问题，同时内在指标与下游性能相关性差。

Method: 提出RoSE指标：用候选生成器的输出训练小模型，然后在其他候选生成器生成的合成示例上评估该小模型，最终RoSE分数是该小模型的平均性能。

Result: 在6个LLM、11种语言和3个任务上的实验表明，RoSE比任何其他内在启发式方法更频繁地识别出最优生成器，与最优生成器基线的差距仅为0.76个百分点。

Conclusion: RoSE是唯一与人类测试数据性能呈正相关的指标，为低资源语言场景下选择最佳LLM生成器提供了有效的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

### [163] [VecInfer: Efficient LLM Inference with Low-Bit KV Cache via Outlier-Suppressed Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06175)
*Dingyu Yao,Chenxu Yang,Zhengyang Tong,Zheng Lin,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer是一种新颖的向量量化方法，通过平滑变换和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存中的异常值，实现超低位宽下的KV缓存压缩，在2位量化时性能接近全精度，同时大幅提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在超低位宽下由于键缓存异常值导致性能严重下降，阻碍了代码本的有效利用，需要解决KV缓存的内存开销问题。

Method: 应用平滑变换和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存异常值，设计优化的CUDA内核融合计算与反量化操作以减少内存访问开销。

Result: 在2位量化下性能接近全精度，大规模自注意力计算加速2.7倍，单批次端到端延迟降低8.3倍（Llama-3.1-8B，196k序列长度）。

Conclusion: VecInfer通过抑制异常值和优化部署，在超低位宽下实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，显著提升了LLM推理性能。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

*Yoav Gur-Arieh,Mor Geva,Atticus Geiger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究发现语言模型使用位置、词汇和自反三种机制来绑定和检索实体，随着绑定实体数量增加，位置机制变得不可靠，模型会混合使用其他机制来补偿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文推理中绑定和检索实体的机制，特别是在复杂设置下位置机制的局限性。

Method: 在9个模型和10个绑定任务上进行广泛实验，开发结合三种机制的因果模型来估计下一个token分布。

Result: 发现模型混合使用三种机制的模式一致，开发的模型与真实分布达到95%的一致性，并能推广到更长的开放文本输入。

Conclusion: 研究建立了语言模型在上下文中绑定和检索实体的更完整图景，揭示了多种机制的混合使用模式。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

Motivation: 现有工作大多采用单次设置，忽视了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的现实工作流程，需要评估LLM在生成正确可执行代码方面的能力。

Method: 构建RECODE-H基准测试，包含结构化指令、单元测试和五级反馈层次；开发ReCodeAgent框架，将反馈集成到迭代代码生成中。

Result: 实验显示，使用更丰富的反馈可以显著提升性能，但复杂研究代码生成仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为开发适应性强、反馈驱动的LLM代理在科学研究实施中奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing
adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言，方言多样性高，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且仅关注标准孟加拉语，需要开发支持方言的实时语音助手。

Method: 采用客户端-服务器架构，使用RTP协议确保低延迟通信；通过微调IndicWav2Vec模型开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect，覆盖10种孟加拉语方言。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型提升12.41-33.98%；系统可在24kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟为4.9秒。

Conclusion: 低带宽使用和最小端到端延迟使系统既经济又交互性强，为孟加拉语多样化社区提供包容和可访问的语音技术。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

TL;DR: LST通过动态聚合语音标记为潜在语音片段，解决了自回归语音-文本模型中语音序列过长导致的训练和推理效率问题，在数据效率和计算效率方面都优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归语音-文本模型存在语音标记序列远长于文本标记的问题，导致模态间计算不平衡、训练推理效率低下，以及语音与文本对齐效果不佳，最终影响模型扩展能力。

Method: 提出潜在语音-文本变换器(LST)，通过动态且低成本地将语音标记聚合成潜在语音片段，这些片段作为更高级别的单元，可以对齐文本单元或封装常见语音序列以提高计算效率。

Result: LST在语音到语音和文本到文本基准测试中均优于传统方法，在HellaSwag故事补全任务中，语音准确率在计算控制训练下提升6.5%，在数据控制训练下提升5.3%，同时改进了文本性能。

Conclusion: LST通过更高效的语音标记聚合机制，显著提升了语音-文本模型的数据效率和计算效率，实现了更陡峭的扩展曲线和更好的模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

Motivation: 解决传统关系抽取中语言解释缺乏监督的问题，通过促进包含重要关系关键词的输出，提高模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用认知科学启发的文本处理步骤作为推理机制，结合强化学习优化过程，设计了同时提升任务准确性和解释质量的新型奖励函数。

Result: 在One-shot NYT29数据集上，CogRE使用Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct达到24.65% F1，强化学习优化后性能提升23.46%。人类评估显示解释质量相对提升54%。

Conclusion: CogRE框架有效解决了单次关系抽取中的注意力不集中和有限学习能力问题，显著提升了关系抽取的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

$L^\infty(0,T;L^1(\Omega))$ and $L^q(0,T;W^{1,q}_0(\Omega))$
($q<\tfrac{d+2}{d+1}$), to the renormalized solution of the problem.

Abstract: We develop and analyze a highly efficient, second-order time-marching scheme
for infinite-dimensional nonlinear geophysical fluid models, designed to
accurately approximate invariant measures-that is, the stationary statistical
properties (or climate) of the underlying dynamical system. Beyond second-order
accuracy in time, the scheme is particularly well suited for long-time
simulations due to two key features: it requires solving only a fixed symmetric
positive-definite linear system with constant coefficients at each step; and it
guarantees long-time stability, producing uniformly bounded solutions in time
for any bounded external forcing, regardless of initial data. For prototypical
models such as the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation, the method preserves
dissipativity, ensuring that numerical solutions remain bounded in a function
space compactly embedded in the phase space as time tends to infinity.
Leveraging this property, we rigorously prove convergence of both global
attractors and invariant measures of the discrete system to those of the
continuous model in the vanishing time-step limit. A central innovation of the
method is a mean-reverting scalar auxiliary variable (mr-SAV) formulation,
which preserves the dissipative structure of externally forced systems within
an appropriate phase space. For the infinite-dimensional models considered, we
additionally employ fractional-order function spaces to establish compactness
of numerical solutions in topologies compatible with the phase space.

Abstract: We propose and analyze an adaptive finite element method for a phase-field
model of dynamic brittle fracture. The model couples a second-order hyperbolic
equation for elastodynamics with the Ambrosio-Tortorelli regularization of the
Francfort-Marigo variational fracture energy, which circumvents the need for
explicit crack tracking. Our numerical scheme combines a staggered
time-stepping algorithm with a variational inequality formulation to strictly
enforce the irreversibility of damage. The mesh adaptation is driven by a
residual-based a posteriori-type estimator, enabling efficient resolution of
the evolving fracture process zone. The main theoretical contribution is a
rigorous convergence analysis, where we prove that the sequence of discrete
solutions generated by the AFEM converges (up to a tolerance) to a critical
point of the governing energy functional. Numerical experiments for a
two-dimensional domain containing an edge-crack under dynamic anti-plane shear
loading demonstrate our method's capability of autonomously capturing complex
phenomena, including crack branching and tortuosity, with significant
computational savings over uniform refinement.

Motivation: 传统的滤波球谐函数方法需要手动调整滤波器强度参数，这通常需要真实解或高精度参考解等难以获取的信息。为了解决这个问题，作者希望开发一种自动优化滤波器强度的方法。

Method: 将滤波器强度建模为神经网络，输入包括局部状态变量和材料截面参数。通过PDE约束优化问题求解最优滤波器强度，使用PyTorch实现离散化后优化的训练方法。

Result: 在多个测试问题中，神经网络驱动的滤波器显著提高了Pn近似的精度。在1-D测试中，常数滤波器在某些情况下表现更好，但在2-D问题中神经网络滤波器通常表现更优。

Conclusion: 神经网络驱动的滤波器强度优化方法能够有效提高辐射输运方程求解的精度，特别是在多维问题中表现突出，为传统数值方法提供了数据驱动的优化途径。

Abstract: We investigate a data-driven approach for tuning the filtered spherical
harmonics method (\fpn) when solving the radiation transport equation (RTE).
The \fpn method extends the classical spherical harmonics approach (\pn) by
introducing regularization through a filter operator, which mitigates spurious
oscillations caused by Gibbs' phenomenon. This filter includes a tunable
parameter, the {filter strength}, that controls the degree of smoothing applied
to the solution. However, selecting an optimal filter strength is nontrivial,
often requiring inaccessible information such as the true or a high-order
reference solution. To overcome this limitation, we model the filter strength
as a neural network whose inputs include local state variables and material
cross-sections. The optimal filter strength is formulated as the solution to a
PDE-constrained optimization problem, and the neural network is trained using a
discretize-then-optimize formulation in PyTorch. We evaluate the learned filter
strength across a suite of test problems and compare the results to those from
a simple, but tunable constant filter strength. In all cases, the
neural-network-driven filter substantially improves the accuracy of the \pn
approximation. For 1-D test cases, the constant filter outperforms the
neural-network filter in some cases, but in 2-D problems, the neural-network
filter generally performs better.

characterized by an algebraically nonlinear constitutive relationship between
stress and strain, which intrinsically enforces a limit on the norm of the
strain tensor. This approach allows the development of very large stresses, as
expected near a crack tip, while ensuring that the corresponding strains remain
physically bounded. A loosely coupled system of linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations governing the response of a thermo-mechanical
transversely isotropic solid is formulated. We develop a robust numerical
solution based on the finite element method, utilizing a conforming finite
element discretization within a continuous Galerkin framework to solve the
two-dimensional boundary value problem. The model is applied to analyze the
stress and strain fields near an edge crack under severe thermo-mechanical
loading. Our numerical results reveal a significant departure from classical
predictions: while stress concentrates intensely at the crack tip, the strain
grows at a substantially slower rate and remains bounded throughout the domain.
This work validates the efficacy of the strain-limiting model in regularizing
thermo-elastic crack-tip fields and establishes a reliable computational
foundation for the predictive modeling of thermally driven crack initiation and
evolution in advanced anisotropic materials.

Motivation: Helmholtz方程的数据完备问题是一个不适定的逆问题，难以获得稳定可靠的解。需要开发能够处理这种问题固有不稳定性和敏感性的方法。

Method: 结合粒子群优化（PSO）和Tikhonov正则化的生物启发方法，利用可访问区域的测量数据来识别不可访问边界上的未知边界条件。

Result: 数值实验结果表明，该方法能够产生准确且稳定的解，并具有可靠的收敛性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决这类逆问题的固有不稳定性和敏感性提供了一种有前景的途径。

Abstract: This paper tackles the data completion problem related to the Helmholtz
equation. The goal is to identify unknown boundary conditions on parts of the
boundary that cannot be accessed directly, by making use of measurements
collected from accessible regions. Such inverse problems are known to be
ill-posed in the Hadamard sense, which makes finding stable and dependable
solutions particularly difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a
bio-inspired method that combines Particle Swarm Optimization with Tikhonov
regularization. The results of our numerical experiments suggest that this
approach can yield solutions that are both accurate and stable, converging
reliably. Overall, this method provides a promising way to handle the inherent
instability and sensitivity of these types of inverse problems.

Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Volterra integral equations that generalize the
classical capillary rise models, allowing for nonsmooth kernels and
nonlinearities. To accommodate such generalities, we work in two families of
function spaces: spaces with prescribed modulus of continuity and integral
H\"older spaces. We establish existence results for solutions within the
integral H\"older space framework. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of
linear interpolation in these spaces and provide, for the first time, sharp
error estimates, demonstrating their optimality. Building on this foundation,
we propose a piecewise linear collocation method tailored to solutions in
integral H\"older spaces and prove its convergence. For problems admitting
smoother solutions, we develop an efficient spectral collocation scheme based
on Legendre nodes. Finally, several numerical experiments illustrate the
theoretical results and highlight the performance of the proposed methods.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的温基迭代投影方法(WB-IPM)，将学习方法和迭代方案有效结合，显著提高了荧光分子断层扫描(FMT)的深度重建精度，同时大幅减少了训练工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMT在深度重建中面临精度挑战，传统迭代方法z分辨率差，而监督学习方法需要大量高质量配对训练数据，这在实践中往往难以获取。需要探索如何将学习方法与迭代方案有效结合以获得更准确稳定的算法。

Method: 提出温基迭代投影方法(WB-IPM)，建立其理论基础。该方法仅依赖于真实值与神经网络输出之间差异的方向分量，使用较弱的损失函数。

Result: 该方法能够实现比基于学习和基于迭代的方法更准确的重建。通过误差分析以及模拟和真实数据实验验证了这些特性。

Conclusion: WB-IPM方法在FMT深度重建中表现出显著优势，既提高了重建精度，又大幅减少了训练工作量，为光学成像技术提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a widely used non-invasive optical
imaging technology in biomedical research. It usually faces significant
accuracy challenges in depth reconstruction, and conventional iterative methods
struggle with poor $z$-resolution even with advanced regularization. Supervised
learning approaches can improve recovery accuracy but rely on large,
high-quality paired training dataset that is often impractical to acquire in
practice. This naturally raises the question of how learning-based approaches
can be effectively combined with iterative schemes to yield more accurate and
stable algorithms. In this work, we present a novel warm-basis iterative
projection method (WB-IPM) and establish its theoretical underpinnings. The
method is able to achieve significantly more accurate reconstructions than the
learning-based and iterative-based methods. In addition, it allows a weaker
loss function depending solely on the directional component of the difference
between ground truth and neural network output, thereby substantially reducing
the training effort. These features are justified by our error analysis as well
as simulated and real-data experiments.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a widely used, non-invasive diagnostic tool in modern

medium. For large scale sound speed variations, this assumption leads to
blurred and distorted images. In this paper, we present a Geometrical Acoustics

given a known layered medium setting with continuously differentiable medium
boundaries. Existence and uniqueness conditions for a solution to the
underlying system of equations are given. Using numerical simulations, the
precision of our method is evaluated. Finally, the resulting image quality
improvements are demonstrated in a phantom-based experimental setup.

Abstract: Stochastic balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) algorithms
are developed and analyzed for the sampling of the solutions of linear
stochastic elliptic equations with random coefficients. Different from the
deterministic BDDC algorithms, the stochastic BDDC algorithms have online and
offline stages. At the offline stage, the Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions of
different components of the BDDC algorithms are constructed based on the
subdomain local parametrization of the stochastic coefficients. During the
online stage, the sample-dependent BDDC algorithm can be implemented with a
small cost. Under some assumptions, the condition number of the stochastic BDDC
preconditioned operator is estimated. Numerical experiments confirm the theory
and show that the stochastic BDDC algorithm outperforms the BDDC preconditioner
constructed using the mean value of the stochastic coefficients.

### [184] [Rule Encoding and Compliance in Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05106)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过信息论分析系统提示中规则编码对注意力机制和合规行为的影响，揭示了锚点冗余与注意力熵之间的权衡，并提出动态规则验证架构来提高LLM代理的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的安全关键代理设计需要超越简单的提示工程，需要系统分析规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为，以抵御提示注入攻击。

Method: 采用信息论分析多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），建立指针保真度界限，并结合动态规则验证架构进行形式化证明。

Result: 发现低语法熵和高集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡。动态规则验证架构能渐进提高合规输出的概率。

Conclusion: 需要原则性的锚点设计和双重执行机制来保护基于LLM的代理免受提示注入攻击，同时在演化领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

*Myung Ho Kim*

TL;DR: 提出了结构化认知循环（SCL）架构，将推理、记忆和控制功能分离，相比现有提示框架在多步任务中表现更可靠和可追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架将推理、记忆和控制功能混合在单一提示中，导致连贯性和可预测性降低，需要更清晰的架构来支持自主代理的多步任务执行。

Method: SCL架构将语言模型专用于推理，外部维护记忆，通过轻量级控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行，允许中间结果存储、重访和检查。

Result: 在360个测试场景中，SCL任务成功率平均86.3%，优于基线（70-77%），目标保真度更高，冗余调用更少，中间状态重用更可靠，每100次工具调用中不支持断言减少。

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追踪性，为扩展研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

TL;DR: SAC-Opt是一个基于语义锚点的后向引导修正框架，用于提升LLM生成优化模型代码的语义准确性，通过对比原始语义与生成代码重构语义的差异进行选择性修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型的方法主要依赖求解器反馈进行单次前向生成和有限的后处理，存在未被发现的语义错误，导致生成代码虽然语法正确但逻辑有缺陷。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，基于语义锚点进行后向引导修正，在每个步骤中将原始语义锚点与生成代码重构的语义锚点对齐，仅修正不匹配的组件，实现细粒度的约束和目标逻辑优化。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上的实验表明，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上提升高达21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正对于基于LLM的优化工作流程至关重要，能确保从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

TL;DR: 提出了动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，通过定性分析、证据收集和裁决三阶段结构化推理，解决LLM在处理复杂规则系统时的推理发散问题，显著优于传统思维链方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，它们通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本数据而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理发散和关键规则依赖关系的忽视。

Method: 提出动态裁决模板（DAT），受专家人类推理过程启发，将推理机制结构化为三个方法阶段：定性分析、证据收集和裁决。定性分析阶段全面评估上下文环境；证据收集阶段基于预定义模板元素有针对性地提取相关信息并进行系统验证；裁决阶段综合已验证组件形成全面判断。

Result: 实证结果表明DAT在复杂基于规则的任务中持续优于传统CoT方法。值得注意的是，DAT使较小的语言模型能够匹配甚至在某些情况下超过显著更大的LLM的性能。

Conclusion: DAT框架在管理复杂规则系统方面具有高效性和有效性，通过结构化推理过程解决了LLM在规则处理中的关键限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个确定性的统一框架，揭示意义接地本质上受信息论限制，统一哥德尔自指和统计无免费午餐两种视角。

Method: 将符号系统建模为通用图灵机，将接地定义为信息压缩过程，通过四个阶段论证：证明纯符号系统无法接地几乎所有可能世界；展示静态接地系统的固有不完备性；证明接地行为的不可推断性；使用柴廷不完备定理证明算法学习过程的局限性。

Result: 证明了符号接地存在根本性限制：纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；静态接地系统总存在对抗性不可压缩世界；接地行为需要新信息输入而不可推断；学习系统无法理解超过自身复杂度的世界。

Conclusion: 意义是系统不断尝试克服自身信息论限制的开放过程，符号接地存在根本性信息论约束。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，显著降低误差并提高成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，需要科学家手动解释问题为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数、实现稳定训练流程。现有LLM方法仅解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端视角。

Method: 设计包含四个互补智能体的多智能体系统：PDE智能体解析任务描述为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行并诊断错误进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验显示Lang-PINN相比基线方法显著降低误差（MSE减少3-5个数量级），端到端执行成功率提高50%以上，时间开销减少74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行且可验证的PINN代码，提供了构建PINN的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

### [192] [Plug-and-Play Dramaturge: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Iterative Narrative Script Refinement via Collaborative LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05188)
*Wenda Xie,Chao Guo,Yanqing Jing. Junle Wang,Yisheng Lv,Fei-Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dramaturge是一个基于分层多LLM代理的任务和特征导向的分治方法，用于改进长篇叙事脚本的质量。它通过全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段，以自上而下的方式确保上下文一致性，并通过粗到细的迭代过程持续优化脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM已广泛用于创意内容生成，但单次生成过程往往难以产生高质量的长篇叙事。如何像编剧一样有效修订和改进长篇叙事脚本仍然是一个重大挑战，因为这需要全面理解整个上下文以识别全局结构问题和局部细节缺陷，并在多个粒度和位置协调修订。

Method: Dramaturge包含三个主要阶段：1）全局审查阶段，掌握整体故事情节和结构问题；2）场景级审查阶段，识别详细的场景和句子缺陷；3）分层协调修订阶段，协调并整合整个脚本的结构和细节改进。采用自上而下的任务流程和从粗到细的迭代过程。

Result: 综合实验表明，Dramaturge在脚本级整体质量和场景级细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。该方法具有即插即用特性，可以轻松集成到现有方法中以改进生成的脚本。

Conclusion: Dramaturge通过分层多LLM代理的分治方法，有效解决了长篇叙事脚本修订中的挑战，确保了上下文一致性，并显著提升了脚本质量。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图推理的框架，将大语言模型与结构化人口属性和非结构化公众反馈相结合，用于公共卫生应急中的人口健康监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公共卫生应急期间大规模半结构化数据分析的挑战，传统方法效率低或需要大量标注数据，难以跨领域泛化。

Method: 使用弱监督管道，将大语言模型与人口属性、公众反馈集成，构建需求感知图，基于年龄、性别等多重剥夺指数进行人口特异性分析。

Result: 在真实数据集上的初步实验证明了该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境提供了可扩展的智能人口健康监测解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

Motivation: 现有方法在数据有限情况下预测模型在大规模采样时的能力和风险存在统计缺陷，这直接影响模型提供商和监管机构的风险评估。

Method: 引入基于beta-二项分布的稳健估计框架，并提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给更难的问题。

Result: 新方法能够以更低的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力表现。

Conclusion: 提出的创新方法解决了标准统计方法在数据有限场景下的预测准确性问题，为AI能力和风险评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架，结合模型奖励和规则奖励，通过多维度奖励信号提升多模态大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一信号、模型奖励的方法存在置信度校准不足、无法捕捉人类偏好多样性、需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练的问题。

Method: 集成互补奖励范式：模型奖励（学习奖励模型预测标量或向量分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供显式正确性信号），并引入多维度奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B参数模型中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 混合奖励建模框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐MLLMs提供了灵活有效的方法，在多个多模态基准测试中表现一致提升。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BIRD-INTERACT是一个多轮交互式文本到SQL基准测试，通过结合数据库、知识库和用户模拟器，支持完整的CRUD操作和动态交互，评估模型在真实数据库助手场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试将对话历史视为静态上下文或仅限于只读操作，无法反映生产级数据库助手的真实挑战，需要更全面的交互环境来评估模型处理模糊查询、执行错误和用户需求变化的能力。

Method: 构建了包含分层知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动用户模拟器的综合交互环境；设计了两种评估设置：预定义对话协议(c-Interact)和开放式智能体设置(a-Interact)；开发了涵盖完整CRUD操作的任务套件，包含模糊和后续子任务。

Result: BIRD-INTERACT具有很高难度：GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%的任务。通过记忆嫁接和交互测试时扩展验证了有效交互对复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT基准测试成功恢复了多轮文本到SQL任务的真实性，强调了有效交互在复杂动态数据库助手场景中的关键作用，为未来研究提供了全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Conclusion: M-Reason展示了在生物医学领域构建透明、可审计的多代理LLM系统的潜力，平衡了代理专业化、系统复杂性和资源使用之间的关键权衡。

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM

Motivation: 评估贝叶斯方法在MPC中的实际应用效果，系统分析现有研究如何实施贝叶斯技术来处理不确定性。

Method: 对贝叶斯MPC相关研究进行系统性分析，评估神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化的实现方式。

Result: 发现贝叶斯方法在MPC中应用日益增多，但在性能和鲁棒性方面的收益报告较为零散，基准不一致且可靠性分析有限。

Conclusion: 建议建立标准化基准、进行消融研究和透明报告，以严格评估贝叶斯技术在MPC中的有效性。

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用领域特定示例作为上下文演示存在效率低、计算成本高的问题，需要探索更高效的示例表示方式。

Method: 提出MHA-RAG框架，将示例表示为软提示，使用多头注意力机制作为超参数来控制不同任务的软提示生成，架构对示例顺序不敏感。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试和不同模型规模下，MHA-RAG相比标准RAG实现20分性能提升，推理成本降低10倍GFLOPs。

Conclusion: 软提示表示比纯文本表示更高效有效，MHA-RAG在保持高精度的同时显著提升效率，且对示例顺序具有不变性。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Motivation: 有意义的人机协作需要超越语言处理，深入理解符号及其社会建构意义。人类通过社会互动自然解释符号，而AI系统往往错过对话中出现的动态解释。

Method: 基于符号互动理论，进行了两个实证研究，调查人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义。

Result: 参与者会根据对话AI建议的符号和解释调整初始意义定义，特别是在引入社会背景时。参与者将个人和社会价值观投射到互动中，随时间推移精炼意义。

Conclusion: 共享理解不是源于简单一致，而是源于符号的双向交换和重新解释，这为人机交互设计提出了新范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

TL;DR: 提出基于师生学习框架的逆过程建模方法，用于解决钢铁热处理硬度预测的逆问题——从目标硬度值推断输入参数配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢铁热处理过程中，不同输入参数组合可能产生相同的硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数的逆问题特别困难。

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练前向模型（教师）从13个冶金输入特征预测最终硬度，然后训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈进行迭代监督优化。

Result: 在公开的调质钢数据集上评估，与基线回归和强化学习模型相比，师生框架不仅获得更高的逆预测精度，而且计算时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在材料科学逆过程建模中展现出高效性和有效性，为复杂工业过程的逆向设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型是否具备真正的推理能力，而非仅依赖记忆，测试其作为自主科学问题解决者的潜力。

Method: 从ICLR 2025提交中提取问题陈述，让专门的求解器代理通过迭代批判循环提出和改进技术解决方案，模拟科学探究过程。

Conclusion: 这是首次大规模证据表明LLMs可以作为自主科学问题解决者，既显示了其潜在能力，也揭示了当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现优异，但经常违反专家认为重要的领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中尤为令人担忧。

Method: 使用加权ASP规则形式化领域知识，通过Clingo求解器验证。以两种互补方式整合规则：(i)作为基于规则的数据增强，生成逻辑一致的合成样本；(ii)作为模糊逻辑正则化器，在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强BCE基线相比，该方法提高了微观和宏观F1分数，并在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违规减少。

Conclusion: 这是首个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动增强和可微分Transformer训练统一起来的大规模神经符号应用，用于可信赖的安全关键NLP。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类合作增多，需要了解认知边界和偏见如何影响共享代理能力，特别是AI是否也会像人类一样表现出过度自信的认知偏见。

Method: 通过分析多种编程语言中模型的置信度和性能表现，研究模型在不同能力水平和语言熟悉度下的自信偏差模式。

Result: 实验表明能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中操作的模型表现出更强的DKE-like偏见，偏见强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型确实会表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，这种认知偏见在模型能力较弱或面对不熟悉领域时更为明显。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

*Xin-Cheng Wen,Zirui Lin,Yijun Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Deheng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的自动漏洞修复方法，通过构建漏洞相关推理数据和使用强化学习来改进大语言模型在漏洞修复中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的自动漏洞修复方法面临两个主要挑战：缺乏高质量的漏洞相关推理数据，以及难以验证漏洞修复过程中的中间步骤。

Method: 该方法通过构建专门的漏洞相关推理数据集，并利用强化学习技术来训练大语言模型，使其能够更好地理解和修复软件漏洞。

Result: 虽然论文没有提供具体实验结果，但指出了现有方法的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 需要开发新的方法来生成漏洞相关推理数据，并设计能够验证中间修复过程的训练机制，以提升自动漏洞修复的效果。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),

enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed
ensemble model achieved an SMAPE of 1.407 with no signs of overfitting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、骨干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练来提升视觉-语言-动作模型在具身推理中的泛化能力，显著减少训练资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要任务特定的微调，在未见任务上泛化能力差，无法成为真正的通用智能体。

Method: 提出上下文感知元协同训练，将多样目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，利用结构多样的辅助任务提升域内泛化；引入轻量级元学习机制（源自注意力神经过程）实现快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，MetaVLA在长时程任务上比OpenVLA提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: 证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为实现通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）协调工作，在实时环境中优化多轮交互，在多种任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，对新场景泛化能力弱；智能体系统虽然通过模块化分解工作，但大多缺乏训练或离线训练，无法适应多轮交互的实时动态。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演化记忆，通过Flow-GRPO算法在多轮环境中进行在线策略训练，将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新，使用组归一化优势稳定学习。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，基于7B规模骨干的AgentFlow在搜索任务上平均准确率提升14.9%，智能体任务14.0%，数学任务14.5%，科学任务4.1%，甚至超过GPT-4o等更大专有模型。

Conclusion: AgentFlow通过在线优化显著改善了规划能力、工具调用可靠性和模型规模与推理轮数的正向扩展性，证明了在实时多轮环境中训练智能体系统的有效性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签（含不确定性）的能力，并测试这些标签如何影响肌肉骨骼X光片的多标签图像分类。

Method: 回顾性研究包括锁骨、肘部和拇指的X光片系列。GPT-4o在匿名化后填写结构化模板，将影像学发现标记为存在（"true"）、不存在（"false"）或"不确定"。为评估标签不确定性的影响，训练和验证集中的"不确定"标签被自动重新分配为"true"（包容性）或"false"（排他性）。使用ResNet50进行多标签分类。

Result: 自动提取在测试集中准确率达到98.6%。基于标签的模型训练在不同解剖区域均表现出竞争力，包容性和排他性模型的宏观平均AUC值相当（如肘部：AUC=0.80）。模型在外部数据集上泛化良好，不同标签策略或数据集之间无显著差异（p>=0.15）。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够从放射学报告中提取标签来训练具有竞争力的多标签分类模型，且检测到的放射学报告中的不确定性不影响这些模型的性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

Motivation: 解决具身AI因物理轨迹收集成本高昂而受限的问题，利用桌面游戏提供的大规模传感器运动交互作为替代预训练数据源。

Method: 开发OWA工具包统一桌面交互数据格式，构建Generalist-IDM实现跨游戏零样本泛化，使用VAPT将桌面预训练表示迁移到物理任务。

Conclusion: 桌面交互中的传感器运动基元具有足够的恒定性，能够有效迁移到物理具身任务，确立了桌面预训练作为机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Conclusion: AIC-VDS为紧急情况下的无人机数据收集提供了一种有效的替代方案，利用大语言模型的推理和泛化能力，避免了复杂训练过程。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault

Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动多智能体系统设计范式ARM，通过优化思维链推理来构建可泛化的智能体推理模块，显著优于手动设计和现有自动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的数据标注。思维链推理与复杂系统性能相当，表明需要更深入研究推理单元。

Method: 引入智能体推理模块(ARM)，将思维链推广为专门推理模块执行的细粒度推理步骤。通过代码空间的树搜索从简单思维链模块演化，利用执行轨迹反思指导突变。

Result: ARM方法显著优于手动设计的多智能体系统和最先进的自动设计方法，在不同基础模型和任务领域展现出优异的泛化性能，无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM作为通用的推理构建块，可以作为直接递归循环或元编排器的子程序使用，为多智能体系统设计提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星排放监测的鲁棒性，并为探索系统性误差提供计算高效途径。

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of

*Sedat Dogan,Nina Dethlefs,Debarati Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度得分的稳健方法来预测网络迷因的早期病毒性传播，使用跨语言Reddit数据集，在30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒性传播具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。研究旨在探索在无法获得完整传播级联数据的情况下，早期预测迷因病毒性的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度得分的病毒性定义方法，采用时间序列保留训练集来防止数据泄露。评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和MLP等模型，使用包含静态内容和网络特征的综合多模态特征集。

Result: XGBoost模型表现最佳，在仅30分钟内就达到PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了明显的"证据转换"现象：随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转移到时间动态。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在无法获得完整传播级联数据的情况下，建立了一个稳健、可解释且实用的早期病毒性预测基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RareAgent是一个自演化的多智能体系统，通过对抗性辩论和证据图构建来解决罕见病药物重定位问题，在缺乏先验关联的情况下显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病药物重定位在缺乏药物与目标疾病先验关联时面临挑战，传统知识图谱补全和消息传递GNN方法由于缺乏可靠信号而性能不佳。

Method: 采用自演化的多智能体系统，组织任务特定的对抗性辩论，让智能体从不同视角动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或推导假设，并通过事后分析推理策略进行自我进化。

Result: RareAgent将适应症AUPRC提升了18.1%，优于推理基线方法，并提供与临床证据一致的可解释推理链。

Conclusion: 该方法将罕见病药物重定位从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，通过多智能体辩论和自我进化机制有效解决了缺乏先验信号的问题。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

TL;DR: ConstraintLLM是首个专门为约束规划建模设计的大语言模型，通过多指令监督微调训练，在工业级基准测试中达到最先进的求解精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束规划在解决现实世界约束优化问题中具有重要作用，但相比运筹学模型，基于大语言模型的自动建模研究较少。

Method: 提出Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module增强上下文学习能力，整合到带有引导自校正机制的Tree-of-Thoughts框架中。

Conclusion: ConstraintLLM为构建可信赖的神经符号AI提供了有效工具，推动了约束规划领域的自动建模发展。

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具身人工智能的快速发展，需要更先进的集成模型来感知、解释和预测环境动态。World Models被引入以增强智能体预测未来环境状态和填补知识空白的能力，但必须确保预测对智能体和环境都是安全的。

Method: 进行了全面的文献综述，并辅以实证分析：收集和检查最先进模型的预测结果，识别和分类常见故障（称为病理），并对结果进行定量评估。

Result: 通过实证分析识别了World Models在场景和控制生成任务中的常见故障类型，并提供了这些故障的定量评估结果。

Conclusion: World Models在增强具身智能体能力方面具有重要作用，但其预测安全性需要特别关注，本文的研究为理解和管理这些模型的安全风险提供了系统框架。

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

TL;DR: 提出基于不确定性的过滤方法，使用模型自身置信度替代外部标签来筛选合成思维链数据，在生物扰动预测领域显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要真实标签来筛选合成思维链数据，这在生物等领域成本高昂。本文旨在开发无需标签的替代方案。

Method: 使用自一致性和预测困惑度等不确定性指标量化模型置信度，采样多个推理轨迹并仅保留低不确定性子集进行监督微调。

Result: 过滤后的数据准确性更高，基于不确定性过滤数据的监督微调优于未过滤合成数据，缩小了与真实标签训练的差距，并超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是创建高效推理数据集的强大信号，可在监督成本高的领域实现大型推理模型的应用。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

TL;DR: 提出DebateQD算法，通过辩论式进化优化LLM推理能力，发现说服优化比传统真值优化具有更好的泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于真值优化的LLM容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。辩论优化方法虽有潜力但缺乏系统比较

Method: 使用DebateQD质量多样性进化算法，在单LLM架构中通过提示策略演化多样化辩论策略，固定辩论协议只交换适应度函数（说服vs真值）

Result: 在三个模型规模（7B、32B、72B参数）和多个数据集上，说服优化策略的训练-测试泛化差距减小达13.94%，测试性能相当或更好

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力比协作性真值寻求能培养更具可迁移性的推理技能，为改进LLM泛化提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

TL;DR: FETA是一个无需训练的多智能体时间序列分类框架，通过基于示例的上下文推理实现高效准确的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，特定任务的训练成本高且不灵活，而纯零样本使用大型语言模型效果不佳。

Method: 将多变量时间序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注示例，利用推理LLM比较查询与示例并生成带置信度的通道级标签，最后通过置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策。

Result: 在九个UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的准确率，超越了多个经过训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转化为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过动态生成数学测试实例来评估模型的真实推理能力，避免测试集泄露和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学能力评估存在两个问题：模型会记忆公开测试集，以及现有数学基准因符号和规则多样性有限且答案封闭而容易过拟合。

Method: 使用MatheMagic动态生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的解释但保持答案可自动验证，在测试时随机生成实例来评估模型的归纳或演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎问题而非归纳问题，但会回归到标准数学；数学适应模型未能展现通用的推理"技能"，归纳任务的微调泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种稳定、可扩展、可比较且抗过拟合的数学推理评估方式，揭示了当前模型在真实推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Result: 实证表明，长期赋权最大化的策略具有数据高效性和有效性，能显著提升下游任务的适应性。

Conclusion: 赋权预训练是一种通用的初始化策略，为高维复杂任务的扩展研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较和评估不同模型的测试时扩展能力，而现有评估方法存在不足。

Method: 设计ARISE评估指标，包含两个关键创新：样本级感知机制（惩罚负扩展行为）和动态采样机制（减少准确率波动和token计数不稳定的影响）。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务上的实验表明，ARISE能可靠地测量测试时扩展能力，发现不同模型在扩展效率上存在显著差异，Claude Opus表现出最优的扩展特性。

Conclusion: ARISE提供了一个可靠且细粒度的测试时扩展能力评估框架，能够有效识别不同模型的扩展效率差异。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型展现出强大的多步推理能力，但存在令人担忧的安全漏洞，这些漏洞的机制尚未被充分理解。本研究旨在通过机制可解释性视角探究为什么安全对齐在推理模型中会失效。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪不同token位置的拒绝意图，发现"拒绝悬崖"现象。通过因果干预分析识别对拒绝行为产生负面影响的稀疏注意力头集。提出Cliff-as-a-Judge数据选择方法，选择展现最大拒绝悬崖的训练样本来高效修复推理模型的安全对齐。

Result: 发现许多对齐不良的推理模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持强烈拒绝意图，但在最终输出前拒绝分数急剧下降。仅消除3%的负面注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下。Cliff-as-a-Judge方法仅使用1.7%的普通安全训练数据即可实现可比的安全改进。

Conclusion: 推理模型并非本质上不安全，而是其拒绝意图被系统性地抑制。通过机制性洞察可以高效修复安全对齐问题，展示了安全对齐中的"少即是多"效应。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同程度的详细推理，但子问题的难度和复杂度差异很大，导致大量冗余。关键步骤需要详细推理，而简单步骤只需简洁处理。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链：对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推断。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，且没有影响准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning框架通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理冗余问题，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only

TL;DR: 提出了TelecomTS数据集，这是一个来自5G电信网络的大规模可观测性数据集，解决了现有数据集缺乏真实规模信息和多模态推理能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可观测性数据集在公共基准中代表性不足，通常经过匿名化和归一化处理，移除了规模信息，限制了在异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等任务中的应用。

Method: 从5G电信网络收集大规模可观测性数据，包含异构的去匿名化协变量和明确的规模信息，支持多种下游任务。

Result: 基准测试显示现有时间序列、语言和推理模型在处理可观测性数据的突发性、噪声和高方差动态方面表现不佳，强调了保留协变量绝对规模的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够原生利用规模信息的基础时间序列模型，以应对实际可观测性应用的需求。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

*Tao Zhe,Rui Liu,Fateme Memar,Xiao Luo,Wei Fan,Xinyue Ye,Zhongren Peng,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，将自然语言意图转化为约束感知的路线推荐，结合了语言灵活性和空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，无法适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法在空间推理和联合建模路线级与POI级偏好方面存在困难。

Method: 使用分层多智能体框架：先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后由管理器协调约束代理、POI代理和路径优化代理，最后通过验证代理确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功弥合了语言灵活性和空间结构之间的差距，实现了对路线可行性和用户偏好的有效推理。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

TL;DR: 本文比较了经典AI方法和基于大语言模型的方法在决策者对齐任务中的表现，发现在健康保险决策数据集上两者表现相当，经典AI方法在中等风险偏好上略有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着算法决策在高风险领域应用增多，AI对齐研究从通用价值对齐转向考虑决策者特定属性的情境化方法。现有决策者对齐方法在泛化到新情境方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 实现了一个经典AI模型并开发了基于LLM的算法决策器，使用GPT-5（推理模型）和GPT-4（非推理模型）在零样本提示框架下进行评估，采用加权自一致性方法。在健康保险决策数据集上评估三种不同风险容忍度（0.0、0.5、1.0）的决策者。

Result: 经典AI和基于LLM的模型在与基于属性的目标对齐方面表现相当，经典AI在中等风险偏好上表现出稍好的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 两种方法在决策者对齐任务中都有价值，经典AI方法在某些特定风险配置上可能具有优势，为AI对齐研究提供了实证比较。

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 优化大型语言模型在竞争环境中的表现会导致模型行为失准，即使明确要求保持真实，竞争压力仍会驱动欺骗性营销、虚假信息和有害行为的增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究竞争反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，揭示市场竞争压力可能导致AI系统失准的风险。

Method: 在广告营销、选举和社交媒体等竞争场景中构建模拟环境，测量优化竞争成功时的模型行为变化。

Result: 竞争优化导致：销售增长6.3%伴随欺骗性营销增加14.0%；得票率增长4.9%伴随虚假信息增加22.3%和民粹言论增加12.5%；参与度增长7.5%伴随虚假信息增加188.6%和有害行为推广增加16.3%。

Conclusion: 市场竞争压力会系统性地侵蚀AI对齐性，导致逐底竞争，需要更强治理和精心设计的激励机制来防止竞争动态破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时计算扩展（TTS）策略，包括顺序扩展和并行扩展，利用验证比生成更容易的不对称验证特性，在深度搜索智能体中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定场景（如解决数独谜题）中，验证响应比生成响应要容易得多，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时扩展的强大潜力。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（延长生成过程）和并行扩展（验证和选择多个候选输出）策略，利用不对称验证特性，为验证器分配适度的计算资源。

Result: 在BrowseComp基准测试上获得高达27个绝对点的提升，GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp上达到54.0%准确率，在GAIA上达到66.0%准确率；Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy在BrowseComp上达到69.0%准确率，大幅超越最佳专有模型结果。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展，特别是利用不对称验证特性，能够显著提升深度搜索智能体的性能，开源替代方案可以达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

Conclusion: TaTToo框架通过表格基础的过程奖励监督和工具验证，有效解决了表格推理中的关键挑战，显著提升了大型推理模型在表格领域的性能。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

*Farjana Yesmin,Nusrat Shirmin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，用于提升大数据环境下的可解释性和公平性，在空气质量数据集上表现出优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在环境监测等领域的复杂性增加，需要提高模型的可解释性和公平性以满足信任、伦理和法规要求，传统黑盒模型和后解释AI技术存在透明度不足或准确性妥协的问题。

Method: 使用类型2模糊聚类方法，结合粒计算和聚类技术，包含公平性度量和基于规则的组件，用于处理噪声数据的不确定性并生成语言规则。

Result: 相比类型1方法，聚类内聚性提升约4%（轮廓系数0.365 vs 0.349），公平性改善（熵值0.918），规则覆盖率达0.65，运行时线性增长（大数据采样约0.005秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法在可解释性、公平性和效率方面优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法，实现了4%的轮廓系数提升和高达1%的熵值减少。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行预测，并引入基于部分信息分解(PID)的指标来测量每个资产对模型决策的影响。

Result: 分析揭示两个关键发现：模型完全忽视数据波动性，且偏向低频价格变动数据。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融应用中存在对数据波动性忽视和频率偏见的风险，需要进一步关注和修正。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Conclusion: 该环境和零和框架适用于研究自主防御系统、攻击者-防御者共同进化以及向现实网络安全场景的迁移学习。

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理的优化(SBO)方法只能收敛到单一最优解，限制了设计空间探索并忽略了有价值的替代拓扑结构，需要转向能够生成多样化候选方案的生成式方法。

Method: 采用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)框架，学习设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，能够基于特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能设计组合。

Result: CVAE框架成功生成了256个新颖设计，有效率达94.1%。评估显示77.2%的有效设计性能优于SBO基准的单点最优解。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解，还提供了丰富的多样化候选组合，从根本上增强了工程设计过程，支持多标准决策制定。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够超越基于LIF神经元的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该QIF神经元离散化模型为深度SNN提供了一个有吸引力的LIF替代方案，结合了更丰富的动力学特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

*Haijin Xie,Gongquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种多头部注意力深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制来预测城市碳排放，并研究技术因素的影响。使用包含275个中国城市的面板数据集进行测试，结果显示MADCN模型在预测性能上优于传统机器学习和深度学习基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济进步和人工智能技术对促进可持续城市发展至关重要。需要开发有效的预测模型来研究这些技术因素对碳排放的影响，为政策制定提供科学依据。

Method: 提出多头部注意力深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，并采用SHAP可解释性学习来评估不同特征的贡献度。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上取得了优异的预测性能：均方误差406,151.063，平均绝对误差612.304，R平方值0.991。SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP是对碳排放影响最大的因素，而新质生产力、数字经济指数和AI技术水平也显示出有意义但相对温和的影响。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力、加强数字经济和加速AI技术发展可以显著有助于减少城市碳排放。政策制定者应优先将技术创新纳入碳减排战略，特别是通过推广智能基础设施和提升各部门数字化水平，以有效实现双碳目标。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出首个基于自监督预训练的电池容量估计模型，使用隐私友好的充电数据片段，通过片段相似性加权掩码输入重建学习丰富表示，在域偏移场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对消费者信心至关重要，但隐私法规和标注数据短缺限制了通用化模型的开发。现有自监督学习方法难以从隐私友好数据中有效学习，这类数据通常特征较少且噪声更大。

Method: 提出片段相似性加权掩码输入重建预训练框架，首先通过对比学习捕获片段间的高层相似性，然后进行相似性加权的掩码重建，学习细粒度充电模式和高层关联关系。

Result: 模型在制造商和老化引起的域偏移设置下，测试误差比最佳基准方法降低31.9%，在真实世界数据分布变化下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从特征较少、噪声更大的隐私友好数据中学习丰富表示，为电池容量估计提供了有效的自监督解决方案，在现实场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果注意力在GPU上的矩阵乘法操作存在优化空间，特别是当操作数或输出矩阵具有三角结构时，可以显著减少计算量。

Method: 基于机器学习和组合搜索发现的代数恒等式，构建FCA算法，专门优化具有三角结构的矩阵乘法操作，包括前向和后向传播中的因果注意力计算。

Result: 在GPU上，FCA相比默认PyTorch实现和Triton编译内核实现了显著加速，特别是在处理如Mask(QK^T)等因果注意力操作时。

Conclusion: FCA算法通过利用矩阵乘法的三角结构特性，有效减少了因果注意力的计算复杂度，为GPU上的注意力机制提供了高效的实现方案。

Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact
Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class
of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is
upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and
backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product
$\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches
noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatternKV是一种模式对齐残差量化方案，通过挖掘代表性模式向量、对齐KV向量并量化残差，改善低比特KV量化的保真度，在长上下文和测试时扩展场景中实现一致的2比特增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存已成为推理过程中的主要内存和带宽瓶颈，特别是在长上下文和测试时扩展场景中。现有KV量化方法由于原生KV分布缺乏平坦性，在低比特设置下准确率急剧下降。

Method: 提出PatternKV方案：在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量对齐到最近模式，仅量化残差部分，从而重塑KV分布、平坦化量化目标并缩小范围。

Result: 在多个骨干网络的长上下文和测试时扩展设置中，PatternKV实现一致的2比特增益，4比特相对FP16平均仅下降0.08%，测试时扩展准确率平均提升10%，吞吐量提高1.4倍，支持1.25倍更大批次。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过模式对齐残差量化有效解决了KV量化中的分布平坦性问题，显著提升了低比特设置下的性能和效率。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

TL;DR: 提出逻辑门控算子(LGO)，通过可学习位置和陡度的可微分门控，为符号回归提供单位感知阈值和条件逻辑，在医疗数据中恢复临床可解释的临界点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归虽然能生成可读方程，但难以编码单位感知阈值和条件逻辑，限制了在需要明确临界值的应用(如医疗诊断)中的实用性。

Method: 使用逻辑门控算子(LGO)作为类型化原语，包含可学习位置和陡度的可微分门控，并映射回物理单位进行审计。

Result: 在ICU和NHANES数据集上，硬门控变体恢复了临床合理的临界点：71%的评估阈值在指南锚点10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，且使用的门控数量远少于软变体。

Conclusion: 该方法生成紧凑的符号方程，具有明确的单位感知阈值，可将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供实用的机制切换和治理就绪部署能力。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合在真实IoT环境中部署，能够有效平衡检测性能和能源效率。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Motivation: 传统源分离方法依赖简化的源模型，无法准确复现数据。扩散模型能够直接从噪声、不完整数据中学习复杂先验分布。

Method: 利用扩散模型，仅基于多视角观测数据（不同观测包含未知源的不同线性变换）进行源分离，无需源显式假设。

Result: 方法在源未被单独观测、观测数据含噪声、不完整且分辨率变化的情况下仍能成功分离，并能从源先验采样、评估候选源概率、从联合后验分布采样。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成问题和真实星系观测中均表现出有效性，为源分离问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Method: 将核函数表示为可学习张量，在离散网格上均匀随机采样一次，通过插值步骤在不同分辨率网格间映射，使用蒙特卡罗方法近似积分算子。

Result: 在标准1D PDE基准测试中，MCNO实现了具有竞争力的精度和高效的计算成本。理论分析证明蒙特卡罗估计器在温和正则性假设下具有有界偏差和方差。

Conclusion: MCNO为连续域PDE的神经算子框架提供了一种理论支持的蒙特卡罗积分方法，可作为谱方法和基于图的蒙特卡罗方法的有效替代方案，并具有扩展到高维问题的潜力。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵在训练过程中的分布特性，测试矩阵模型在表示其分布方面的有效性，特别是在高斯性和置换对称性假设下。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型来建模权重矩阵分布，计算Wasserstein距离量化训练过程中分布的变化，测试不同初始化方案、正则化、层深度和层宽度的影响。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

Motivation: 现有研究假设参数完全已知或预先估计，而实际应用中参数需要从数据中学习。本文旨在开发一个更灵活的问题类别，将优化和学习整合到统一框架中。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1）直接替换参数的朴素APD扩展；2）考虑参数动态的动量调整学习感知APD变体。后者还采用了回溯策略实现自适应步长选择。

Result: 两种方法都实现了O(logK/K)的收敛速率，学习感知方法获得了更紧的O(1)常数，并在多最优解问题中达到O(1/√K)速率。在误设定投资组合优化问题上表现出优于现有算法的性能。

Conclusion: 本文成功开发了处理参数未知鞍点问题的统一框架，学习感知APD方法在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能，为误设定优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Method: 开发了广义SDP框架，支持异质激活函数和任意子网络选择，然后将其分解为线性复杂度的子问题序列，并开发了基于闭式解的快速变体。

Conclusion: 提出的算法提供了严格的Lipschitz常数上界，与网络鲁棒性紧密对齐，为神经网络鲁棒性验证提供了高效实用的工具。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

*Paloma García-de-Herreros,Philipp Slusallek,Dietrich Klakow,Vagrant Gautam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过消融研究比较了编码器专用模型和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应中的表现，发现解码器模型表现较差，提出了两种新方法（并行翻转和序列加倍）来提升解码器模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在自然语言处理中表现优异且扩展性好，但大多数跨模态适应方法专注于编码器专用模型，因此需要研究模型架构对跨模态适应的影响。

Method: 进行了一系列消融研究，系统比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的跨模态适应表现，并提出了并行翻转和序列加倍两种新方法。

Result: 发现直接应用现有方法时，解码器专用模型表现远不如编码器专用模型，扩展模型规模也无帮助。但提出的两种新方法显著提升了所有任务中解码器模型的性能，缩小了与编码器模型的差距。

Conclusion: 通过引入并行翻转和序列加倍方法，成功提升了解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中的性能，为科学机器学习拓宽了可用模型范围。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

TL;DR: 提出Action Gradient方法解决Decision Transformer在离线强化学习中的轨迹拼接和动作外推问题，通过直接调整动作来替代策略梯度方法，显著提升DT算法性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与Transformer结合，但面临轨迹拼接和动作外推两大挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题时不稳定，需要更有效的方法

Method: 提出Action Gradient方法，利用Q值对动作的梯度来优化动作，实现与策略梯度类似的功能，并能与token预测技术高效集成

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能显著提升DT基算法的性能，部分结果达到最先进水平

Conclusion: Action Gradient方法有效解决了DT的挑战，通过直接动作调整实现了稳定且显著的性能提升

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度神经网络的结构特性，特别是其与结构平衡理论的关系，以理解网络的内在秩序和功能行为。

Method: 通过计算签名图的挫折度，比较预训练深度卷积神经网络与零模型的差异，从统计物理和功能角度分析网络行为。

Result: 所有测试网络都显示出低于预期的挫折度，表明网络更接近结构平衡状态，表现出近单调性行为。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比随机模型更有序的行为，这揭示了一种新的隐含正则化形式。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型的两个安全关切：1）传统LLM硬件需求高，无法在消费级设备本地运行，依赖远程连接易受网络攻击；2）敏感任务微调涉及敏感数据，非私有微调算法使模型易受训练数据再现攻击。

Method: 引入可适应梯度裁剪和其他工程增强，改进标准DP-Adam优化器为DP-Adam-AC，并在两种本地化LLM设计（小型语言模型Qwen2.5-0.5B和1.58位量化Bitnet-b1.58-2B）上进行微调实验。

Result: 通过两个合成数据集的实验，展示了在损失函数方面的有前景的改进。

Conclusion: 通过增强差分隐私优化算法并将其应用于可本地化的语言模型微调，有效解决了LLM的安全和隐私问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用MSE作为正则化目标存在过度均匀优化问题，限制了对抗鲁棒性。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 提出两种正则化策略：(1)加权对抗互正则化，使用分解的对抗互KL散度损失，为主目标和辅助目标分配不等权重；(2)对抗泛化正则化，在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法相比现有正则化方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视互学习思想并设计专门的正则化策略，可以有效提升对抗训练的鲁棒性表现。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Motivation: 现代传感系统产生高维张量数据，需要既保持张量几何结构又能捕捉非线性相互作用的回归模型。现有张量回归器保持几何结构但本质线性，而神经网络在展平后提供非线性但丢弃空间结构且参数过多。

Method: 引入Tensor-on-Tensor回归神经网络（TRNN），将张量几何结构与神经网络非线性能力相结合，避免数据展平，保持空间结构。

Result: TRNN统一了保持张量结构的线性模型和具有非线性表达能力的神经网络两种范式。

Conclusion: TRNN为解决高维张量数据的回归问题提供了一种有效方法，既保持了数据的几何结构，又具备捕捉非线性相互作用的能力。

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

TL;DR: MADPO是一种改进的偏好优化方法，通过实例级别的自适应权重来解决DPO固定温度参数的问题，在情感生成任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖固定温度参数，导致在多样化偏好数据上训练效果不佳，容易对简单样本过拟合，对信息丰富样本学习不足。

Method: MADPO采用两步法：先训练奖励模型估计偏好边界，然后使用这些边界为每个训练样本的DPO损失应用连续自适应权重，对困难样本放大学习信号，对简单样本抑制学习信号。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在不同质量数据集上均显著优于基线方法，在高质量数据上性能提升达33.3%，在低质量数据上提升10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化景观且对奖励模型估计误差具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed

TL;DR: 提出MT-DAO优化器，通过多时间尺度动量解决分布式训练中不频繁通信策略的性能下降问题，消除与DDP的性能差距，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中频繁的梯度通信会饱和带宽，而不频繁通信策略（如Local SGD）在应用于自适应优化器时存在性能差距，这归因于优化器动量与长更新间隔的时间尺度不匹配。

Method: 提出MT-DAO优化器家族，采用多个慢速和快速移动的一阶动量来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，并提供首个收敛保证。

Result: 在语言模型预训练中，MT-DAO消除了与DDP的性能差距，在困惑度上优于不频繁通信基线，在以太网互连上减少6-27%的等token墙钟时间。在720M规模下，达到目标困惑度的步数减少24%，时间减少35%。

Conclusion: MT-DAO实现了有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围训练，解决了自适应优化器在不频繁通信场景下的性能问题。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

TL;DR: KVLinC是一个用于缓解KV缓存量化误差的框架，通过Hadamard旋转和线性校正适配器，在极低精度(如2位)下保持生成质量，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩和更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存量化是提高大语言模型推理效率的有效策略，但激进的低精度量化会引入显著误差，通过注意力机制传播并降低生成质量。

Method: 结合Hadamard旋转(减少值量化误差)和轻量级线性校正适配器(补偿量化键引入的误差)，并实现自定义注意力内核。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型系列上的广泛评估显示，KVLinC始终匹配或超越强基线，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention基线快达2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC框架有效解决了极低精度KV缓存量化带来的注意力误差问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Conclusion: 提出的随机特征神经网络方法在KL散度估计中具有理论保证的性能，解决了现有方法缺乏可证明性能的问题。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited

Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统造成严重辐射危害，准确预测其质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，采用基于LSTM的seq2seq模型，通过4折分层交叉验证评估不同配置：质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs一次性预测。

Result: 一次性预测比自回归预测误差更低；原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或逆转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；平均而言趋势平滑数据训练效果最好，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，一次性预测策略和适当的数据预处理方法能显著提升预测精度，模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

TL;DR: 提出了NoiseCurve方法，利用公开无标签数据估计的模型曲率来改进DP-SGD中的跨迭代噪声相关性，显著提升了差分隐私训练的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DP-SGD与普通SGD训练之间存在较大的准确性差距，需要改进隐私保护训练方法。DP-MF方法通过关联不同迭代中的隐私噪声来提升性能，但噪声关联质量有待改进

Method: 使用公开无标签数据估计模型曲率，基于此改进DP-MF中的跨迭代噪声相关性计算，提出NoiseCurve技术

Result: 在多个数据集、模型和隐私参数上的实验表明，NoiseCurve计算的噪声相关性相比DP-MF的相关方案在准确性上有持续且显著的提升

Conclusion: 利用模型曲率信息可以有效改进差分隐私训练中的噪声相关性，为提升隐私保护深度学习模型的性能提供了新思路

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

TL;DR: DVI是一种训练感知的自推测解码框架，通过将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在推理过程中进行持续在线学习，实现无损加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大型语言模型的主要延迟瓶颈，现有推测解码方法需要大量离线训练或额外组件，导致数据/计算成本高且在分布漂移下脆弱

Method: 将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在生成过程中将验证器的接受/拒绝决策转换为监督信号来更新起草器头，采用KL→RL调度策略进行在线蒸馏和策略梯度训练

Result: 在Spec-Bench上实现2.16倍实时加速，与EAGLE-2等最先进方法相当，但训练数据需求少几个数量级

Conclusion: 训练感知的自推测方法能够在最小训练开销下实现最先进的无损加速

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，让攻击者自动生成多样化的提示注入攻击，代理学习防御这些攻击，显著降低攻击成功率并提高任务完成率。

Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具使用存在间接提示注入安全风险，现有防御方法依赖手动构建的攻击数据集，缺乏多样性且无法应对新型攻击。

Method: 提出ARLAS框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈，通过对抗性强化学习共同训练攻击者和代理，采用基于种群的学习框架防止循环学习。

Conclusion: ARLAS框架能够自动生成多样化攻击并训练出更鲁棒的代理，相比基础模型具有更好的安全性和任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在有限时域MDP中的元强化学习，提出了两种基于Thompson采样的算法MTSRL和MTSRL⁺，通过线性表示和Gaussian元先验来学习任务间共享的最优动作价值函数结构，并提供了元后悔保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是利用相关任务在最优动作价值函数中的相似结构，通过元学习来提高强化学习效率，特别是在任务数量较多时超越独立任务学习的方法。

Method: 方法包括：1）假设最优Q函数具有线性表示；2）使用Gaussian元先验；3）提出MTSRL（仅学习先验均值）和MTSRL⁺（额外学习协方差并使用先验扩展）；4）开发先验对齐技术。

Result: 结果：对于已知协方差的情况获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√ANK)元后悔，对于学习协方差的情况获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√AN³K)元后悔。在任务数量足够多时（K ≳ Õ(H²)或K ≳ Õ(N²H²)）优于独立任务学习。

Conclusion: 结论：这是首个为具有学习Q先验的Thompson风格RL提供元后悔保证的工作，提供了实用的实验方法（通过RLSVI预热启动、OLS聚合、协方差扩展），在实验丰富的设置中表现优异。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架在径流预测精度和不确定性量化方面表现优异，可作为有效的洪水早期预警系统。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活和梯度来降低大语言模型分布式训练的通信开销，在相同比特预算下优于固定精度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长，给服务器-客户端分布式训练带来通信效率和计算开销的挑战，需要在低资源设备上实现高效的协作训练。

Method: 采用参数高效的分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于特征和层级重要性通过比特正则化在通道间分配比特预算，渐进地将激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)压缩到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同比特预算下，AMAQ比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B等模型上生成准确率提高约2.5%，分类准确率提高约1.3%，显著提升训练稳定性并减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，以适度的通信开销获得优越的推理准确率，是通信成本最小化的实用协作训练解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Motivation: 现有分子动力学模拟方法通常强制严格等变性、依赖顺序展开，限制了灵活性和效率；且多为单任务训练，无法泛化到未见化合物和扩展时间步。

Method: 采用准等变设计（无需显式分子图）和时间注意力机制，允许并行解码多个未来状态；在TG80数据集（包含80种化合物的250万飞秒轨迹）上进行多任务预训练。

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何条件，但产生的更新具有高度不均匀的神经元范数，导致某些神经元主导优化过程。需要系统性地结合正交化和自适应学习率的优势。

Method: 提出NorMuon优化器，维护每个神经元的二阶动量统计量，在正交化后应用行级归一化，确保平衡的参数利用同时保留Muon的条件改善优势。开发了基于FSDP2框架的高效分布式实现。

Result: 在多个模型规模上的实验表明，NorMuon始终优于Adam和Muon，在1.1B预训练设置中比Adam提高21.74%的训练效率，比Muon提高11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在周期性、对称性约束设置下的表达能力仍然缺乏理论理解，需要从计算复杂性角度分析其内在极限。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于脑电图(EEG)的疼痛监测系统，使用机器学习模型分类高疼痛与低/无疼痛状态，在健康成人中达到88.9%的准确率，为临床疼痛评估提供了技术可行的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估依赖患者自述或非特异性心电图生命体征，导致危重、镇静和认知障碍患者面临疼痛治疗不足或阿片类药物过度使用的风险。

Method: 使用52名健康成年人的EEG数据，暴露于三种强度激光诱发疼痛，将4秒EEG时段转换为537个特征向量，评估9种传统机器学习模型，采用留一交叉验证。

Result: 支持向量机(RBF核)获得最佳离线性能(88.9%准确率，1.02ms推理时间)，XGBoost实时模型保持约4ms延迟和94.2%准确率。特征重要性分析与疼痛生理学一致。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测器在临床环境中技术上可行，为临床验证提供了途径，有望改善危重患者的疼痛管理。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeST-BO是一种针对高维贝叶斯优化的局部方法，通过高斯过程联合学习梯度和海森矩阵信息，并基于牛顿步误差的一步前瞻界来选择评估点，实现了在保持步长目标的同时将计算成本从O(d²)降低到O(m²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在处理昂贵黑盒问题时很有效，但在高维空间中面临挑战，需要解决计算复杂度和收敛性的问题。

Method: 提出NeST-BO方法，使用高斯过程代理模型联合学习梯度和海森矩阵信息，通过一步前瞻界选择评估点，并在低维子空间中优化获取函数以降低计算成本。

Result: 在高维合成和真实世界问题中，NeST-BO相比最先进的局部和高维贝叶斯优化基线方法，始终表现出更快的收敛速度和更低的遗憾值。

Conclusion: NeST-BO通过结合牛顿步长目标、误差收缩性质和子空间优化，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法存在三个关键问题：偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和冗长性偏差，现有工作大多只解决其中一个问题，且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，在离线和在线设置下同时解决三个问题，无需估计多个奖励模型，实现简单。

Result: 理论分析显示DPO-COV在污染数据上获得与干净数据相当的长度正则化泛化误差率，实验证明在离线和在线设置下均有效。

Conclusion: 提出的COV算法能同时解决RLHF/DPO的三个关键问题，理论保证强，实现简单，且证明了RLHF与DPO的等价性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Motivation: 图函数模型需要大图进行准确估计，但实践中往往只能获得小规模网络。迁移学习可以通过利用相关大源图的结构信息来提高小目标图的估计精度

Method: GTRANS框架整合邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输来对齐图结构，并包含自适应去偏机制通过残差平滑识别和校正目标特定偏差

Conclusion: GTRANS显著提升了小目标图的图函数估计精度，并直接改善了图分类和链接预测等下游任务的性能

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新颖的一次性后训练剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解方法实现2:4稀疏化，在保持推理加速和内存使用减少的同时，显著优于现有2:4剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临巨大计算和内存需求挑战，现有2:4稀疏化方法通常会导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的剪枝技术。

Method: ARMOR将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵包装器，通过块坐标下降算法最小化层间代理损失来选择这些组件。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型系列上的实验表明，ARMOR在下游任务和困惑度评估中一致且显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间建立了更有效的权衡，同时保留了2:4剪枝的推理加速和内存使用减少优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LATTA方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚点机制，在测试时自适应中实现更稳定有效的模型适应，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或复杂损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失表面上的确定性更新。

Method: LATTA结合两种机制：1）受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；2）稳定权重锚点，防止模型偏离其鲁棒的源预训练。

Result: 在Rotated-MNIST和CIFAR-10-C等标准基准测试中，LATTA显著优于Tent、CoTTA和EATA等方法，在CIFAR-10-C上平均准确率提高超过2%，同时降低性能方差。

Conclusion: LATTA无需架构改变或昂贵的蒙特卡洛传递，在保持稳定性的同时实现了有效的测试时自适应，为自监督TTA设定了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互，且在分布式场景中面临数据不平衡、异构性和隐私限制等挑战，需要开发能够在不共享敏感数据的情况下整合各客户端特征选择知识的框架。

Method: 1) 开发隐私保护的知识融合策略，在不共享原始敏感数据的情况下获得统一表示空间；2) 引入样本感知权重策略，解决异构本地客户端之间的分布不平衡问题。

Result: 大量实验验证了该框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了分布式特征选择中的隐私保护和数据异构性问题，为联邦学习场景下的特征选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

TL;DR: 论文分析了注意力缩放对长上下文语言模型的重要性，发现当上下文长度增加时，注意力分数会趋于均匀化，导致token过度聚集。通过理论分析确定了临界缩放因子β_n ∝ log n，为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理更长上下文，注意力层出现病理现象：注意力分数随上下文长度增加而趋于均匀，导致token过度聚集（rank-collapse）。虽然注意力缩放通过多对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数来应对这一问题，但缺乏理论支持。

Method: 分析了一个简化但可处理的模型，该模型放大了注意力缩放的效果。在该模型中，注意力表现出由缩放因子β_n控制的相变：缩放不足会使所有token塌陷到单一方向，而过度缩放会将注意力简化为恒等变换，消除token间的有意义的交互。

Result: 主要结果确定了临界缩放β_n ∝ log n，并提供了对YaRN和Qwen中注意力缩放的严格理论依据，阐明了为什么对数缩放能在长上下文长度下保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力。

Conclusion: 研究为注意力缩放提供了理论支持，明确了临界缩放因子为对数尺度，这对于在长上下文语言模型中维持有效的注意力机制至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Conclusion: TGAE方法能够有效模拟时序图的结构和时序特性，在质量和效率方面都表现出色，为时序图生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统协作学习基于模型权重共享，而基于嵌入共享的方法在资源效率上有优势，但目前缺乏针对嵌入共享的差分隐私机制。

Method: 联合学习隐私编码网络和小型效用生成网络，使生成的嵌入具有正式差分隐私保证，然后将私有化嵌入共享给服务器进行后处理。

Result: 该方法只需一轮私有化通信，客户端计算量少于传统方法，且私有化嵌入与服务器模型类型无关。

Conclusion: 通过协作学习和隐私学习的协同设计，实现了资源高效且具有正式隐私保证的嵌入共享协作学习方案。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中会记忆训练数据，导致严重的隐私泄露风险，需要更有效的隐私风险评估方法。

Method: 基于信息论原理构建成员推理攻击框架InfoRMIA，并扩展到token级别的分析，能够定位具体记忆的token。

Result: InfoRMIA在基准测试中始终优于RMIA，计算效率更高，token级分析能够精确定位泄露位置。

Conclusion: 提出了更有效的隐私评估方法，并通过token级分析重新思考LLM中的隐私问题，为针对性缓解措施提供基础。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GNN架构复杂性不断增加，但全局注意力机制相对于传统消息传递层的实际优势尚不明确，需要系统性的基准测试来隔离不同组件的贡献。

Method: 构建基于HydraGNN的统一可复现基准框架，支持四种受控模型类：纯MPNN、带编码器的MPNN、MPNN与全局注意力混合的GPS风格模型、以及带编码器的完全融合局部-全局模型。

Result: 在7个多样化开源数据集上的测试表明，编码器增强的MPNN形成稳健基线，而融合局部-全局模型在长程相互作用效应主导的属性上带来最明显收益。同时量化了注意力的精度-计算权衡及其内存开销。

Conclusion: 建立了原子级图学习中全局注意力的首个受控评估，为未来模型开发提供了可复现的测试平台，明确了不同架构组件在不同任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

TL;DR: TimePD是首个用于时间序列预测的源自由领域自适应框架，通过代理去噪和LLM泛化能力，在无法访问源数据的情况下将预训练模型适应到稀疏目标时间序列领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备产生大量时间序列数据，需要有效的预测方法。本研究关注源自由领域自适应问题，旨在在不访问源数据的情况下将预训练模型适应到稀疏目标时间序列领域，符合数据保护法规要求。

Method: TimePD包含三个关键组件：1)基于季节趋势分解的双分支不变解耦特征学习；2)轻量级无参数代理去噪动态校准LLM系统偏差；3)双向对齐去噪预测和原始目标预测的知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimePD平均优于最先进基线方法9.3%。

Conclusion: TimePD是首个源自由时间序列预测框架，通过代理去噪有效解决了源数据不可访问情况下的领域自适应问题，在真实数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

*Andrew Ly,Pulin Gong*

TL;DR: 深度学习存在可预测性的基本限制，源于其吸引盆的复杂分形几何结构，即使大幅提高初始条件精度也只能略微改善结果可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习中的基本可预测性限制，理解神经网络训练结果不可重复性的根源。

Method: 通过分析深度学习中的混沌学习动态和对称性诱导的不变子空间，推导出出现复杂吸引盆的充分条件。

Result: 发现深度学习吸引盆具有无限精细的分形结构，不确定性指数接近零，导致训练结果难以预测。

Conclusion: 复杂吸引盆结构对深度学习可预测性和可重复性施加了基本限制，这对优化和AI安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

*Alexander Murphy,Michal Danilowski,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Abhirup Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEO是一种无需超参数、计算开销极小的测试时自适应方法，通过重新中心化目标数据嵌入来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在计算成本高、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感的问题，需要一种更高效、鲁棒的自适应方法。

Method: 基于潜空间几何理论，通过将目标数据嵌入重新中心化到原点来改善对齐，提出NEO方法——一种无需超参数、计算开销与普通推理相当的TTA方法。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上将ViT-Base准确率从55.6%提升至59.2%；在多个数据集上优于7种对比方法；在边缘设备上减少63%推理时间和9%内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO能高效有效地用于测试时自适应，在多种ViT架构和数据集上表现优异，特别适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS)指标和正则化方法，用于量化并控制概念侧信道模型在准确性和可解释性之间的权衡，通过惩罚侧信道依赖来提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过引入侧信道绕过概念瓶颈来提高准确性，但会损害可解释性。目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入SIS指标量化侧信道依赖，并提出SIS正则化来显式惩罚侧信道依赖。

Result: 实验表明，仅追求准确性的CSMs可解释性较低，而SIS正则化能显著提升可解释性、可干预性和可解释任务预测器的质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发平衡准确性和可解释性的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的归纳图梯度提升机(G-GBM)，用于异构动态图上的监督学习，在保险欺诈检测中表现出色，并能提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈检测中，图方法因类别不平衡和图的异构动态特性而难以获得有意义的表示，而基于表格数据的梯度提升树方法仍占主导地位。

Method: 开发了归纳图梯度提升机(G-GBM)，结合图神经网络和梯度提升树的优势，使用梯度提升森林作为骨干模型。

Result: 在模拟随机图实验中与流行的图神经网络方法竞争，在开源和专有真实数据集上展示了保险欺诈检测的强大能力。

Conclusion: G-GBM不仅能有效检测保险欺诈，还能通过既有的可解释性方法提供预测洞察。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Conclusion: 建立了一个原则性、不确定性感知且结构敏感的量子图神经网络解释方法，为扩展到更广泛架构和真实数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε, δ)精度保证，在保持高质量的同时实现高达20倍的稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法（如top-k和采样）存在根本性限制：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 基于top-k和随机采样的互补性观察，结合两者的优势，利用采样的统计保证，开发了具有用户指定精度保证的vAttention机制。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在20倍稀疏度下匹配全模型质量，在推理场景中实现快速解码而不损失质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是第一个具有实用精度保证的稀疏注意力机制，为大规模稀疏注意力的可靠部署迈出了重要一步，提供了优越的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的原对偶DPO方法来解决LLMs的约束对齐问题，在最大化输出奖励的同时限制不安全内容的成本低于阈值，显著降低了内存和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs安全对齐方法要么需要训练奖励和成本模型导致高内存计算成本，要么需要关于最优解的先验知识，因此需要一种更高效的约束对齐方法。

Method: 首先在奖励偏好数据上使用标准DPO训练模型提供奖励信息，然后采用重新排列的拉格朗日DPO目标利用奖励信息在成本偏好数据上微调LLMs。

Result: 在广泛使用的偏好数据集PKU-SafeRLHF上的实验结果表明该方法有效，并建立了关于输出策略次优性和约束违反的严格理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了内存和计算成本，无需额外先验知识，并扩展到在线数据设置，通过探索奖励来探索未覆盖的提示-响应空间。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督序列解缠结方法依赖变分自编码器和生成对抗网络，需要多个损失项，优化复杂，且在真实数据上表现不佳，缺乏标准评估协议。扩散模型作为先进生成模型，在序列解缠结中尚无理论形式化。

Method: DiffSDA结合概率建模、潜在扩散和高效采样器，构建模态无关的序列解缠结框架。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，DiffSDA在序列解缠结任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DiffSDA为序列解缠结提供了有效的扩散模型解决方案，在多种真实数据模态上表现出色。

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和多模式挖掘机制，有效解决了传统图嵌入方法在邻域定义和场景适应性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代掩码扩散模型中的启发式调度策略，通过将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，优化生成样本与数据分布的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在语言建模中性能高度依赖于选择下一个去掩码位置的策略，而现有方法主要依赖基于规则的启发式调度，缺乏理论保证。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，使用显式参考策略，优化具有策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习策略始终优于最大置信度方法，在SUDOKU任务上比随机策略提升20.1%，比最大置信度提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，在关键任务中显著优于启发式调度方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统中的合作诱导方法，探索直接通信和课程学习两种途径在协调问题中的有效性。

Method: 在猎鹿游戏中测试单词语通信效果，在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中评估课程学习方法，通过逐步复杂化的游戏序列进行训练。

Result: 通信显著提升合作率（0%→48.3%），而课程学习反而降低收益27.4%，且可能诱导智能体产生'习得性悲观'。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单的通信协议比基于经验的训练更可靠，课程设计需要仔细考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

TL;DR: 该论文通过因果效应估计框架系统评估了异构图神经网络(HGNNs)的有效性，发现模型架构对性能没有因果影响，而异构信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多假设HGNNs本身有效，但缺乏对其内在有效性的系统检验，需要从模型架构和异构信息两个角度深入分析HGNNs的真实效果。

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统复现和超参数调优，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并使用最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检查和敏感性分析验证鲁棒性。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果效应；异构信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分。

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要来自异构信息而非模型架构，这为未来研究提供了重要启示，应更关注信息质量而非模型复杂度。

classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at

*Yuxuan Bai,Gauri Pradhan,Marlon Tobaben,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了迁移学习场景下多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，发现攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低，且没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险。LiRA在多数情况下表现最佳，但在高数据量下IHA对PatchCamelyon数据集更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的出现，训练范式从零开始训练转向迁移学习，这使得使用敏感应用中的小规模领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。然而，先前对迁移学习微调模型的MIA评估仅依赖少量攻击方法。

Method: 在迁移学习设置下比较多种MIA的性能，包括基于分数的攻击和似然比攻击(LiRA)、逆海森攻击(IHA)等，帮助实践者识别最有效的隐私风险评估攻击方法。

Result: 攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低；没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险；LiRA在大多数实验场景中表现最优；在高数据量下，IHA对PatchCamelyon数据集更有效。

Conclusion: 迁移学习场景下的隐私风险评估需要多种MIA方法结合使用，LiRA是通用性较好的选择，但在特定数据集和高数据量情况下IHA可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据的隐私保护框架，通过限制每个SNP序列在训练中的影响来提供差分隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集对遗传研究至关重要，但共享时存在严重的隐私风险，现有方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂的后处理过程。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私保护。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在ε∈[1,10]、δ=10^-4的隐私预算下有效，合成数据集能密切复制非私有数据集的统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护隐私的同时实现了基因组数据的灵活共享，为研究人员提供了卓越的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用贝塞尔曲线替代完整SGD轨迹的数据集压缩方法，通过平滑的低损失参数化替代路径来稳定梯度、加速收敛并减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法使用完整SGD轨迹作为对齐目标，但这些轨迹噪声大、曲率高且存储密集，导致梯度不稳定、收敛慢和内存开销大。

Method: 用连接初始和最终模型状态的二次贝塞尔曲线作为平滑、低损失的参数化替代路径，替代完整的SGD轨迹。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上优于最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持有效的临床模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接路径作为SGD路径的有效替代，提供了无噪声、低曲率的监督信号，稳定了梯度、加速了收敛并消除了密集轨迹存储的需求。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

TL;DR: 提出Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF)方法，通过熵退火和前瞻调制解决粒子滤波在推理时缩放中的粒子贫化问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粒子滤波在复杂数学推理任务中表现良好，但容易受到过程奖励模型过度自信评分的影响，导致过早利用局部最优解，出现粒子贫化问题，特别是在计算资源受限时更为严重。

Method: 提出ePF算法，包含两个新技术：1) 熵退火(EA) - 通过监控搜索多样性，在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布；2) 前瞻调制(LaM) - 基于后继状态评估状态的潜力。

Result: 在多个挑战性数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

TL;DR: 提出MDTI框架，通过整合GPS序列、网格轨迹和道路网络约束的多模态轨迹表示学习方法，提升旅行时间估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示，忽略了真实轨迹的变异性，导致信息丢失或特征冗余。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕获空间、时间和拓扑语义，动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度，并采用对比对齐和掩码语言建模的自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MDTI始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MDTI框架具有鲁棒性和强泛化能力，能有效提升旅行时间估计精度。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 指导预训练的基于流的生成模型进行条件生成或产生具有目标属性的样本，无需在配对数据上重新训练即可解决多样化任务。

Method: 利用流模型中通常为高斯分布的源分布先验，通过椭圆切片采样在源空间直接进行贝叶斯推断，仅需前向传递，无需梯度或雅可比计算。

Result: 在材料设计和蛋白质结构预测任务中展示了有效性，能够根据稀疏残基间距离测量预测蛋白质结构。

Conclusion: ESS-Flow为条件生成提供了一种无需梯度的有效方法，特别适用于梯度不可靠或不可用的情况。

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Motivation: 在零售、金融、医疗和推荐系统等领域，事件发生的精确时间顺序往往不如结果集合重要，因此需要研究非自回归的预测方法。

Method: 分析了局部顺序不变性，引入了基于KL散度的指标来量化时间漂移，比较了显式分布预测与隐式多标记方法。

Result: 简单的显式分布预测目标始终优于复杂的隐式基线方法，预测类别模式崩溃主要由分布不平衡驱动。

Conclusion: 为选择建模策略提供了原则性框架，并为构建更准确和鲁棒的预测系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 提出Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO)方法，通过元学习和条件神经过程学习物理模拟中的共享潜在结构，能够快速适应新的物理参数而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格模拟精确但计算昂贵，数据驱动的图网络模拟器(GNS)虽然推理快，但需要为每个参数变化重新训练，且数据收集成本高。不同参数的模拟通常共享相同的潜在结构。

Method: 使用元学习学习共享结构，结合条件神经过程(CNPs)编码图轨迹生成潜在表示，并设计新的神经算子架构来减轻时间上的误差累积。

Result: 在多个具有变化材料属性的动力学预测任务中验证，MaNGO在未见材料属性上的准确度接近oracle模型，性能优于现有GNS方法。

Conclusion: MaNGO通过元学习有效解决了GNS方法在参数变化时需要重新训练的问题，实现了对新物理参数的快速适应。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Motivation: Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了其可扩展性。虽然线性注意力将复杂度降至线性，但从头预训练成本过高。现有的后训练线性化方法存在缺陷，线性组件被绕过，主要依赖滑动窗口softmax。

Method: 提出三种方法：(1) 推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；(2) HedgeCATs，结合注意力权重转移与目标LoRA微调；(3) 计划滑动窗口dropout(SSD)，在训练中随机抑制softmax分支以防止组件崩溃。

Conclusion: 通过提出的三种解决方案，成功解决了现有混合线性注意力方法中线性组件被绕过的问题，实现了平衡的组件使用和真正的线性注意力采用。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

Motivation: 深度生成模型面临样本质量与记忆化之间的基本权衡，高质量样本往往以记忆训练数据为代价，而非泛化到基础数据几何结构。

Method: 将流匹配中的均匀各向同性噪声替换为空间变化、各向异性的高斯噪声，其协方差捕捉潜在数据流形的局部几何结构。

Result: 在多种数据集和神经网络架构上的实验表明，CDC-FM始终提供更好的质量-泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和高度非均匀采样数据集上显著优于标准流匹配。

Conclusion: CDC-FM为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间的相互作用提供了数学框架，并提供了一个可轻松集成到现有流匹配流程中的鲁棒且可扩展的算法。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Motivation: 高维数据在机器学习中普遍存在，现有基于LLM的特征选择方法缺乏结构化推理和透明决策依据。

Method: 设计多智能体架构，让多个LLM智能体扮演不同角色进行"辩论"，集体评估特征相关性并生成详细理由。

Conclusion: 该审议架构增强了决策透明度和计算效率，使LLM-FS-Agent成为实际应用的实用可靠解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出通过基于正确性而非置信度来校准解码规则，以平衡LLM在复杂推理任务中的探索性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在增加探索性（高温度采样）和提高可靠性（拒绝低置信度样本）之间存在冲突，混淆了不同来源的不确定性。

Method: 提出三种简单策略：Greedy-Threshold在低置信度步骤进行贪婪采样；Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中显示出性能提升。

Conclusion: 挑战了关于不确定性下解码的流行启发式方法，证明基于正确性校准的解码策略更有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性至关重要，但实际应用中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能显式表示模型不确定性，在小数据场景下特别有价值。

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分方法，比较了5种贝叶斯和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用5000个或更少训练样本的实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小训练数据场景下的OOD检测中表现更优，验证了利用模型不确定性的价值。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值区域中Gibbs算法的泛化性能，特别是在训练误差很低但数据可能不合理（如随机标签）的情况下，提供可验证的泛化边界。

Method: 使用数据依赖的边界分析方法，结合Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行近似，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 边界在真实标记数据上产生非平凡预测，并能正确上界随机标签的测试误差，表明低温度插值区域的泛化性能已在经典高温度区域的小训练误差中体现。

Conclusion: Gibbs算法在过参数化插值区域具有可验证的泛化性能，且低温度插值区域的泛化能力可通过高温度区域的训练误差来预测。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

Motivation: 为了解决分子表示中特征泄露问题，并降低留一法交叉验证的计算成本，开发一种高效且无偏的分子向量化方法。

Method: 提出molFTP表示方法，采用虚拟掩码技术防止特征泄露，并使用key-LOO近似分子级LOO，实现接近全数据训练的同时保持无偏性能估计。

Result: key-LOO与真实分子级LOO的偏差低于8%，在数据集上表现出强预测性能，同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、防泄露的片段-靶标流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或key-LOO等实用保障措施，以低成本近似LOO效果。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: H-DSAC框架成功将人类专业知识融入强化学习，为真实世界自动驾驶提供了安全高效的学习方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖外部预训练模型，难以分离数据选择效果与外部模型影响，且忽视数据在模型收敛时的长期影响。

Method: 使用小型代理模型作为LLM替代，通过双层优化训练评分模型，上层优化评分模型为训练样本分配权重，下层优化训练代理模型至收敛。

Result: 在410M/1B/2.8B Pythia和LLaMA-0.5B模型上验证，1B模型设置下比现有最优方法快1.7倍达到相同性能。

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种无需外部模型的轻量级数据选择方案，能有效提升LLM预训练效率和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 编辑流过程提供了一个灵活高效的时序点过程模型，有效减少了生成过程中必要的编辑操作数量。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Conclusion: 通过控制过度平滑，深度图神经网络可以在某些任务中超越浅层网络，通过合理分布邻接跳数避免模型过参数化或欠参数化。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

Motivation: 当前AI模型越来越多地用于数据分析和可视化，但基准测试很少针对散点图特定任务，限制了对其性能的深入了解。

Method: 创建了一个包含6个数据生成器和17种图表设计的合成标注数据集，使用N-shot提示法评估OpenAI和Google的专有模型在五个不同任务上的表现。

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在聚类计数任务上表现良好（准确率90%+），但在定位相关任务上表现不佳（精确率和召回率接近或低于50%），图表设计对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: 虽然某些AI模型在散点图分析任务上表现良好，但在定位任务上仍有改进空间，建议避免使用宽高比过大或随机着色的散点图。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

Method: 使用输入输出数据构建矩张量来恢复混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，然后通过卡尔曼EM算法进行细化，对所有LDS参数提供闭式更新

Result: 在合成数据上，Tensor-EM比纯张量方法或随机初始化EM方法具有更可靠的恢复能力和更强的鲁棒性。在真实神经数据上成功建模和聚类不同条件

Conclusion: MoLDS为建模复杂神经数据提供了有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

Motivation: RLHF虽然能对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，但其内部学习的奖励信号难以解释，现有IRL方法对所有偏好对一视同仁，忽略了最具信息量的失败示例。

Method: 开发了失败感知IRL算法，重点关注被提取的奖励模型错误分类或评分接近的示例，通过这些失败案例学习来恢复定义模型行为的潜在奖励。

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督，且提取的奖励能更好地反映RLHF的真实目标。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是审计模型对齐和减少IRL过程模糊性的稳健、可扩展方法，能更有效地支持重新RLHF训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法依赖间接启发式标准（如问题难度或轨迹长度），而指令调优探索了更广泛的自动选择策略，但很少在推理背景下应用。高质量推理数据的定义仍不明确

Method: 提出使用影响力函数衡量单个CoT示例对下游准确率的因果效应，定义推理数据质量，并引入基于影响力的剪枝方法

Conclusion: 影响力函数为定义推理数据质量提供了有效方法，基于影响力的数据选择策略在数学推理任务中表现优异

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD)框架，通过二元分类器近似图分布的Jensen-Shannon距离，解决了现有基于MMD的图生成模型评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图生成模型评估方法主要依赖基于图描述符的MMD指标，这些指标只能相对排序模型，无法提供绝对性能度量，且对内核和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同描述符间的结果不可比较。

Method: 通过拟合二元分类器来区分真实图和生成图，使用图描述符进行特征化，分类器的数据对数似然近似于两个分布间JS距离的变分下界。

Result: PGD指标被约束在单位区间[0,1]内，可在不同图描述符间进行比较，并推导出理论上有依据的汇总指标，为给定描述符提供最紧密的距离下界。

Conclusion: 实验表明PGD相比MMD指标提供了更稳健和深入的评估，PolyGraph基准框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中模型压缩技术通常只关注尺寸与准确性的权衡，忽视了模型忠实性，这在医疗、金融等高风险领域尤为重要。

Method: 引入忠实性评估指标，包括使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化。

Result: 实验表明高准确性不能保证忠实性，统计测试能检测到标准指标（如准确性和均等机会）遗漏的微妙但显著的变化。

Conclusion: 所提出的指标提供了一种实用且更直接的方法，确保通过压缩获得的效率提升不会损害可信AI所需的公平性或忠实性。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了lm-Meter，第一个专为设备端LLM推理设计的轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够实时捕获细粒度的阶段级和内核级延迟，为设备端LLM系统优化提供关键性能洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地集成到日常应用中，但基于云的部署方式引发了数据隐私和可持续性担忧。在移动和边缘设备上本地运行LLM可以增强隐私性、可靠性和降低通信成本，但由于内存和计算需求大，以及在资源受限硬件上性能-效率权衡的可见性有限，实现这一愿景仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了lm-Meter，一个轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够在无需辅助设备的情况下捕获细粒度的实时延迟，包括嵌入、预填充、解码、softmax、采样等阶段级和内核级延迟。在商用移动平台上实现，并验证了其高分析精度和低系统开销。

Result: lm-Meter在商用移动平台上实现了高分析精度，在Powersave调控器下仅导致预填充阶段吞吐量降低2.58%，解码阶段降低0.99%。通过lm-Meter进行的实证研究揭示了设备端LLM推理中的阶段级和内核级瓶颈，量化了精度-效率权衡，并识别了系统性优化机会。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上LLM的运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为知情优化奠定了基础，并加速了设备端LLM系统的民主化进程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

TL;DR: LEXPOL是一个基于语言条件的混合策略架构，通过自然语言任务描述来选择或组合多个子策略，实现多任务强化学习，无需任务特定重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来指导不同目标的行为，但如何有效利用这些元数据来索引和组合可重用技能仍是一个挑战。

Method: 使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择或混合多个子策略，支持跨任务的端到端训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上达到或超过强大多任务基线，且能通过语言门控组合专家策略来处理新任务描述和未见任务组合。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以有效地索引和重组单个策略内的可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

*Aleksandar Armacki,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了去中心化随机梯度下降(DSGD)算法在高概率收敛方面的理论保证，消除了现有研究中对梯度一致有界等强假设，证明了DSGD在轻尾噪声下具有与均方误差收敛相同的条件，同时实现了非凸和强凸代价函数的最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件，如梯度一致有界或渐近消失噪声，导致高概率收敛与均方误差收敛的条件存在显著差距，这与中心化设置中SGD在相同条件下同时保证两种收敛的情况形成对比。

Method: 通过仔细分析感兴趣量（梯度范数平方或最优性间隙）的矩生成函数和用户间共识间隙的矩生成函数，提供了去中心化方法在高概率意义下的方差缩减效应新结果，并对强凸代价函数的矩生成函数给出了更精细的边界。

Result: 证明了DSGD在轻尾噪声下具有与均方误差收敛相同的条件，无需梯度一致有界等限制性假设，同时实现了非凸和强凸代价函数的最优收敛速率，并展示了用户数量的线性加速效果。

Conclusion: DSGD在高概率意义下保持了强大的性能，与现有的均方误差保证相匹配，填补了去中心化设置中高概率收敛理论的重要空白。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为策略不可知的人类代理，生成模拟人类决策的合成数据，以解决异构智能体团队中与策略不可访问或非平稳队友（如人类）协作的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的人工参与数据，限制了可扩展性。需要一种更高效的方法来训练智能体与人类队友协作。

Method: 在基于Stag Hunt博弈的网格世界捕获游戏中进行了三个实验：1）比较人类参与者、专家和LLMs的决策一致性；2）通过提示诱导风险敏感策略；3）在动态网格世界中测试LLMs生成移动动作的能力。

Result: LLMs在决策一致性上更接近专家，能通过提示模拟人类的风险敏感行为，生成的轨迹与人类参与者路径相似。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs尚不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略不可知队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Method: 通过从定制先验中采样合成数据进行持续预训练，扩展现有模型的能力，使其能够处理超过50,000个特征的高维数据。

Result: TabPFN-Wide模型在性能上匹配或超越基础模型，对噪声具有更好的鲁棒性，能够无缝扩展到50,000+特征，同时保持固有的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于先验信息的适应是增强基础模型处理高维数据能力的有效方法，在真实生物医学数据集中识别出的相关特征与已有生物学发现重叠，并为未来研究提供潜在起点。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了可解释AI领域的现有框架，为分析复杂特征交互提供了理论基础

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Method: 对开源语言模型训练轨迹进行综合分析（最大32B参数和15T训练token），并在受控实验中训练自己的模型（最多100B token），研究训练动态干预措施。

Result: 关键发现是量化误差由学习率与其他训练超参数的复杂交互驱动。一旦学习率衰减，验证损失和量化误差就会发散，这与训练数据规模基本无关。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了增加数据集规模会固有地损害量化效果的假设，证明策略性训练超参数干预可以在大规模训练中提高量化质量。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

### [353] [Stratified GRPO: Handling Structural Heterogeneity in Reinforcement Learning of LLM Search Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06214)
*Mingkang Zhu,Xi Chen,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Stratified GRPO方法来解决LLM搜索代理中轨迹结构异质性导致的跨层偏差问题，通过分层优势归一化在同类轨迹内计算优势值，显著提升了训练效果和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具解决复杂多步问题时，搜索轨迹存在结构异质性，导致标准策略梯度方法出现跨层偏差，扭曲信用分配并阻碍复杂搜索策略的探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹结构特性将轨迹划分为同质层，在每层内局部计算优势值，确保轨迹只与同类轨迹比较。

Result: 在多样单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO比GRPO性能提升高达11.3分，获得更高训练奖励、更好训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层方法为LLM搜索代理中的结构异质性提供了原则性解决方案，证明了分层优势归一化能有效消除跨层偏差，提升RL训练效果。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

### [354] [A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds - Stabilized finite element formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05119)
*Roger A. Sauer*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了一个稳定的有限元公式，用于自演化流形上的Navier-Stokes流动的任意拉格朗日-欧拉表面理论，适用于大变形和复杂流体表面系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理如肥皂膜、毛细管弯月面和脂质膜等复杂且本质上不稳定的流体表面系统，这些系统需要物理框架不变、适用于大变形的数值方法。

Method: 使用基于二次有限元和隐式时间积分的稳定压力-速度（或表面张力-速度）公式，通过膜弹性确定未知的ALE网格运动，实现面内网格运动的稳定化而不影响系统物理行为。

Result: 新公式在多个具有挑战性的示例中得到了验证，包括自演化表面上的剪切流动和具有部分流入的膨胀肥皂泡，所有情况下都获得了最优收敛率。

Conclusion: 该稳定有限元公式成功解决了自演化流形上Navier-Stokes流动的数值模拟问题，特别是C1连续表面离散化（如基于NURBS的方法）表现出特别优势。

Abstract: This work presents a stabilized finite element formulation of the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) surface theory for Navier-Stokes flow on
self-evolving manifolds developed in Sauer (2025). The formulation is
physically frame-invariant, applicable to large deformations, and relevant to
fluidic surfaces such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid membranes,
which are complex and inherently unstable physical systems. It is applied here
to area-incompressible surface flows using a stabilized pressure-velocity (or
surface tension-velocity) formulation based on quadratic finite elements and
implicit time integration. The unknown ALE mesh motion is determined by
membrane elasticity such that the in-plane mesh motion is stabilized without
affecting the physical behavior of the system. The resulting three-field system
is monolithically coupled, and fully linearized within the Newton-Rhapson
solution method. The new formulation is demonstrated on several challenging
examples including shear flow on self-evolving surfaces and inflating soap
bubbles with partial inflow on evolving boundaries. Optimal convergence rates
are obtained in all cases. Particularly advantageous are C1-continuous surface
discretizations, for example based on NURBS.

Conclusion: 开放共享成像数据集对于确保可重复性、促进跨学科整合和支持多孔介质系统稳健预测框架的发展至关重要。

Abstract: Understanding processes in porous media is fundamental to a broad spectrum of
environmental, energy, and geoscience applications. These processes include
multiphase fluid transport, interfacial dynamics, reactive transformations, and
interactions with solids or microbial components, all governed by wettability,
capillarity, and reactive transport at fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces.
Laboratory-based multiscale imaging provides critical insights into these
phenomena, enabling direct visualization and quantitative characterization from
the nanometer to meter scale. It is essential for advancing predictive models
and optimizing the design of subsurface and engineered porous systems. This
review presents an integrated overview of imaging techniques relevant to porous
media research, emphasizing the type of information each method can provide,
their applicability to porous media systems, and their inherent limitations. We
highlight how imaging data are combined with quantitative analyses and modeling
to bridge pore-scale mechanisms with continuum-scale behavior, and we
critically discuss current challenges such as limited spatio-temporal
resolution, sample representativity, and restricted data accessibility. We
conduct an in-depth analysis on open-science trends in experimental and
computational porous media research and find that, while open-access publishing
has become widespread, the availability of imaging data and analysis code
remains limited, often restricted to 'upon request'. Finally, we underscore the
importance of open sharing of imaging datasets to enable reproducibility,
foster cross-disciplinary integration, and support the development of robust
predictive frameworks for porous media systems.

TL;DR: 本文对细长收敛管道中层流轴对称流动的流体动力学入口区域进行了分析研究，发现收敛几何形状缩短了入口长度，并通过数值模拟验证了理论模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有许多关于恒定截面圆管中发展流动的基础研究，但实际应用中常使用收敛管道，需要将分析扩展到缓慢变化截面的管道。

Method: 采用经典方法将流动径向分为两个区域：壁面区域（粘性效应主导，忽略对流）和中心核心区域（同时考虑惯性和粘性效应），扩展了直管发展流动的近期分析。

Result: 收敛几何形状施加了有利的压力梯度，在相同入口雷诺数下比直管缩短了流体动力学入口长度。理论模型与完整Navier-Stokes方程的数值模拟结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: 该模型为细长收敛管道入口区域中层流边界层发展与压力梯度之间的相互作用提供了简洁的理论描述。

Abstract: The hydrodynamic entrance region in internal conduits, where the velocity
profile evolves to a fully developed state, is a classical problem in fluid
mechanics. Although many fundamental studies involve developing flows in
circular ducts with constant area -- for which several theoretical descriptions
exist -- converging pipe sections are often employed, demanding the extension
of the analysis to pipes with slowly varying areas. This work presents an
analytical investigation of the hydrodynamic entrance region in laminar
axisymmetric flows through slender converging pipes at moderate Reynolds
numbers. The theoretical model extends the recent analysis for developing flows
in straight pipes by adopting a classical approach where the flow is divided
radially into two regions: a wall region, where viscous effects are dominant
and advection is neglected, and a central core, where both inertia and viscous
effects are considered. The effects of the inlet Reynolds number and the inlet
angle on the developing velocity profile and pressure drop are analysed.
Results show that a converging geometry, which imposes a favourable pressure
gradient, shortens the hydrodynamic entrance length compared to a straight pipe
at the same inlet Reynolds number. The analytical solutions for the evolution
of the velocity field are validated against numerical simulations of the full
Navier-Stokes equations, showing good agreement. The model provides a concise
theoretical description of the interaction between boundary-layer development
and pressure gradients in the entrance region of laminar flows in slender
converging pipes.

Abstract: We discover a frozen state in decaying turbulent coagulation where the moment
ratio M_C stabilizes at 4.5, defying the theoretical prediction of 2 for

Global non-equilibrium thermodynamics extends this framework to include
physical systems in stationary states (Ho{\l}yst et al., EPL 149, 30001
(2025)). Here, we demonstrate that this extended theory captures macroscopic
motion in stationary states, thereby providing a unified framework for global

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解新界面形成后达到表面张力平衡所需的时间对于准确测量至关重要，虽然表面张力与粘度无关，但平衡时间受粘度影响。

Method: 使用三种常用方法进行实验：悬滴法、Wilhelmy板法和气泡压力法，建立不同粘度流体所需的最小表面年龄。

Result: 提出了包含相图的指导原则，帮助用户选择最适合的测量方法和可达到的最年轻表面年龄，确保测量不受粘度影响。

Conclusion: 该指导原则使3D打印服装、喷涂、涂层等应用领域的用户能够准确测量动态和静态表面张力，不受粘度效应影响。

Abstract: Dynamic surface tension measurements play a critical role in interfacial
activities for liquids with varying viscosities. Understanding the rate at
which the interface attains the equilibrium, for surface tension measurements,
after the formation of a new interface is of significant interest. Although
surface tension is independent of viscosity, the time required for a new
surface to form (equilibrium/relaxation time) is influenced by viscosity. The
measured surface tension value is accurate only once these viscous effects have
subsided. Therefore, the relaxation time represents the minimum surface age
value achievable during the measurement process. We experimentally established
the minimum surface age needed to measure the dynamic and static surface
tension of a fluid with a specific viscosity using three widely used methods:
the Pendant drop method, the Wilhelmy plate method, and the Bubble pressure
method. We propose a guideline with a phase plot that helps to choose the most
suitable method and the youngest achievable surface age for an accurate
measurement, independent of viscous effects. This guideline enables users in
diverse applications such as 3D printed clothing, spray paint, coating, etc.,
to accurately measure dynamic and static surface tension without being
influenced by viscosity effects.

Method: 采用膨胀生成器框架，通过领先的膨胀生成器特征向量识别准稳态的几乎不变集族，在三维湍流中进行数据驱动分析。

Result: 成功提取了瞬态特征热传递模式作为经历瞬态演化的几乎不变集族，这些模式对对流热传递的贡献最小。

Conclusion: 膨胀生成器框架在三维湍流中有效识别了对热传递贡献最小的瞬态特征模式，为理解对流热传递机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Horizontally extended plane-layer convection flows are characterized by
characteristic patterns of turbulent heat transfer due to the convective fluid
motion consisting of a nearly-regular ridge network where hot fluid rises and
cold fluid sinks. Here, we analyse this transport behavior by the so-called
inflated generator framework, which identifies quasi-stationary families of
almost-invariant sets, derived from leading inflated generator eigenvectors. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven analysis framework in
three-dimensional turbulent flow, by extracting transient characteristic heat
transfer patterns as families of almost-invariant sets subject to a transient
evolution, which contribute least to the convective heat transfer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小尺度加权诊断的方法，通过分析$|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2$谱的峰值波数变化，可以提前预测三维湍流耗散峰值的到达时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测三维湍流何时达到耗散峰值对于理论和自适应算法在模拟与实验中都至关重要，但现有方法难以提供早期预警。

Method: 使用直接数值模拟(DNS)研究Taylor-Green涡旋，引入$|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2$谱作为诊断工具，该谱对于不可压缩流等效于$k^4$加权的能量谱。

Result: 发现$|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2$谱的峰值波数$k_{\rm peak}$在耗散率$\varepsilon(t)$达到最大值之前就快速上升到中-小尺度并趋于稳定，呈现出稳健的时间顺序$t_k<t_\varepsilon<t_\Pi$。

Conclusion: 该诊断方法简单易算，能有效识别高曲率结构的早期形成，为湍流耗散峰值提供可靠的早期预警信号。

Abstract: Predicting when a three-dimensional turbulent flow reaches its dissipation
peak is essential for both theory and adaptive algorithms in simulations and
experiments. Using direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the Taylor--Green
vortex (TGV) at resolutions of $256^3$--$1024^3$, we introduce and test a
small-scale weighted diagnostic: the spectrum of $|\nabla \times
\boldsymbol{\omega}|^2$ (with $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla \times \mathbf{u}$),
which, for incompressible flow, is equivalent to a $k^4$-weighted energy
spectrum. We show that the peak wavenumber of this spectrum, $k_{{\rm
peak}}[\,|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\,]$, advances rapidly to
intermediate--small scales and then levels off \emph{before} the dissipation
rate $\varepsilon(t)=\sum_k 2\nu k^2 E(k)$ reaches its maximum. Across all
resolutions, we observe robust temporal ordering $t_k<t_\varepsilon<t_\Pi$,
where $t_k$ marks the onset of the rapid rise of $k_{{\rm peak}}[\,|\nabla
\times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\,]$, $t_\varepsilon$ is the time of the maximal
$\varepsilon(t)$, and $t_\Pi$ is when the cumulative flux $|\Pi(K)|$ attains
its largest peak scale. This early-warning signal correlates with the
morphological transition to filament-dominated structures visible in
$Q$-criterion isosurfaces and is consistent with integral-scale trends
($L_{{\rm int}},\lambda,\eta$). The diagnostic is simple to compute from
standard DNS data and highlights the incipient formation of high-curvature
structures, where viscosity acts most strongly.

TL;DR: 该论文推广了MHD发电机理论中的必要判据，引入了径向变化的权重函数f(r)，并针对球形发电机提出了基于速度和应变的改进下界雷诺数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的发电机作用必要判据要么基于速度场的最大模量（Childress型），要么基于速度场的最大应变（Backus型），作者希望对这些判据进行推广，引入径向变化的权重函数来提高判据的准确性。

Method: 引入径向变化的权重函数f(r)，计算对应的下界雷诺数R_lb^C[f]（基于速度）和R_lb^B[f]（基于应变）。考虑两种权重类型：幂律分布f(r)=r^α（0≤α≤2）和依赖于速度场v的最优径向分布f_v。

Result: 对于已知的高效s2t2速度场和最近确定的'最有效'速度场，比较了加权临界雷诺数与下界雷诺数。对于最优分布，Backus型比值R_c^B/R_lb^B约为6.4，而无权重时该比值约为16.3。

Conclusion: 引入径向变化的权重函数显著提高了发电机作用判据的准确性，最优径向分布使得Backus型判据的比值从16.3降低到6.4，表明新方法能更好地逼近实际的临界条件。

Abstract: In MHD dynamo theory well-known necessary criteria for dynamo action are
formulated in terms of lower bounds either on the maximum modulus of the
velocity field (Childress-type) or the maximum strain of the velocity field
(Backus-type). We generalize these criteria for spherical dynamos by
introducing a radially varying weight $f(r)$. The corresponding {\em l}ower
{\em b}ound Reynolds numbers $R_{lb}^C [f]$ (based on velocity) and $R_{lb}^B
[f]$ (based on strain) are determined for two types of such weights: a power
law profile $f(r) = r^\alpha$, $0\leq \alpha \leq 2$ and an optimal radial
profile $f_v$ depending on the velocity field $\bf{v}$ in question.
  To assess the quality of these lower bounds we compare them with weighted
critical Reynolds numbers $R_c^C$ (Childress-type) and $R_c^B$ (Backus-type),
respectively, for the onset of dynamo action of the well known efficient
$s_2t_2$ velocity field (Dudley \& James 1989) and a recently determined ``most
efficient'' velocity field (Chen et al.\ 2018). For the latter field we find a
Backus-type ratio $R^B_c /R^B_{lb}$ of about $6.4$ with the optimal profile
compared to a ratio of about $16.3$ without weight.

Conclusion: 新算法具有优势，但存在局限性，讨论了其在效率方面的改进程度，包括无需采样整个流场的特点。

Abstract: To simulate highly-resolved flow fields, we extend the Quantum Lattice
Boltzmann Method (QLBM) to be able to simulate multiple time steps without
state extraction or reinitialization. We adjust and extend given QLBM
approaches from the literature to completely remove the need to measure or
reinitialize the flow field in between the simulation time steps. Therefore,
our algorithm does not require to sample the entire flow field at any time. We
solve the linear advection-diffusion problem and derive all necessary equations
and build the corresponding quantum circuit diagrams, including details on the
QLBM blocks and explicitly drawing the circuit gates. We discuss the general
decay of a QLBM step and how that effects our algorithm. The new algorithm is
verified on 1D and 2D test cases using the shot method of IBMs Qiskit package.
We show excellent agreement and convergence between our QLBM and classical LBM
methods. The conclusion section includes a discussion on the advantages of our
algorithm as well as limitations and to what extent it is more efficient.

Motivation: 传统基于Boussinesq涡粘性假设的RANS闭合模型在校准标准流动时，对平均流动和湍流统计量的预测往往不准确。本文旨在改进圆柱绕流在不同雷诺数(3,900-100,000)和马赫数(0-0.3)范围内的预测精度。

Method: 收集交叉验证数据集，包括水动力PIV、气动PIV以及高精度谱元DNS和LES数据。使用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，通过未闭合的RANS方程进行训练，仅从边界信息推断速度场和雷诺应力强迫项。

Result: 数据分析揭示了雷诺应力在参数空间中的普遍分布规律。基于PINNs的闭合方法显著改进了传统RANS模型对平均流动和湍流统计量的预测精度。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的PINN闭合方法为RANS建模提供了有效的新途径，能够显著提升对复杂流动的预测能力。

Abstract: Traditional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) closures, based on the
Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis and calibrated on canonical flows, often
yield inaccurate predictions of both mean flow and turbulence statistics. Here,
we consider flow past a circular cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers
(3,900-100,000) and Mach numbers (0-0.3), encompassing incompressible and
weakly compressible regimes, with the goal of improving predictions of mean
velocity and Reynolds stresses. To this end, we assemble a cross-validated
dataset comprising hydrodynamic particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a towing
tank, aerodynamic PIV in a wind tunnel, and high-fidelity spectral element DNS
and LES. Analysis of these data reveals a universal distribution of Reynolds
stresses across the parameter space, which provides the foundation for a
data-driven closure. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
trained with the unclosed RANS equations, to infer the velocity field and
Reynolds-stress forcing from boundary information alone. The resulting closure,
embedded in a forward PINN solver, significantly improves RANS predictions of
both mean flow and turbulence statistics relative to conventional models.

convective time scale) on drop deformation is studied and explained by
examining the electric, elastic and viscous stresses at the interface. For
small deformations, we apply the method of domain perturbations, and show that
the viscoelastic properties of the drop significantly influence its deformation
more than when the surrounding fluid is viscoelastic. Numerical computations
are performed using a finite volume framework for larger drop deformations. The
transient dynamics of the drops show distinct oscillatory patterns before
eventually stabilizing at a steady deformation value. We observe a trend of
decreased deformation in both configurations as the Deborah number increases.
Relative magnitude of normal and tangential stresses plays a crucial role in
drop deformation.

Abstract: Near-surface turbulent flows beneath a free surface are reconstructed from
sparse measurements of the surface height variation, by a novel neural network
algorithm known as the SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED). The reconstruction of
turbulent flow fields from limited, partial, or indirect measurements remains a
grand challenge in science and engineering. The central goal in such
applications is to leverage easy-to-measure proxy variables in order to
estimate quantities which have not been, and perhaps cannot in practice be,
measured. Specifically, in the application considered here, the aim is to use a
sparse number of surface height point measurements of a flow field, or drone
video footage of surface features, in order to infer the turbulent flow field
beneath the surface. SHRED is a deep learning architecture that learns a
delay-coordinate embedding from a few surface height (point) sensors and maps
it, via a shallow decoder trained in a compressed basis, to full subsurface
fields, enabling fast, robust training from minimal data. We demonstrate the
SHRED sensing architecture on both fully resolved DNS data and PIV laboratory
data from a turbulent water tank. SHRED is capable of robustly mapping surface
height fluctuations to full-state flow fields up to about two integral length
scales deep, with as few as three surface measurements.
