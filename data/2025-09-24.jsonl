One such principle states that a system conserving two\nsign-definite invariants self-organizes into large-scale structures. Ordinary\nthree-dimensional turbulence does not fall within this paradigm. However, when\nsubject to rotation, 3D turbulence is profoundly altered: rotation produces 3D\ninertial waves, while also sustaining emergent two-dimensional structures and\nfavoring domain-scale flows called condensates. This interplay raises a\nfundamental question: why and when are 2D flows sustained even when only 3D\nwaves are excited? Using extensive numerical simulations of the rotating 3D\nNavier-Stokes equations together with a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory, we\nshow that near-resonant interactions between 3D waves and a large-scale 2D flow\nimpose an additional conservation law: inertial waves must conserve their\nhelicity separately for each helicity sign. This emergent sign-definite\ninvariant constrains the waves to transfer their energy to large-scale 2D\nmotions. However, as rotation increases, resonance conditions become more\nrestrictive and the energy transfer from 3D to 2D progressively vanishes,\nleading to a transition from condensate-dominated turbulence to pure\ninertial-wave turbulence for the 3D modes. We derive analytical expressions for\nthis 3D-2D energy transfer as a function of rotation, Reynolds number and\ndomain geometry, and verify them numerically. Together, these results establish\na mechanism underlying two-dimensionalization in rotating turbulence, and, more\nbroadly, illustrate how wave-mean flow interactions can drive large-scale\nself-organization."}

A similar overshoot occurs in\nlarge-eddy simulations (LES) when an eddy viscosity model is used. It is not a\nviscous phenomenon but is caused by error in the residual stress model. This\nartificial bottleneck effect in LES leads to an over-prediction of kinetic\nenergy even when a dynamic procedure is used to capture the spectral decay at\nthe cutoff scale. Recently, Johnson [2022, J. Fluid Mech., 934, A30] introduced\na generalization of spatial filtering that provides a dynamic procedure without\na test filter. In this paper, this method of Stokes flow regularization (SFR)\nis used with kinetic energy considerations to generate a range of LES models\nand explore the bottleneck effect in more detail. The coefficients for each\ndynamic model are determined locally, without averaging over homogeneous\ndirections. A posteriori tests of the models in isotropic turbulence are\nreported, demonstrating the robustness of the SFR-based procedure for different\nmodel forms and enabling fair comparisons in terms of their impact on the\nbottleneck effect.

This\nmechanism is especially important when dissolution is suppressed by\nheterogeneity in the pore space and the residual oil.

A plateau appears in the\nwall-normal distribution of the streamwise velocity, with a value significantly\nlower than that of its freestream counterpart.

To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score.

We address this zero-shot setting by\nproposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the\ninductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior\n(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual\nloss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel\nfidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,\nand remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels.

To address this gap, we propose \"anecdoctoring\", a novel\nred-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across\nlanguages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking\nwebsites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies\n(US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and\ncharacterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we\naugment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and\noffers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting.

To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and\nAdaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel\ncomponents: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture\nmulti-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive\nfusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable\ncross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nLEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in\nboth efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent\nperformance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability."}

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context.

To circumvent\nthe prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs\nupcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its\nfeed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert\ndiversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This\npaper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using\nexperts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained\nmodels (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact\nthat these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter\nspace, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To\novercome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to\nharmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture.

We introduce Conversational\nOrientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese\nconversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing\negocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed\nscenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which\nintegrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a\nstructured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)\nmapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.\nA curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on\nTaiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of\nresource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%\norientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,\nsubstantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,\nMCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including\nASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also\nmaintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic\nvariation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight\nthe potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward\ninterpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation."}

To advance 3D reconstruction\nin mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset\nfeaturing diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror\nmasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in\nreflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of\n3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary\nviewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and\nrecovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that\nReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and\ntraining speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich\nenvironments."}

Even\nwith high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can\nweaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address\nthese issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal\nconsistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally\nstable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an\nEcho-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic\ninformation from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based\nencoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further\nintroduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,\nwhich uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce\ntemporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS\nand EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation\naccuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal\nconsistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical\nechocardiography."}

Successive generations, including GPT-o\nseries, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale\nRL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the\nlong-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy\nresponses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model\nand rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits\nscalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in\nReinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the\nrollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the\ntarget number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for\ncontinuation in future steps.

This methodological shift allows, for the first time,\nthe direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this\nforecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural\nNetwork and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to\nsimultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the\ngenerated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful\nmachine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO\nregression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate\nthat the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and\nspatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this\ntask. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models\noften default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of\nour integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of\nground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of\nspatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting."}

In this paper we concern with the\ncharacteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and\ndifferences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and\nclustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first\ncase, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard\ndeviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form\nStandard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of\nmodels. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection\nmatrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with\nthe same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the\ncorrelation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these\ntwo vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly\nshow the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after\nconducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found\nthat the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is\ndirectly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different\nweights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high\nconsistency with the pre-trained model."}

Existing models\nfor predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive\naccuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are\nfurther challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise\nonly a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score.

We identify two primary weaknesses\ncontributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene\ncorrespondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than\nrelying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we\ncreate synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These\ndatasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic\ncontext and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this\nknowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of\ntwo key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse\nweather distillation.

To deal with these two challenges, a\nMulti-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage\naccident anticipation from dashcam videos.

Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

Yet current video benchmarks focus\nlargely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the\nchallenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering\nextended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation\nMLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and\nnavigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark\nconsisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a\nchallenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'\ngeospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high\nscores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended\nspatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in\nwhich we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights\ngained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations\nverify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but\nalso translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications."}

Theoretical results\nhave formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and\ncan solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input\nembedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,\nenabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning\nbenchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs\nmatch discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing\ngreater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario\nis to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,\nmeaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show\ncontinuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model\non out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model."}

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."}
