### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用的Oracle排序器替代训练好的奖励模型，通过基于排名的反馈来优化大型视频语言模型，降低了微调成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈的成本急剧增加。现有的RLAIF方法依赖专门的奖励模型，这种流水线既昂贵又受限。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非评分，并引入基于GRPO的$GRPO_{rank}$排名损失函数，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: 实验证明Oracle-RLAIF在各种视频理解基准测试中持续优于使用现有微调方法的领先VLM。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为创建灵活且数据高效的大型多模态视频模型对齐框架开辟了新路径，通过基于排名而非分数的强化学习实现模型对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人机协作面部识别系统的准确率提升条件，探索如何有效结合人类和机器的优势来提高决策质量。

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作效果，应用近端准确率规则(PAR)建立关键融合区域，实施智能人机融合策略。

Result: 协作效益随合作者基线准确率差异减小而增加，智能人机融合比单独机器或所有人机判断组合更准确，能有效最小化低表现人类的影响。

Conclusion: 人机协作在面部识别中具有重要价值，智能融合策略为实现AI在面部识别中的智能应用提供了基于证据的路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是首个针对生成式视频模型不确定性量化的研究，提出了一个包含评估指标、黑盒UQ方法和数据集的框架，能够分解预测不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式视频模型像大语言模型一样会产生幻觉，生成看似合理但事实错误的视频，但目前缺乏视频模型的不确定性量化方法，存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出了S-QUBED框架：基于鲁棒秩相关估计的校准评估指标；利用潜在建模分解预测不确定性的黑盒UQ方法；以及用于基准测试的UQ数据集。

Result: 实验表明S-QUBED能够计算与任务准确度负相关的校准总不确定性估计，并有效分解偶然性和认知性不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了视频模型不确定性量化的空白，提出的框架能够可靠地量化视频生成模型的不确定性，为安全应用提供重要保障。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)的新方法，通过优化简单提示的文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，无需重新训练模型。

Method: 使用预训练扩散模型作为骨干，通过三重目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化后文本嵌入的一致性、最小化与初始提示的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估证实了该方法的有效性，在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO是一种无需训练、与骨干模型无关的有效方法，能够显著提升简单提示下生成图像的美学质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多相机系统，用于在真实野外条件下捕获精确的3D手部和物体数据，解决了现有数据集在环境多样性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部跟踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，需要开发能够在无约束真实环境中进行精确3D手部跟踪的方法。

Method: 结合轻量级背戴式捕捉装置（8个外中心相机）和Meta Quest 3头显（2个自我中心视图），设计了一个自我-外中心跟踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 通过收集包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，证明了该方法能够显著减少环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为在真实野外条件下进行精确3D手部跟踪提供了一种有效的解决方案，克服了现有数据集的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将多步扩散视频模型蒸馏为少步学生模型的方法，通过输入人体姿态条件引导注意力和损失函数，实现实时性能并提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的语音驱动视频生成方法因大量去噪步骤和昂贵注意力机制而速度缓慢，无法实现实时部署。

Method: 使用输入人体姿态关键点的准确对应关系来引导注意力到相关区域（如人脸、手部、上半身），提出输入感知稀疏注意力减少冗余计算；引入输入感知蒸馏损失提升唇部同步和手部运动真实性。

Result: 方法实现了实时性能，并在视觉质量上优于最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，该方法在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理效率，为实时语音驱动视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FunLoRA的新方法，通过使用仅包含秩1矩阵的低秩适应机制来解决生成模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需依赖合成数据重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在持续学习过程中面临灾难性遗忘问题，传统方法依赖合成数据重训练会导致训练时间不断增加和性能长期退化，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 设计了基于低秩适应(LoRA)的功能性条件机制FunLoRA，专门使用秩1矩阵，并通过精心选择的函数增加重新参数化矩阵的秩，实现动态条件调节。

Result: 实验表明FunLoRA在基于流匹配的模型上超越了基于扩散模型的现有最佳结果，达到更高的分类准确率，同时仅需部分内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA方法能够有效避免灾难性遗忘，只需在当前任务数据上训练，实现了参数高效微调，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双视野、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一的三层防御堆栈显著降低攻击成功率和风险误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全，现有方法缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视野感知以及数字和自然退化鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于多源数据集构建双视野框架，使用特征压缩、防御性蒸馏和基于熵的异常检测的三层防御堆栈，结合序列时间投票进行增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈达到79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，高风险误分类降至32%。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种操作设计域下显著提高了交通灯和标志识别的鲁棒性和安全性，通过物理可转移性验证了有效性。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [11] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个针对流匹配模型中强化学习的噪声扰动优化方法，通过迭代搜索策略优化噪声分布，提高奖励和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有方法通过随机噪声扰动效率低且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强的场景优化，解决了传统方法需要密集校准视图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法大多需要密集校准视图，而从自由稀疏图像重建往往由于有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集且几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用基于贡献的剪枝消除局部漂浮物，并在快速优化期间利用深度和多视图特征监督与可微分相机参数缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从自由稀疏图像实现高质量的表面重建，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验来提升运动合成的精度和个性化能力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法存在两个主要限制：1）难以捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和驱动行为的人类意图；2）缺乏视觉基础导致无法指定细粒度的时空细节。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，引入混合注意力机制实现条件token与运动子序列的有效局部对齐，并构建了440小时的Mo440H基准数据集。

Result: 微调后，MoGIC在HumanML3D和Mo440H上分别将FID降低了38.6%和34.6%，在运动描述任务中超越基于LLM的方法，并能进行意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，显著推进了可控运动合成和意图理解的能力，展示了统一多模态生成框架的有效性。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的运动自适应框架有效解决了控制点分配与运动复杂度不匹配的根本问题，实现了更高质量的动态3D重建。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理真实噪声复杂性；深度学习需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面表现优异，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: Net2Net通过结合无监督和监督网络的混合方法，有效解决了真实世界噪声去除的挑战，具有良好的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提升检索准确性，解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的高计算成本和训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务存在高计算成本（多候选推理消耗大量token）和训练不稳定性问题。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量，提出新的训练范式：使用检索定制合成CoT数据集进行激活阶段，然后采用课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Retrv-R1通过创新的信息压缩和训练范式设计，成功将R1风格推理应用于多模态检索任务，实现了性能、效率和泛化能力的平衡。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

TL;DR: BCA+是一个无需训练、无需反向传播的测试时适应框架，通过动态缓存机制和贝叶斯推理，在目标识别和检测任务中实现高效适应，提升模型在分布偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然适应而忽略先验的重要性。BCA+旨在解决这些问题，为视觉语言模型提供统一的适应框架。

Method: 引入动态缓存机制，自适应存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度（用于检测）以及基于历史预测的自适应类别先验。将适应问题建模为贝叶斯推理，通过不确定性引导的融合机制结合初始模型输出和基于缓存的预测。

Result: 在识别和检测基准测试中达到最先进的性能，同时保持高效性，无需训练和反向传播。

Conclusion: BCA+通过双适应机制（语义理解和上下文置信度校正）和不确定性引导融合，为视觉语言模型提供了有效的测试时适应解决方案，在保持高效的同时显著提升分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于脑肿瘤分类的分层广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），通过结合分层聚类和对比学习，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别，在OpenSRH数据集上比现有GCD方法准确率提升28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义的固定类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。无监督学习缺乏利用标注数据先验知识的能力，而半监督方法通常假设所有潜在类别都在标注数据中。

Method: 将分层聚类与对比学习相结合，在基于对比学习的GCD方法基础上引入半监督分层聚类损失函数，以捕捉脑肿瘤分类学的层次结构。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，HGCD-BT在斑块级分类中比最先进的GCD方法准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在数字脑肿瘤图谱的HE染色全玻片图像上也验证了其跨成像模态的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能够有效识别已知和未知的脑肿瘤类别，在脑肿瘤分类中具有重要应用价值，且具有良好的跨模态泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key是一种无需训练的关键帧采样模块，通过最大化统一的相关性-多样性目标，为长视频理解提供信息丰富且非冗余的关键帧选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中存在关键时刻遗漏、冗余抑制过度以及忽视查询相关性等问题，需要一种能平衡相关性和多样性的采样策略。

Method: 提出RD-MV目标函数，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，并采用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐查询。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的广泛实验表明达到了最先进的性能，特别是在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一种无需训练、计算高效且即插即用的方法，能显著提升长视频理解性能。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在复杂横向思维挑战(如字谜)中的认知过程和失败模式仍不明确，现有研究仅显示模型在这些任务上表现不佳，但缺乏深入分析。

Method: 创建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别；开发了将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架；研究了三种提示策略以引出不同类型的解释过程。

Result: 发现推理质量在不同谜题类别中差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本性限制；提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性应被视为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略对模型认知过程有重要影响，揭示了视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务中的系统性优势和局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Motivation: 现有文本移除研究主要关注自然图像中的场景文本，但当前数据集存在领域泛化能力差、评估不准确的问题，特别是SCUT-EnsText等基准存在人工编辑导致的地面真值伪影、背景过于简单以及评估指标无法捕捉生成结果质量等局限性。

Method: 通过目标感知放置和视觉语言模型生成内容，在复杂背景上渲染文本，合成文本移除基准数据集，确保干净的地面真值和具有挑战性的文本移除场景。

Result: 创建了一个适用于场景文本之外领域的文本移除基准数据集，该数据集已在Hugging Face上公开可用。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集合成方法解决了现有文本移除基准的局限性，为跨领域文本移除任务提供了更准确和具有挑战性的评估工具。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个简单、检测器无关的框架，通过模态上下文注意力(MoCA)和查询表示对齐(QueryREPA)来对齐DETR风格对象查询与模态上下文，解决多模态医学目标检测中的统计异质性和表示空间不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一检测器在混合医学模态(如CXR、CT、MRI)上训练时，由于统计异质性和不相交表示空间导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 1) 定义模态标记：紧凑的文本衍生嵌入编码成像模态；2) 通过MoCA将模态标记集成到检测过程中，通过自注意力混合对象查询表示；3) 引入QueryREPA预训练阶段，使用任务特定对比目标对齐查询表示与模态标记。

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时，以最小开销持续提高AP，无需架构修改，为稳健的多模态医学目标检测提供了实用路径。

Conclusion: MoCA和QueryREPA共同产生模态感知、类别忠实的查询，能有效迁移到下游训练，显著提升多模态医学目标检测性能。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题，即生成与输入视觉和文本内容相矛盾的内容。现有方法如对比解码和注意力操作存在对比样本构建困难、敏感性高和稳定性不足的问题。

Method: 提出图像头掩码对比解码(MaskCD)，利用LVLMs中的图像头，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Conclusion: MaskCD是一种有效的缓解LVLMs幻觉问题的方法，通过掩码图像头构建对比样本，在保持模型性能的同时减少幻觉生成。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Conclusion: 通过渐进增强和自适应权重学习机制，结合因果约束的模态身份保持，Med-K2N有效解决了K到N医学图像生成中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更灵活的模态重建能力。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Motivation: 需要开发准确、非破坏性的鸡蛋质量评估方法，以确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业禽类生产效率。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别虽然降低了存储和计算成本，但存在动态信息粗糙噪声大以及RGB和运动模态融合不足的问题。

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用多尺度块和去噪模块增强表示学习，通过SMC和CMA模块加强模态间交互。

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: MEACI-Net能够有效解决压缩视频动作识别中的关键问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的零样本图像描述框架，从图像中心转向补丁中心范式，无需区域级监督即可描述任意区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本描述器局限于全局表示和整图描述，无法描述图像中的特定区域

Method: 将单个图像补丁作为原子描述单元，通过聚合补丁特征来描述任意区域（从单个补丁到非连续区域和整图）

Result: 使用DINO等生成有意义的密集视觉特征的主干网络，在多个基于区域的描述任务中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效，在零样本密集、区域集和新引入的轨迹描述任务中表现优异

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，通过K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的未知物体，在多个基准测试中超越监督和无监督基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉基础模型在闭集语义任务中表现出色，但其在语义分割中检测分布外区域的能力尚未充分探索。研究这些模型是否能在无异常监督的情况下区分分布内和分布外区域。

Method: 使用InternImage骨干网络提取特征，应用K-Means聚类结合解码器原始logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类，整个过程无需训练。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，使用InternImage-L模型超越了多个监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明这是一种有前景的通用分布外分割方法方向，需要最少的假设或额外数据。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间裁剪中自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token捕获全局视觉上下文而非孤立特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大。现有基于注意力的剪枝方法倾向于保留语义相似的token，在高剪枝率下性能显著下降。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角进行token剪枝，自适应地在不同空间裁剪中分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能捕获全局视觉上下文。

Result: 在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下都优于现有方法。例如，LLaVA1.5配备HoloV在剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，在保持高性能的同时显著提升推理效率，实现了优越的效率-精度权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

### [31] [Zero-Shot Robustness of Vision Language Models Via Confidence-Aware Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02913)
*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，包含置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化，在保持泛化能力的同时提升干净和对抗样本的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW能够有效提升视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在保持泛化能力的同时显著改善对抗攻击下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型在整合超声成像与临床数据用于颈动脉粥样硬化风险评估中的表现，发现现有模型在风险分类方面表现不佳，但通过领域适应和多模态整合可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，且需要透明可解释的方法供临床医生使用。

Method: 提出了一个模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源LVLM模型，包括通用模型和医学专用模型。使用低秩适应( LoRA)对LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna进行超声领域适应，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示现有LVLM在准确识别成像模式和解剖结构方面存在困难，风险分类表现差。经过领域适应后，卒中风险分层性能显著提升，多模态数据整合进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率，性能可与传统CNN基线相媲美。

Conclusion: LVLM在超声心血管风险预测中既有前景也有局限性，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多期相增强MRI合成方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，且缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进特征分离效果和模型效率。

Method: 使用Flip Distribution Alignment VAE，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE为多期相增强MRI合成提供了一种轻量级且可解释的解决方案，在保持合成质量的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准和TIT评估方法，用于评估长提示文本到图像生成的质量，解决了现有模型对长详细提示理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但在理解和遵循长而详细的提示方面表现不佳，生成结果不一致，需要专门的评估基准和方法。

Method: 构建了包含200个平均长度超过250词的长提示基准LPG-Bench，并提出了基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估方法，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现。

Result: 实验表明现有T2I评估指标与人类偏好一致性差，而TIT方法显著优于CLIP-score等基线方法，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提升7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进T2I模型发展提供了新的视角和工具，所有资源将公开。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法存在速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，需要开发更实用和可扩展的3D编辑解决方案。

Method: 构建了3DEditVerse数据集（116,309个训练对和1,500个测试对），并提出3DEditFormer条件变换器，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控来解耦可编辑区域和保留结构。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架在定量和定性评估上都优于现有最先进基线，为实用和可扩展的3D编辑设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 提出的3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型成功解决了3D编辑的关键挑战，实现了无需辅助3D掩码的精确一致编辑。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在热带云层常见地区实用性有限，需要解决云遮挡光学图像的问题，同时缓解深度学习网络中编码器下采样导致的空间和光谱细节丢失问题。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级NDI注入方法，将归一化差异指数注入最终解码层以保留关键空间特征；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据与光学数据进行融合。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net和DeepLabV3在无云图像上的性能分别提升1.99%和2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型中均获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: NDI注入方法能有效增强土地覆盖分割性能，雷达-光学数据融合在挑战性大气条件下具有显著优势，为热带地区土地覆盖监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event

Conclusion: 高效架构结合针对性的不平衡处理可以提供实用、透明且可复现的面部表情识别解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Motivation: 理解视觉生成模型中促进或抑制组合泛化（生成已知概念的新组合）的机制，目前仍不完全清楚，需要进行系统研究。

Method: 通过受控实验研究不同设计选择的影响，重点关注训练目标的离散/连续性质以及条件信息量，并基于发现提出用连续JEPA目标增强离散MaskGIT模型的方法。

Result: 识别出两个关键因素：训练目标的离散/连续分布特性，以及训练期间条件信息对组成概念的覆盖程度。

Conclusion: 通过用辅助连续JEPA目标松弛MaskGIT的离散损失，可以改善离散模型在组合泛化方面的性能。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征与纯视觉特征的对比效果，发现几何基础特征包含更多几何细节但反而降低了姿态估计精度，而纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在辐射场语义蒸馏中，几何基础语义特征是否比纯视觉特征在空间任务中更具优势，特别是针对姿态估计等需要几何感知的任务。

Method: 提出了SPINE框架，包含基于蒸馏语义的粗反转和基于光度优化的细反转两个核心组件，用于无初始猜测的辐射场反转。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，在姿态估计任务中精度反而下降。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中具有更好的通用性，未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

### [43] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个基于3D几何引导的图像补全框架，通过双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，在目标视图与参考图像差异较大时仍能保持几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当目标视图与参考图像差异显著时，现有的生成方法仅依赖扩散先验而缺乏几何线索，容易产生不对齐或不合理的内容。

Method: 提出双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征；采用目标感知掩码策略来引导模型关注相关参考线索。

Result: 实验显示GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比最先进方法提升了17.1，显著提高了几何准确性同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过整合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到有声视频生成中的两个关键挑战：(1)共享文本标题导致的模态干扰问题，(2)跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉基础字幕框架生成解耦的视频和音频字幕，并设计BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双向交叉注意力机制实现对称的信息交换。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验和人工评估表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了T2SV任务中的模态干扰和跨模态交互问题，为未来研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域，分别提取结构信息和语义特征，结合潜在扩散先验和CLIP嵌入，使用Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像，显著提升了复杂场景下脑活动重建图像的结构和语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建复杂视觉刺激时面临挑战，因为自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，而高级特征由于上下文重叠存在语义纠缠。受视觉皮层层次表示理论启发，需要开发能分离处理不同层次特征的方法。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验；语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入；通过Versatile Diffusion模型集成这些组件合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，HAVIR在复杂场景下也能提升重建图像的结构和语义质量，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR模型通过层次化分离和处理视觉皮层的不同特征，有效解决了复杂视觉刺激重建中的挑战，为脑活动到视觉信息的重建提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码输入，通过预测动作轨迹来生成高质量的人机交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂的动态交互，且获取精确掩码标注在现实应用中具有挑战性。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：先预测执行者和物体的运动轨迹，再基于轨迹生成视频。支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来引导运动轨迹。

Result: 在涵盖人机交互和机器人操作场景的两个基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架在无需密集掩码输入的情况下，实现了高质量的交互中心视频生成，具有出色的灵活性和控制能力。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是导致残疾的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要跨X光、CT和MRI在特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 与执业脊柱外科医生共同设计，采用两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订）构建SpineMed-450k数据集，包含45万条指令实例，涵盖问答、多轮咨询和报告生成。

Conclusion: 临床医生评估证实了该模型输出的诊断清晰度和实际效用，为脊柱AI诊断提供了高质量的数据集和评估标准。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Conclusion: UniShield系统通过多智能体框架有效解决了伪造图像检测和定位中的跨领域泛化问题，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Conclusion: ROGR方法能够高效实现任意环境光照下的重光照，无需针对每种光照进行优化或光传输模拟，在多个数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our

Result: 在PSNR上达到37dB，比之前工作的27dB显著提升；FID、LPIPS和CMMD分数降低高达96%；能够无缝集成到预训练扩散模型中，实现更快、更高效的生成，或在不增加成本的情况下将输出分辨率提高一倍。

Conclusion: PQGAN展示了产品量化作为图像合成中离散潜在表示的强大扩展，为超参数选择提供了指导，并揭示了VQ和PQ在扩展嵌入维度时的相反性能行为。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了Memory Forcing学习框架，通过几何索引空间记忆和混合训练协议，解决视频扩散模型在有限计算预算下长期空间一致性与新场景生成质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在Minecraft游戏等应用中需要平衡探索新场景时的自然内容生成与重访已探索区域时的空间一致性。现有方法中，仅使用时间记忆缺乏长期空间一致性，而添加空间记忆又可能导致模型过度依赖不充分的空间上下文而降低新场景生成质量。

2. 链式前向训练：通过模型滚动扩展自回归训练，链式预测产生更大的姿态变化，鼓励依赖空间记忆保持一致性
3. 点对帧检索：通过将当前可见点映射到源帧来高效检索历史

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架通过精心设计的训练协议和几何索引空间记忆，成功解决了视频扩散模型中长期空间一致性与新场景生成质量之间的权衡问题，为世界建模和交互式场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Method: 利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜在空间，捕捉模态间复杂依赖关系，实现灵活而鲁棒的跨模态检索。

Result: MonSTeR优于仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，用户研究验证了检索分数与人类偏好的一致性，并在零样本场景物体放置和运动描述任务中表现出多功能性。

Conclusion: MonSTeR成功构建了运动-场景-文本的统一表示空间，为跨模态对齐评估提供了有效工具，在多个下游任务中展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入微小平移扰动来对抗对抗性攻击，无需额外训练或特定攻击类型调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑，会导致信息损失，需要一种能最小化信息损失同时增强鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 对输入图像引入微小平移扰动，对齐变换后的特征嵌入，聚合后再映射回原始参考图像，采用闭式公式实现。

Result: 在图像分类中恢复68.1%的准确率损失，立体匹配中恢复71.9%，光流中恢复29.2%，首次为密集预测任务建立通用测试时防御。

Conclusion: 该方法完全免训练、架构无关、攻击无关，具有出色的通用性和实用性，在多种任务上实现最先进的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，未对整体网络架构进行重大改进，需要新的随机网络架构来提升纹理表示学习。

Method: 使用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块，通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示，捕获通道内和通道间关系。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理识别任务中表现出色，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RULER tokens和I-MRoPE方法，解决GUI grounding任务中VLM在高分辨率显示上的坐标映射问题，显著提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的补丁到像素映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示上失效。现有方法通过文本token直接生成坐标，迫使模型隐式学习复杂的位置到像素映射，导致在新分辨率上精度下降和失败增多。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型能够像地图上的网格线一样参考位置，而不是从零开始生成坐标；2. 交错MRoPE(I-MRoPE)改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度得到平等表示，解决标准位置方案的不对称性问题。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，该方法在grounding精度上获得一致提升，在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAML是一个标签高效的多模态大语言模型适应框架，利用少量标注数据和大量未标注图像，通过伪问答对生成和选择性神经元更新，在医学影像等专业领域实现高效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉基准上表现良好，但在医学影像等专业领域的分布外任务中表现不佳，因为标注数据有限且昂贵。

Method: 使用QA生成器生成领域相关的伪问答对，通过标题蒸馏进行正则化，并选择性更新与问答最相关的神经元，使QA生成器在蒸馏过程中有效获取领域特定知识。

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA任务上的实验表明，LEAML在最小监督条件下始终优于标准微调方法。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域中具有显著效果，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

### [59] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL是一种高效的对比激活引导算法，通过将激活引导的好处直接融入模型权重，让LLM能够回答已知问题并拒绝回答未知问题，减少幻觉30%-40%，且计算和数据效率比基线方法高30倍和20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉，自信地提供错误答案而不是承认无知。现有激活引导方法需要在推理时实时监控和干预，不够实用。

Method: CASAL连接可解释性与摊销优化，仅训练单个Transformer层的子模块，通过对比激活引导将知识表示直接编码到模型权重中。

Result: 在多个短问答基准测试中减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍，数据效率高20倍，在OOD领域有效泛化，适用于密集和MoE模型。

Conclusion: CASAL是将可解释性方法应用于实际生产系统的有前景的进展，为缓解LLM幻觉问题提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

TL;DR: RA-FSM是一个基于GPT的模块化研究助手，通过有限状态机控制生成过程，结合向量检索和确定性引用管道，为技术领域提供透明、可验证的答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在文献综述中产生幻觉和错误引用的问题，提升在专家工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 采用有限状态机控制循环（相关性->置信度->知识），结合向量检索和确定性引用管道，通过分层知识库构建和模块化处理流程。

Result: 在光子学领域的评估中，专家盲测显示RA-FSM优于Notebook LM和标准GPT API，具有更好的边界条件处理和证据使用能力。

Conclusion: RA-FSM设计强调透明度和可验证性，适用于高风险技术工作，并可推广到其他科学领域。

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时S2S模型缺乏深度知识和语义理解，而级联系统虽然知识丰富但延迟高的问题，旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 采用混合架构，用户语音同时通过S2S变换器进行即时响应，并传递给后端LLM，LLM的文本响应实时注入以指导S2S语音生成。

Result: 在MT-Bench语音合成变体上的评估显示，系统在回答正确性上显著优于基线S2S模型，接近级联系统水平，同时保持与基线相当的延迟。

Conclusion: 该混合架构成功弥合了实时S2S模型和知识丰富级联系统之间的差距，实现了低延迟和高知识准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

TL;DR: AMANDA是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型代理框架，通过内在和外在医学知识增强来解决医学视觉问答中的推理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学多模态大语言模型在低资源环境下表现不佳，主要存在两个推理瓶颈：内在推理瓶颈忽略医学图像细节，外在推理瓶颈无法整合专业医学知识。

Method: 提出训练自由的代理框架AMANDA，通过内在医学知识增强（粗到细的问题分解）和外在医学知识增强（生物医学知识图谱检索）来增强推理能力。

Result: 在8个Med-VQA基准测试中，零样本和少样本设置下都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: AMANDA框架有效解决了医学多模态大语言模型的推理瓶颈问题，在低资源医学视觉问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is

TL;DR: SelfJudge是一种通过目标模型自监督训练验证器的推测解码方法，通过评估语义保留来接受有轻微差异的候选标记，实现更快的LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的判断解码方法依赖人工标注或可验证真实值的任务，限制了在不同NLP任务中的通用性。

Method: 通过目标模型自监督训练验证器，通过评估标记替换后的响应是否保留原始响应的语义来衡量语义保留。

Result: 实验显示SelfJudge在推理-准确率权衡方面优于判断解码基线方法。

Conclusion: SelfJudge为更快的LLM推理提供了一个广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

TL;DR: 提出EntropyLong方法，通过预测不确定性验证长距离依赖质量，构建包含真实长距离依赖的训练数据，显著提升模型在长上下文理解任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文语言模型训练方法（如通用文本拼接或基于启发式的方法）经常无法保证真正的长距离依赖关系，需要专门的数据构建方法。

Method: 利用预测不确定性识别文档中的高熵位置，从大型语料库中检索语义相关上下文，并通过评估是否降低预测熵来验证其效用，构建包含验证依赖关系的训练样本。

Result: 在RULER基准测试中表现显著提升，特别是在需要远距离信息的任务上；指令微调后在LongBenchv2上也取得实质性进展，证明长上下文理解能力增强。

Conclusion: 基于熵的验证对于长上下文训练是必要且有效的，能够确保依赖关系代表可测量的信息增益而非虚假相关性。

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

Motivation: 语言模型在对话推荐系统中潜力巨大，但缺乏公开的CRS数据使得微调变得困难。现有的用户模拟器方法缺乏行为一致性，生成的对话序列与真实用户行为不符。

Method: 开发了一种结合行为模拟器和语言模型提示的方法，生成与用户底层状态一致的自然对话，并创建了包含偏好获取和示例批评的大型开源CRS数据集。

Result: 评估显示生成的对话在一致性、事实性和自然性方面表现良好，证明了该方法能够产生高质量的CRS训练数据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了CRS数据稀缺问题，为训练基于语言模型的对话推荐系统提供了有效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为look-ahead Sync的新方法，克服了SyncPool在容量上的限制，同时保持其可证明的安全性保证。该方法仅在真正不可区分的token序列上执行最小同步采样，同时策略性地保留所有其他可区分路径以最大化嵌入容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言隐写术面临tokenization模糊性的根本挑战，可能导致灾难性解码失败。SyncPool方法通过粗粒度同步机制解决了模糊性问题，但牺牲了嵌入容量，因为它将模糊组的全部香农熵仅用于同步而非有效载荷嵌入。

Method: look-ahead Sync方法：1）仅在真正不可区分的token序列上执行最小同步采样；2）策略性地保留所有其他可区分路径；3）提供理论安全性证明；4）分析可实现嵌入容量与理论上界之间的差距。

Result: 在英语（使用Llama 3）和中文（使用Qwen 2.5）基准测试中，该方法持续接近理论容量上界，显著优于SyncPool。嵌入率的提升在英语中超过160%，在中文中超过25%，特别是在具有较大候选池的设置中。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用高容量可证明安全语言隐写术迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior

compatibility in a reusable framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了FormalML基准测试，用于评估LLMs在数学证明子目标补全任务中的表现，发现在复杂研究级背景下LLMs在准确性和效率方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs作为数学家实际助手的潜力，填补复杂证明中缺失的步骤，解决子目标补全这一挑战性任务。

Method: 构建FormalML基准测试，使用Lean 4从机器学习基础理论中提取4937个问题，通过翻译策略将过程性证明转换为声明性形式。

Result: 评估最先进的证明器显示，在准确性和效率方面存在持续局限性，特别是在复杂研究级背景下。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来实现有效的子目标补全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Hadi Veisi,Hussein M. Al*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了第一个库尔德语语义文本相似度数据集，包含10,000个句子对，涵盖正式和非正式语域，并建立了可复现的评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然高资源语言有丰富的语义文本相似度资源，但低资源语言如库尔德语仍然缺乏相关数据集，这限制了相关NLP任务的发展。

Method: 构建了10,000个库尔德语句子对数据集，涵盖正式和非正式语域，每个句子对都标注了相似度。使用Sentence-BERT、多语言BERT等强基线模型进行基准测试。

Result: 获得了有竞争力的结果，同时凸显了库尔德语形态学、正字法变异和语码混合带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基线模型建立了一个可复现的评估套件，为库尔德语语义学和低资源NLP的未来研究提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap
between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist
for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset
and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong
starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

*Ishak Soltani,Francisco Belo,Bernardo Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRACQ是一个多维评估框架，专门用于评估文档在五个特质上的表现：连贯性、严谨性、适当性、完整性和质量。该框架基于特征自动作文评分方法，扩展应用于机器生成文本的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单一评分方法无法全面评估机器生成文本的质量，需要开发一个能够提供多维、可解释评估的框架。

Method: 基于特征自动作文评分方法，整合语言、语义和结构信号进行累积评估，支持整体和特征级别的分析。在500份合成资助提案上进行训练，并与LLM作为评判者进行基准测试。

Result: 初步结果表明，CRACQ比直接使用LLM评估产生更稳定和可解释的特征级别判断，但在可靠性和领域范围方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: CRACQ提供了一个有前景的多维评估框架，能够对机器生成文本进行更细致的评估，但需要进一步改进可靠性和扩展应用领域。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO强化学习和DocLens评估器的临床文本生成框架，直接优化事实准确性和完整性，无需单独训练奖励模型或依赖人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文档需要与完整性、事实准确性等优先事项精确对齐，现有方法存在训练成本高、依赖人工参考等问题。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)强化学习框架，结合DocLens声明级评估器提供确定性、基于对话的奖励信号，采用简单的奖励门控策略降低训练成本。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了临床笔记质量，GPT-5定性评估显示在事实性、完整性和简洁性方面获得更高偏好，遗漏和幻觉更少。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到真实世界场景，能够整合自定义目标如指南依从性或计费偏好，改进效果可能代表保守的下限估计。

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在基于计算论证的论证性大语言模型(ArgLLMs)中集成不确定性量化方法，发现简单的直接提示策略比复杂方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键决策中的应用增加，确保其可靠性变得至关重要。不确定性量化方法可以帮助评估LLM输出的可信度，特别是在论证性LLM框架中。

Method: 在论证性LLMs中集成不同的LLM不确定性量化方法，并在声明验证任务上进行实验评估，同时该方法本身也是评估UQ方法有效性的新途径。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管简单，直接提示在ArgLLMs中是一种有效的UQ策略，显著优于更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 在论证性LLM框架中，简单的直接提示不确定性量化方法比复杂方法表现更好，这为LLM可靠性评估提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究通过提示方法让大语言模型模拟早期知识截止点的能力，发现提示方法在直接查询时有效，但在处理因果相关但未直接询问的遗忘内容时效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间预测任务中依赖预训练数据存在污染问题，准确预测可能反映的是记忆而非推理能力，导致对其泛化能力的高估。研究能否通过提示让LLMs模拟早期知识截止点。

Method: 构建三个评估数据集来测试LLMs遗忘能力：(1)直接事实知识、(2)语义变化、(3)因果相关知识。使用基于提示的模拟知识截止方法。

Result: 提示方法在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在处理与查询因果相关但未直接询问的遗忘内容时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明在将LLMs应用于时间预测任务时需要更严格的评估设置，提示方法在诱导遗忘方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种利用现实世界用户不满意信号进行偏好训练的新方法，通过动态采样正面响应，在多个基准测试中显著提升模型性能，特别是在大规模模型上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界LLM部署中，用户不满意信号（如修正、迭代）很丰富，而显式满意反馈却很稀缺。现有偏好学习方法与这种数据分布不匹配，需要昂贵的人工标注或假设有大量正面响应。

Method: DRIFT方法以现实世界不满意信号为基础，从不断演化的策略中动态采样正面响应进行训练，避免了梯度退化问题。

Result: 在WildBench和AlpacaEval2基准测试中，DRIFT模型相比基础模型提升了6.23%-12.29%的性能，14B模型甚至超越了GPT-4o-mini。同时保持了探索能力，产生更多样化的高奖励解决方案。

Conclusion: DRIFT是现实世界后训练的有效且可扩展的方法，能够充分利用最丰富和最有信息量的用户信号。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

TL;DR: SIMPACT是一个用于构建社交模拟数据集和评估LLM代理行为的工具包，包含Blueprint数据集，专注于政治话语分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏用于微调和评估LLM作为真实社交代理的标准数据资源，需要解决这一空白。

Method: 提出SIMPACT框架，构建行为基础的社交数据集，将下一动作预测作为训练任务，引入集群和群体层面的评估指标。

Result: 发布了Blueprint数据集，基于Bluesky数据，包含12种社交互动类型，支持上下文依赖的代理开发。

Conclusion: SIMPACT为推进严谨、符合伦理的社交模拟提供了基础，Blueprint可作为评估基准和构建领域特定数据集的模板。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于动态专家聚类和结构化压缩的统一框架，解决MoE LLMs中的负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销三大难题，实现了80%参数减少、10-20%吞吐量提升和三倍负载方差降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE大语言模型面临的三大核心问题：负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销，这些因素限制了MoE模型的实际部署效率。

Method: 使用动态专家聚类方法，基于参数和激活相似性定期重新分组专家；在集群内将专家权重分解为共享基础矩阵和极低秩残差适配器；采用两阶段分层路由策略和异构精度方案。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上的评估显示，该框架在保持标准MoE模型质量的同时，总参数减少约80%，吞吐量提升10-20%，专家负载方差降低超过三倍。

Conclusion: 结构重组是实现可扩展、高效和内存有效的MoE大语言模型的原则性路径。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Motivation: 探索在教育领域开发可持续的AI教学助手，解决生成式AI和大型语言模型在教育应用中计算资源消耗大、依赖云基础设施的问题。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，对8个开源小型语言模型(LLaMA 3.1、IBM Granite 3.3、Gemma 3等，7-17B参数)进行基准测试，并与GPT-4o进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，通过适当的提示和针对性检索，小型语言模型能够提供与大型语言模型同样准确且符合教学要求的回答。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型因其较低的计算和能源需求，在消费级硬件上即可实时使用，不仅成本效益高、保护隐私，而且环境友好，是教育机构实现可持续、节能个性化学习的可行AI教学助手。

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

TL;DR: 提出mini-vec2vec方法，在保持vec2vec对齐效果的同时大幅提升效率和稳定性，使用线性变换实现文本嵌入空间的无监督对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vec2vec方法虽然能实现近乎完美的文本嵌入空间对齐，但存在计算成本高、不稳定的问题，需要更高效可靠的替代方案。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：伪并行嵌入向量初步匹配、变换拟合和迭代优化，最终学习得到线性变换映射。

Result: mini-vec2vec在效率上比原始vec2vec提升数个数量级，同时达到或超过其性能表现，具有高度稳定性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法的高效性和稳定性使其能够扩展到新领域，为文本嵌入空间对齐的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL是对WikiSQL数据集的系统性修订和转换，旨在解决原数据集的结构和标注问题，为LLM时代提供更清洁的自然语言问题和完整SQL查询的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集在早期NL2SQL研究中发挥重要作用，但由于存在大小写敏感不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误和未回答问题等结构性和标注问题，其使用率下降。需要为现代LLM提供更清洁、更适合的基准。

Method: 对WikiSQL中的错误进行分类，并实施自动化的清理和重新标注方法。将原始数据集转换为提供清洁自然语言问题和完整SQL查询的纯文本格式。

Result: 评估了多个大型语言模型（包括Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B等）在新基准上的表现。LLMSQL作为LLM就绪的基准，相比为指针网络模型设计的原始WikiSQL，更适合现代自然语言转SQL模型。

Conclusion: LLMSQL不是对WikiSQL的简单更新，而是专门为LLM时代设计的基准，提供清洁的输入输出对，支持现代模型的直接生成和评估。

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在采用特定政治和文化视角时如何评估政治言论的攻击性，理解模型在不同意识形态和语言背景下的表现差异

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集中2020年美国选举推文的多语言子集，评估多个LLMs从不同政治立场（极右、保守、中立、进步）判断推文攻击性，涵盖英语、波兰语和俄语语境

Result: 具备明确推理能力的大模型（如DeepSeek-R1、o4-mini）在意识形态和文化变化方面表现更一致和敏感，而小模型往往无法捕捉细微区别

Conclusion: 推理能力显著提高了攻击性判断的个性化和可解释性，表明这种机制对于使LLMs适应跨语言和意识形态的复杂社会政治文本分类至关重要

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估语音对话模型中的偏见，发现闭源模型偏见较低，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务会放大跨群体差异，且偏见在多轮对话中可能持续存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型中的偏见已被研究，但具有音频输入输出的语音对话模型中的偏见特性尚未被探索。副语言特征（如年龄、性别、口音）可能影响模型输出，多轮对话可能加剧偏见，影响决策和推荐任务的公平性。

Method: 使用群体不公平分数（GUS）评估决策偏见，基于相似性的归一化统计率（SNSR）评估推荐偏见，测试了开源模型（Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice）和闭源API（GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash），并研究了多轮对话中重复负面反馈的影响。

Result: 闭源模型通常表现出较低的偏见，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务倾向于放大跨群体差异，且偏见决策在多轮对话中可能持续存在。

Conclusion: 这是首个对端到端语音对话模型偏见的系统研究，为开发公平可靠的音频交互系统提供了见解，并发布了FairDialogue数据集和评估代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类语言系统中语义表征的抽象程度，验证语言皮层是否存在形式独立的抽象意义表征。

Method: 使用视觉和语言模型生成句子对应的图像和释义，提取嵌入向量，通过聚合多个图像和平均多个释义的嵌入来预测语言皮层神经响应。

Result: 多图像聚合和多释义平均均能提高预测准确度，丰富上下文细节的释义甚至优于原始句子的预测效果。

Conclusion: 语言皮层中存在高度抽象、形式独立的语义表征，其语义表征比语言模型更丰富和广泛。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

TL;DR: DiffuSpec是一个免训练框架，使用预训练扩散语言模型在单次前向传播中生成多令牌草稿，通过因果一致性路径搜索和自适应草稿长度控制器解决扩散模型生成的非因果性问题，实现高达3倍的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，自回归解码的串行特性导致延迟增加。现有的推测解码方法仍依赖自回归草稿器，其顺序处理限制了实际加速效果。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型进行多令牌草稿生成，引入因果一致性路径搜索从令牌网格中提取左到右路径，以及自适应草稿长度控制器根据接受反馈动态调整提案大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DiffuSpec实现了高达3倍的时钟时间加速，证明了基于扩散的草稿生成作为自回归草稿器的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: 扩散基草稿生成为推测解码提供了稳健的替代方案，能够显著提升推理速度，同时保持与标准自回归验证器的兼容性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

Motivation: 当前排放相关知识分散且专业化，现有排放数据访问和编译方法效率低下，阻碍非专家解读排放信息，给研究和管理带来挑战。

Method: 基于精心策划的知识库，集成提示工程和问题补全技术，支持自然语言交互式排放数据分析，包括查询可视化清单、分析来源贡献、推荐排放因子等。

Conclusion: Emission-GPT的模块化和可扩展架构促进了传统手动工作流程的自动化，使其成为下一代排放清单开发和基于情景评估的基础工具。

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉默螺旋理论原本针对人类社会，但LLM作为代理时，纯统计语言生成是否会产生类似动态？这需要新的评估框架来研究。

Method: 提出评估框架，系统控制历史信息和角色信息的可用性，使用趋势测试和集中度测量来分析意见动态。

Result: 实验表明：历史+角色信息共同产生强烈的多数主导；仅历史信息导致强锚定效应；仅角色信息产生多样但不相关的意见。

Conclusion: 研究连接了计算社会学和负责任AI设计，强调需要监控和缓解LLM代理系统中出现的从众现象。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkLLM是一个轻量级可插拔的训练框架，通过QK适配器和分块适配器来解决Transformer自注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但由于自注意力机制对输入token的二次复杂度导致计算效率低下。现有的分块选择和压缩方法存在语义不完整或训练推理效率差的问题。

Method: 提出ChunkLLM框架，包含两个组件：QK适配器（用于特征压缩和分块注意力获取）和分块适配器（用于检测分块边界）。训练时冻结主干网络参数，仅训练适配器，并设计了注意力蒸馏方法来提高关键分块的召回率。推理时仅在检测到分块边界时触发分块选择。

Result: 在多个长短文本基准数据集上的实验表明，ChunkLLM在短文本基准上达到相当性能，在长上下文基准上保持98.64%性能，同时保留48.58%的键值缓存。在处理120K长文本时，相比原始Transformer实现了最高4.48倍的加速。

Conclusion: ChunkLLM有效解决了Transformer的计算效率问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理速度，为长文本处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析多个大语言模型在不同语言和语境下对争议性罗马尼亚历史问题的回答，评估其偏见和不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到历史常因文化和国家意识形态而被扭曲呈现，大语言模型基于特定数据集训练可能缺乏中立性，会将偏见传递给用户。

Method: 研究分三个阶段进行：先让LLM对问题给出肯定回答，然后要求用数值量表重新回答相同问题，测试回答方式对答案的影响。

Result: 二元回答稳定性相对较高但不完美，且因语言而异；模型常在不同语言或格式间改变立场；数值评分常与初始二元选择不一致；最一致的模型不一定最准确或中立。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在特定语言语境下存在不一致性的倾向，表明LLM的回答易受提问方式和语言环境影响。

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖环境级手册和任务级指导，但忽略了实例级上下文的重要性。在复杂任务中，缺乏对具体环境实例中可验证事实的认知是导致失败的主要原因。

Method: 采用任务无关的方法，通过TODO森林进行引导式探索，结合轻量级的计划-执行-提取循环，自动生成高精度的可重用上下文文档。

Result: 在TextWorld、ALFWorld和Crafter上的实验显示，ReAct在TextWorld中的平均成功率从37%提升到95%，IGE从81%提升到95%，在效率和成功率方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过将一次性探索转化为持久可重用的知识，该方法补充了现有上下文，使LLM智能体更加可靠和高效。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在推理时检索的上下文知识与预训练获得的参数知识之间的冲突问题，避免模型要么盲目接受外部知识而容易受错误信息影响，要么固守参数知识而无法从检索中获益。

Method: 在合成传记语料库上训练基于Transformer的语言模型，系统控制各种训练条件，包括文档内事实重复、信息不一致性和分布偏差等。

Result: 实验表明文档内事实重复促进了参数和上下文能力的发展；包含不一致信息或分布偏差的语料库训练鼓励模型发展稳健的知识仲裁策略。

Conclusion: 非理想属性（如信息不一致、分布偏差）对于学习稳健的知识仲裁很重要，这些发现为预训练模型和谐整合参数和上下文知识提供了具体经验指导。

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Motivation: 现代语言模型的性能提升依赖于参数规模扩展，但将所有世界知识压缩到参数中既没必要（每个提示只使用一小部分知识）也不实用（边缘设备内存和计算资源有限）。

Method: 采用内存增强架构和与现有硬件范式对齐的预训练策略，构建小型语言模型访问大型分层参数化内存库，在预训练和推理时提取上下文相关的内存块。

Result: 160M参数模型增强18M参数内存（从4.6B内存库提取）的性能与参数超过2倍的常规模型相当，分层前馈内存在不同Transformer架构中都能稳健工作。

Conclusion: 内存增强架构能够有效分离通用推理能力和长尾世界知识存储，显著提升参数效率，为资源受限环境下的高性能语言模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的外部验证器、人工评估或需要单个模型多次采样的自一致性技术，而多LLM系统虽然能产生更多样化响应但表现往往不如单LLM自一致性。

Method: 使用校准的对数似然得分来隐式利用这些模型的固有知识和置信度，从多个不同LLM中选择最佳响应。

Result: 在GSM8K、MMLU（6个子集）和ARC数据集上，辩论（多轮LLM讨论）和非辩论（多LLM最佳选择）设置下分别实现了约4%、3%和5%的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下从多个LLM中选择可靠响应提供了一种原则性、新颖且计算高效的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets

Motivation: 现有RAG系统主要依赖非结构化文档，而忽略了关系数据库提供的精确、及时且可高效查询的事实信息。数据库和文档在不同查询中具有互补优势，但简单组合会引入噪声和成本而无法持续提升准确性。

Method: 提出规则驱动的路由框架：路由代理基于显式规则对候选增强路径评分并选择最合适的路径；规则制定专家代理使用QA反馈随时间优化规则以保持适应性；路径级元缓存重用语义相似查询的过往路由决策以减少延迟和成本。

Result: 在三个QA基准测试上的实验表明，该框架持续优于静态策略和学习路由基线，在保持适度计算成本的同时实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过系统规则捕获查询类型与检索路径的一致性规律，可以有效指导路由决策，在数据库和文档之间实现智能选择，平衡有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统框架，通过数据库级别的结构化领域陈述来改进LLM将自然语言查询转换为SQL的性能，使用子字符串匹配检索相关领域陈述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖不现实的、特定查询的文本提示来表达领域知识，而自然语言查询常使用领域特定词汇，需要理解这些词汇与数据库模式结构的关系。

Method: 提出系统框架，在数据库级别关联结构化领域陈述，使用子字符串匹配检索给定用户查询的相关结构化领域陈述。

Result: 在11个现实数据库模式上评估，涵盖五个开源和专有LLM，证明数据库级别的结构化领域陈述比现有特定查询文本领域陈述更实用准确，子字符串匹配检索方法比其他检索方法准确率显著更高。

Conclusion: 数据库级别的结构化领域陈述和子字符串匹配检索方法能有效提升LLM在自然语言到SQL转换任务中的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅通过文本训练的大语言模型可以通过感官提示激活潜在的视觉和听觉表征，使其与专业视觉和音频编码器的表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索纯文本训练的大语言模型是否包含隐含的多模态规律，以及能否通过感官提示激活这些潜在表征。

Method: 使用感官提示（如'看'或'听'）引导模型，让模型在生成下一个token时仿佛基于视觉或听觉证据进行预测。

Result: 轻量级的提示工程能够可靠地激活纯文本训练LLM中与模态相适应的表征。

Conclusion: 纯文本训练的LLM内部确实包含隐含的多模态结构，通过适当的感官提示可以激活这些表征，实现与专业编码器的对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Abstract: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage),
an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing,
clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patients' conditions. Its
hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured
dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM)

on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and
robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of
existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare.
  We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale
nation-wide inter-hospital IT platform, with over 55,000 content-rich user
dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were
expert-annotated for a consequent validation. The validation results show that
CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing
precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the
consultation than with a human.

*Laura Ying Schulz,Daniel Mitropolsky,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于概率上下文无关文法（PCFGs）的新框架来研究语言模型如何习得语法，通过合成语言实验揭示了Transformer的并行学习模式与人类儿童递进学习的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型的语法学习动态，目前对此知之甚少。大多数感兴趣的领域（如自然语言语法、编程语言、算术问题）都可以用PCFGs来捕捉。

Method: 使用PCFGs生成合成语言训练小型模型，精确控制语法复杂度、递归深度和子语法结构，推导训练损失和KL散度的递归公式。

Result: 发现Transformer并行减少所有子语法的损失（不同于儿童的递进学习）；子语法预训练能改善小模型的最终损失；预训练模型内部表示更符合语法子结构；模型在处理深层递归结构时存在困难。

Conclusion: 该工作开启了在PCFGs上研究Transformer学习动态的新方向，作为探测语言模型学习的通用测试平台，揭示了许多开放性问题。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

TL;DR: Cobweb框架使用层次结构组织文档检索，通过原型树实现从粗到细的检索过程，提供多粒度相关性信号和可解释的检索路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经文档检索将语料库视为扁平向量空间，忽视了语料结构且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用Cobweb框架将句子嵌入组织成原型树，通过两种推理方法进行文档排序：广义最佳优先搜索和轻量级路径求和排序器。

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上，使用BERT/T5和GPT-2表示进行测试，Cobweb在强编码器嵌入上匹配点积搜索性能，在GPT-2向量上表现更稳健。

Conclusion: Cobweb提供竞争性效果、对嵌入质量的改进鲁棒性、可扩展性以及通过层次原型的可解释检索。

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标难以有效捕捉现代LLM生成内容的关键特征，这些内容通常具有高流畅性和自然性。RAG系统评估仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 扩展RAGAS框架为基于知识图谱的评估范式，实现多跳推理和语义社区聚类，从而获得更全面的评分指标。

Result: 与RAGAS分数相比，该方法性能更优，与人工标注结果相关性更高，且对生成输出的细微语义差异更敏感。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的评估方法能更深入地理解RAG系统性能，为未来RAG系统评估研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

Motivation: 理解语音语言模型中关键组件模态适配器如何将语音编码器输出转换为语言模型可理解的表示，目前对此过程了解甚少。

Method: 通过寻找MA表示到解码器语言模型最近邻标记的方法，分析三种SLM模型的MA输出表示策略。

Result: 发现两种MA表示策略：使用Whisper编码器的模型创建英语中介语表示语义，能处理未见语言；不使用Whisper的模型用英语单词表示语音音素。

Conclusion: MA表示策略取决于语音编码器的训练目标：仅语音识别训练导致音素表示，包含翻译训练则产生语义表示。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型如何利用上下文信息对用户来说是不透明的，现有高亮解释方法缺乏对其准确性的评估框架，需要建立直接评估机制来验证这些解释方法的有效性。

Method: 引入基于已知真实上下文使用情况的受控测试案例的金标准评估框架，评估了三种现有技术和新适配的MechLight机制解释方法，涵盖四种上下文场景、四个数据集和五个语言模型。

Result: MechLight在所有上下文场景中表现最佳，但所有方法在处理长上下文时都表现不佳，并显示出位置偏差，表明在提供可靠上下文利用解释方面存在根本性挑战。

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法来解决长上下文处理和位置偏差问题，以实现大规模可靠的上下文利用解释。

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

TL;DR: 用户与LLM聊天机器人和人类客服的沟通风格存在显著差异，包括语法流畅度、礼貌程度和词汇多样性。为增强LLM对部署后沟通风格变化的适应性，数据增强策略比推理时消息重构更有效。


<details>

Motivation: 随着LLM在客户服务中的广泛应用，需要了解用户与聊天机器人和人类客服的沟通差异，以改进模型训练策略。

Method: 采用两种策略：后训练阶段的数据增强和推理时用户消息重构，比较它们在适应沟通风格变化方面的效果。

Result: 使用风格多样化数据集训练的模型显著优于仅使用原始或风格统一数据集的模型，而推理时重构策略效果较差。

Conclusion: LLM训练应考虑用户与聊天机器人沟通风格的特殊性，数据增强是提升模型适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,

young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data

further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注静态基准和单轮评估，无法捕捉真实对话中的时间动态退化特征，需要新的方法来理解LLM在多轮对话中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，使用Cox比例风险模型、加速失效时间模型和随机生存森林方法，将对话失败建模为时间到事件过程。

Result: 突发语义漂移会灾难性地增加对话失败风险，而渐进累积漂移则显著降低失败风险并支持更长的对话。AFT交互模型表现最佳，具有出色的判别和校准能力。

Conclusion: 生存分析是评估LLM鲁棒性的强大范式，为设计弹性对话代理提供了具体见解，并挑战了对话AI系统中语义一致性必要性的普遍假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Result: 通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的表现，现成LLM在复杂领域特定场景中会遇到性能瓶颈，推理能力对较小LLM提升更显著。

Conclusion: 需要领域特定的评估基准来准确理解LLM在低资源任务中的能力，推理能力是提升较小模型性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PGMEL方法，通过生成对抗网络框架解决多模态实体链接问题，生成器负责生成高质量负样本，判别器进行度量学习，使用策略梯度优化生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL方法未探索高质量负样本选择在度量学习中的关键作用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用生成对抗网络框架，生成器生成高质量负样本，判别器执行度量学习任务，使用策略梯度技术优化离散的生成过程。

Result: 在Wiki-MEL、Richpedia-MEL和WikiDiverse数据集上的实验表明，PGMEL通过选择挑战性负样本学习有意义的表示，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PGMEL方法有效解决了多模态实体链接问题，证明了高质量负样本生成在度量学习中的重要性。

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Santhosh G S,Akshay Govind S,Gokul S Krishnan,Balaraman Ravindran,Sriraam Natarajan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于对比学习编码器的评估框架和IndiCASA数据集，评估LLMs在印度多元文化背景下的偏见，发现所有模型都存在刻板印象偏见，特别是残疾相关偏见最为持久。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险应用中的部署需要严格评估嵌入偏见，特别是在印度这样文化多元的背景下，现有基于嵌入的偏见评估方法往往无法捕捉细微的刻板印象。

Method: 提出基于对比学习编码器的评估框架，通过嵌入相似性捕捉细粒度偏见；引入包含2,575条人工验证句子的IndiCASA数据集，涵盖种姓、性别、宗教、残疾和社会经济地位五个维度。

Result: 评估多个开源LLMs发现所有模型都表现出不同程度的刻板印象偏见，残疾相关偏见最为持久，宗教偏见相对较低（可能由于全球去偏见努力）。

Conclusion: 研究证明了需要更公平的模型开发，特别是在多元文化背景下评估和减轻偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我意识的强化学习方法，通过模型自我生成任务并尝试解决，使用难度预测和极限突破机制，在仅需少量额外数据的情况下显著提升LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练需要大量人工标注数据，成本高昂。本研究旨在探索如何用最少的数据通过RL提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 采用交替策略：LLM先提出任务，然后尝试解决。引入两个自我意识机制：自我难度预测（评估任务难度并优先选择有挑战但可解决的任务）和自我极限突破（识别超出能力范围的任务并主动请求外部数据）。

Result: 在9个基准测试上取得了53.8%的相对改进，仅使用不到1.2%的额外数据。

Conclusion: 自我意识RL方法有效证明了自进化智能体训练的潜力，能够在数据稀缺情况下显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

*Tien Phat Nguyen,Vu Minh Ngo,Tung Nguyen,Linh Van Ngo,Duc Anh Nguyen,Sang Dinh,Trung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XTRA是一个跨语言主题建模框架，通过表示对齐和主题对齐机制，在共享语义空间中统一词袋模型和多语言嵌入，显著提升了主题一致性、多样性和跨语言对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言主题建模方法在主题多样性方面有所改进，但难以同时保证高主题一致性和跨语言对齐一致性。

Method: XTRA框架包含两个核心组件：(1) 表示对齐：通过对比学习在共享语义空间中对齐文档-主题分布；(2) 主题对齐：将主题-词分布投影到相同空间以强制跨语言一致性。

Result: 在多语言语料库上的实验表明，XTRA在主题一致性、多样性和对齐质量方面显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: XTRA通过双对齐机制能够学习到可解释且跨语言对齐良好的主题，为跨语言主题建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

*Matej Gjurković*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SIMPA框架，通过匹配用户生成内容与验证问卷项目来实现可解释的人格评估，并构建了两个大型人格标注数据集MBTI9k和PANDORA来解决数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人格评估中两个主要挑战：大型人格标注数据集的稀缺性，以及人格心理学与自然语言处理之间的脱节，这限制了模型的有效性和可解释性。

Method: 1) 从Reddit收集构建MBTI9k和PANDORA两个数据集；2) 开发SIMPA框架，使用机器学习和语义相似度匹配用户陈述与验证问卷项目；3) 考虑人口统计变量对模型有效性的影响。

Result: 实验表明人口统计变量影响模型有效性，SIMPA框架能够提供与人类评估相当的人格评估，同时保持高可解释性和效率。PANDORA数据集包含1700万条评论，覆盖超过1万名用户。

Conclusion: SIMPA框架不仅适用于人格评估，其模型无关设计、分层线索检测和可扩展性使其适用于涉及复杂标签分类学和变量线索关联的各种研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

*Tengjun Ni,Xin Yuan,Shenghong Li,Kai Wu,Ren Ping Liu,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG框架结合问题分解和广度优先搜索推理流程，在多跳问答中实现了最先进的性能，提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成在多跳问答中面临迭代推理步骤与外部知识检索集成的挑战，需要更有效的方法来整合推理和检索过程。

Method: 构建全局索引，推理时仅将检索到的段落动态解析为知识图谱，将复杂查询分解为子问题，使用BFS遍历相关边构建显式证据链。

Result: 在MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA和HotpotQA数据集上达到最先进的精确匹配和F1分数，平均EM提升2.57%，F1提升2.13%，HotpotQA上提升最大（+4.70% EM，+3.44% F1）。

Conclusion: StepChain GraphRAG通过保留中间检索步骤的思维链增强了可解释性，未来工作应关注减少计算开销和缓解大语言模型的幻觉问题，以提升多跳问答的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

*Shinya Uryu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统验证了5个主流大语言模型在21,955个物种上的IUCN红色名录评估表现，发现模型在分类学任务上表现出色(94.9%)，但在保护推理任务上表现不佳(27.2%)，存在明显的知识-推理差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在生物多样性保护中的快速应用，需要系统评估其在物种评估任务上的可靠性，特别是对IUCN红色名录评估关键组件的表现。

Method: 对5个领先的大语言模型在21,955个物种上进行系统验证，评估四个核心IUCN红色名录评估组件：分类学、保护状态、分布和威胁。

Result: 模型在分类学分类上表现优异(94.9%)，但在保护状态评估等推理任务上表现很差(27.2%)，存在系统性偏差，偏向有魅力的脊椎动物。

Conclusion: 大语言模型是强大的信息检索工具，但在基于判断的决策中需要人类监督，建议采用混合方法，让LLMs增强专家能力，同时人类专家保留风险评估和政策的最终决定权。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个Wordle游戏的完整约束满足问题(CSP)表述，开发了CSP感知熵和概率CSP框架，在2,315个英文单词上实现了3.54次平均猜测次数和99.9%成功率，比现有方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wordle求解器依赖信息论熵最大化或基于频率的启发式方法，缺乏正式的约束处理。论文旨在通过CSP方法提供更系统的解决方案。

Method: 引入CSP感知熵（在约束传播后计算信息增益）和概率CSP框架（将贝叶斯词频先验与逻辑约束结合），并开发约束恢复机制。

Result: CSP感知熵达到3.54平均猜测次数，99.9%成功率，比前向检查快46%。在10%噪声下保持5.3个百分点的优势，概率CSP在所有噪声水平下实现100%成功率。

Conclusion: 正式的CSP处理、约束感知启发式、概率-逻辑集成、鲁棒性分析和跨词典验证建立了新的性能基准，证明基于约束满足的技术在结构化谜题求解领域优于传统方法。

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRGen是一个轻量级的测试时框架，通过在不确定点进行自我反思来增强LLM的推理能力，使用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token并训练校正向量来修正概率分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自反思机制要么对整个草稿进行修订，要么通过昂贵训练学习自校正，都是被动且低效的。需要一种在生成过程中主动进行自我反思的方法。

Method: 在token生成过程中，利用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token，为每个识别出的token训练特定的校正向量，利用已生成上下文进行自反思生成以修正token概率分布。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，SRGen显著提升模型推理能力：DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B在AIME2024上Pass@1提升12.0%，Cons@5提升13.3%。

Conclusion: SRGen作为一个即插即用方法，将反思集成到生成过程中，实现可靠的LLM推理，在有限开销下获得一致增益，并能与其他训练时和测试时技术组合使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏专门针对对话数据检索的评估标准，需要建立可靠基准来测量系统从对话数据中检索产品洞察的能力。

Method: 构建包含1.6k查询和9.1k对话的CDR基准，涵盖五个分析任务，评估了16个流行的嵌入模型性能。

Result: 最佳模型在NDCG@10上仅达到约0.51，表明对话数据检索与文档检索存在显著性能差距，识别了隐含状态识别、轮次动态和上下文引用等独特挑战。

Conclusion: CDR基准为对话数据检索提供了首个综合评估标准，揭示了该领域的技术挑战，并提供了实用的查询模板和错误分析，有助于推动该领域发展。

Abstract: We present the Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark, the first
comprehensive test set for evaluating systems that retrieve conversation data
for product insights. With 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k
conversations, our benchmark provides a reliable standard for measuring
conversational data retrieval performance. Our evaluation of 16 popular
embedding models shows that even the best models reach only around NDCG@10 of
0.51, revealing a substantial gap between document and conversational data
retrieval capabilities. Our work identifies unique challenges in conversational
data retrieval (implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, contextual
references) while providing practical query templates and detailed error
analysis across different task categories. The benchmark dataset and code are

*Jingqi Zhang,Ruibo Chen,Yingqing Yang,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang,Yan Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE是一个实用的黑盒检测框架，用于检测LLM微调中是否使用了受版权保护的数据集。它通过无失真水印和熵门控程序来增强检测能力，在各种数据集和模型上都能实现显著检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的成员推理攻击和数据集推理方法需要访问内部信号如logits，而当前的黑盒方法依赖手工制作的提示或干净的参考数据集进行校准，限制了实际应用。水印技术虽然很有前景，但现有方法会降低文本质量或任务性能。

Method: TRACE使用私钥指导对数据集进行无失真水印重写，确保文本质量和下游效用。在检测时，利用微调对水印数据的放射性效应，引入熵门控程序选择性地对高不确定性token进行评分，显著增强检测能力。

Result: 在各种数据集和模型系列中，TRACE始终实现显著检测（p<0.05），通常具有极强的统计证据。此外，它支持多数据集归属，即使在大规模非水印语料上继续预训练后仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRACE为可靠的黑盒验证受版权保护数据集使用提供了一条实用途径，解决了现有方法的局限性，同时保持文本质量和任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于查询英国NICE临床指南，该系统通过混合嵌入机制实现高精度检索，显著提高了LLM生成答案的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NICE临床指南篇幅长、数量多，在时间紧迫的医疗系统中难以有效利用的问题，通过自然语言查询为用户提供精确匹配的信息。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，包含混合嵌入机制，从300份指南中提取10,195个文本块构建数据库，使用7,901个查询进行系统评估。

Result: 检索系统表现优异：平均倒数排名0.814，首块召回率81%，前10块召回率99.1%。生成阶段RAG增强模型在忠实度方面提升64.7个百分点至99.5%，上下文精度达到满分1，显著优于医学专用LLM。

Conclusion: RAG被证明是医疗保健领域应用生成式AI的有效、可靠且可扩展的方法，能够以成本效益高的方式访问医疗指南，防止信息捏造。

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别(SER)对于改善人机交互至关重要，但由于语音中情感细微差别的复杂性，其准确性仍受限制。

Method: 通过让参与者观看情感丰富的电影片段后描述体验，记录音频片段、意图情感标签、自我评价的情感反应以及效价/唤醒度评分。

Result: 实验表明描述性语义与意图情感一致，而表达性语义与唤起的情感相关。

Conclusion: 这些发现为人机交互中的SER应用提供了信息，并为开发更具上下文感知能力的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way

TL;DR: 比较语音到文本翻译中Chain-of-Thought和Direct两种提示策略在不同数据规模下的表现，发现随着数据量增加，Direct策略改善更一致，可能成为更有效的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的语音到文本翻译模型主要采用Chain-of-Thought提示策略，但需要系统比较其与Direct策略在不同数据规模下的表现差异。

Method: 通过将ASR语料库的转录本翻译成六种欧洲语言来伪标注数据，在不同数据规模下训练基于LLM的S2TT系统，比较两种提示策略。

Result: Direct策略随着数据量增加表现改善更一致，而Chain-of-Thought策略的改进相对不稳定。

Conclusion: 随着更大规模的S2TT资源被创建，Direct策略可能成为更有效的语音到文本翻译方法。

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

Motivation: 放射学报告评估对放射科医生培训至关重要，但现有大型语言模型在专业领域应用困难，需要专门的方法来准确比较初步报告和最终报告的语义差异。

Method: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和命名实体识别，通过可调权重强调或弱化特定类型的差异，生成定量相似性评分和解释性反馈。

Result: 该方法达到67%的精确匹配准确率和93%的±1误差范围内准确率，优于单独使用LLM或NER方法。

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore方法能有效比较放射学报告差异，为放射科医生培训提供有价值的指导，代码已开源。

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

TL;DR: 本文分析了语音到文本翻译中的思维链方法，发现其实际上主要依赖转录文本而非语音信号，与级联系统行为相似，并未充分利用声学信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究思维链方法在语音到文本翻译中的实际表现，验证其是否真的能克服级联系统的错误传播和无法利用声学线索的问题。

Method: 通过归因方法分析、使用损坏转录的鲁棒性评估以及韵律感知测试来分析思维链方法的行为模式。

Result: 思维链方法主要依赖转录文本，很少利用语音信号，与级联系统行为相似。添加直接语音翻译数据或噪声转录注入可以增强鲁棒性并提高语音归因。

Conclusion: 思维链方法并未实现预期的优势，需要开发能明确整合声学信息的架构来改进语音到文本翻译。

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

Motivation: 现有自动生成学术综述的方法（LLM4Survey）输出质量达不到人类标准，且缺乏与读者需求对齐的严谨评估基准来揭示其不足。

Method: 构建SurveyBench评估框架，包括：从11,343篇arXiv论文和4,947篇高质量综述中提取典型主题；建立多维度指标层次评估大纲质量、内容质量和非文本丰富度；采用基于内容和测验的双模式评估协议。

Result: SurveyBench有效挑战了现有LLM4Survey方法，在基于内容的评估中平均比人类低21%。

Conclusion: SurveyBench填补了学术综述自动生成评估的空白，为改进LLM4Survey方法提供了严谨的基准。

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言环境下的置信度校准这一关键特性尚未得到充分探索，而可靠的置信度校准对于模型的实际部署至关重要。

Method: 对6个模型家族和100多种语言进行大规模校准研究，分析内部表示，发现最终层存在英语中心偏差，提出基于中间层的语言感知置信度集成方法LACE。

Conclusion: 英语中心对齐存在隐藏成本，通过超越最终层的方法可以构建更公平可信的多语言大模型。

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种检测AI编辑文本的方法，通过相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，并训练EditLens模型在二元和三元分类任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测完全AI生成的文本，但大量查询要求LLM编辑用户提供的文本，因此需要区分AI编辑文本与人类写作和AI生成文本。

Method: 首先使用轻量级相似度指标量化AI编辑程度，并用人类标注验证；然后利用这些相似度指标作为中间监督，训练回归模型EditLens来预测文本中的AI编辑量。

Result: 模型在二元分类任务中F1=94.7%，三元分类任务中F1=90.4%，达到最先进性能。通过Grammarly案例研究验证了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: AI编辑文本可以被检测，且AI对人类写作的修改程度也可以被检测，这对作者归属、教育和政策有重要意义。作者承诺公开模型和数据集。

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

Method: 通过维度降维、使用新的相似性度量方法，比较不同训练数据和模型配置下的相关性。

Result: 确认先前结果稳健：相关性不受维度影响，新度量方法验证了结果，相关性特定于人类语言训练的模型且依赖位置编码。

Conclusion: 研究结果强化了先前发现的稳健性，支持大语言模型与大脑状态在表示上的相似性，为这些模型的生物学合理性和可解释性提供了证据。

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

Method: 提出简单实用的LLM主题建模方法：采样数据子集、通过提示生成主题和代表性文本、使用关键词匹配进行文本分配，并通过零样本提示与NTMs进行系统比较。

Result: 通过实验系统比较了NTMs和LLMs在主题质量方面的表现，验证了LLM在主题建模任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM为基础的主题建模新范式具有潜力，能够与传统的神经主题模型竞争，为大语言模型在主题建模领域的应用提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨语言迁移方法在缺乏目标语言数据时只能依赖语言层面的特征，需要一种能够利用无标注目标语言数据来更准确排序源语言的方法。

Method: 使用预训练多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据，通过计算源语言和目标语言表示之间的相似度来排序源语言。

Result: 在词性标注任务上NDCG平均提升35.56，命名实体识别任务上提升18.14；仅使用25个无标注样本就能达到全数据92.8%的排序效果。

Conclusion: NN-Rank能够有效利用少量无标注目标语言数据生成高质量的源语言排序，在跨语言迁移任务中表现优异且实用性强。

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

TL;DR: FocusAgent使用轻量级LLM检索器从可访问性树中提取最相关的内容行，通过修剪噪声和无关内容来提高Web代理的效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Web代理需要处理过长的网页内容，这会超出上下文限制、增加计算成本，并暴露于提示注入等安全风险。现有的修剪策略要么丢弃相关内容，要么保留无关上下文，导致动作预测不理想。

Method: 提出FocusAgent方法，利用轻量级LLM检索器从可访问性树观察中提取与任务目标最相关的行，通过修剪噪声和无关内容来实现高效推理。

Result: 在WorkArena和WebArena基准测试中，FocusAgent与强基线性能相当，同时将观察大小减少超过50%。其变体显著降低了提示注入攻击的成功率，包括横幅和弹窗攻击，同时在无攻击环境下保持任务成功性能。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的针对性检索是构建高效、有效且安全的Web代理的实用且稳健策略。

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

TL;DR: 提出Cache-to-Cache (C2C)范式，通过直接语义通信替代文本通信，在多LLM系统中实现更高质量和更快的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM系统通过文本通信会丢失丰富的语义信息并产生逐token生成的延迟，限制了系统性能。

Method: 使用神经网络投影和融合源模型与目标模型的KV-cache，实现直接语义传输，并通过可学习门控机制选择受益于缓存通信的目标层。

Result: C2C比单个模型平均准确率提高8.5-10.5%，比文本通信范式性能提升约3.0-5.0%，同时延迟平均加速2.0倍。

Conclusion: KV-cache作为模型间通信媒介是有效的，C2C通过直接语义通信显著提升了多LLM系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理链的延长，关键的中间步骤和原始提示会被淹没在上下文中，导致注意力不足和错误。需要一种方法来维持LLM在复杂推理任务中的注意力焦点。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划，自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，使模型在整个生成过程中保持专注。

Result: 在六个基准测试中优于最先进的提示方法，显著缩小了"非推理"模型与专门推理模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: Self-Anchor有潜力使大多数LLM无需重新训练即可处理复杂推理任务，提供了一种轻量级的替代微调和强化学习的方法。

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

Motivation: 当前强化学习奖励模型和AI评估指标两个研究领域相对分离，导致术语冗余和问题重复出现，阻碍了相关技术的发展。

Conclusion: 奖励模型和评估指标研究领域的紧密合作能够共同克服现有挑战，提升各自的技术水平和发展效率。

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极端值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法，使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，发现SMOTE策略在极端值预测中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战，需要有效的数据增强方法来提升预测性能。

Method: 使用GANs和SMOTE进行数据增强，结合Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步极端值预测，并提出了基于相关性函数的极端值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中都表现出更好的适应性，Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据中表现优异，而BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是SMOTE方法能有效提升极端值预测性能，不同深度学习模型在不同类型数据中各有优势，需要根据数据特性选择合适的模型。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在医学领域中无法处理时间序列数据的局限性，将大量临床信息转化为可操作的洞察和数字健康应用。

Method: 开发了两种架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习的时间序列标记与文本标记连接；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力将时间序列与文本集成。在三个数据集（HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT、ECG-QA-CoT）上进行基准测试。

Result: OpenTSLM模型在所有任务上都优于基线，在睡眠分期达到69.9 F1，在HAR达到65.4 F1，而仅文本微调模型分别为9.05和52.2。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超过了GPT-4o（15.47和2.95）。Flamingo版本在长序列上表现更好且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，在医疗时间序列推理任务上表现出色，显式建模方法在性能和内存效率上优于隐式方法。所有代码、数据集和模型都已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合多种信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），使用单一流动性参数控制集中度，在固定计算预算下实现多信号数据筛选的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法需要手动组合多种效用信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），权重设置随意且缺乏理论依据，难以在固定计算预算下实现有效的数据筛选。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，单一流动性参数控制集中度，通过主题归一化稳定校准。采用价格-每令牌规则处理令牌预算，轻量级多样性头提高覆盖率。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集（60k令牌预算）上，市场方法在保持与强基线相当性能的同时，减少了种子方差，选择开销小于0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews数据集（保留5-25%数据）上，市场方法在保持竞争力的准确率的同时，提高了平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明的聚合强度调节机制。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段架构解决雷达体积场到地面降水观测的转换问题，显著提升了降雨场重建的精度和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉尖锐过渡和局部极端值，这对于洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析至关重要。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息驱动的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器进行空间对齐，将中尺度雷达结构投影到局部地面降雨；地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降、融化和蒸发的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法持续改进，MAE降低超过13.31%，并显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理基础的结构先验，成功解决了降雨场重建中的关键挑战，为高精度降雨监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Advisor Models框架，通过轻量级参数化策略在上下文中间黑盒模型发出自然语言引导指令，实现动态优化而非静态提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，定制仅限于提示。静态提示优化产生单一固定提示，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略，在输入和模型之间插入第二个小模型，基于环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在涉及推理和个性化的多个领域，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能发现环境动态并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，是实现个性化和环境自适应AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

### [141] [Assessing the Potential for Catastrophic Failure in Dynamic Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02457)
*Logan Frank,Paul Ardis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

TL;DR: SAGE是一种流式数据子集选择方法，通过维护梯度几何的紧凑Frequent Directions草图，优先选择与共识方向对齐的示例，实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练现代神经网络在大数据集上计算和能耗密集，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图在O(ℓD)内存中维护梯度几何，通过两遍、GPU友好的流程消除N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用小子集预算训练，同时保持与全数据训练和最新子集选择基线相当的准确性，减少端到端计算和峰值内存。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，补充了剪枝和模型压缩，用于高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

*Jie Li,Andrew McCarthy,Zhizhuo Zhang,Stephen Young*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，通过选择预测不确定性最低的TabPFN模型进行集成，在siRNA敲低效能预测任务中取得了优于传统方法和单一模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子效能预测中很有前景，但其性能对提供的上下文高度敏感。如何在没有真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，研究模型预测的inter-quantile range(IQR)与真实预测误差的关系，选择平均IQR最低的模型进行集成。

Result: TabPFN模型在siRNA敲低效能预测任务中超越了专门的先进预测器；模型预测的IQR与真实预测误差呈负相关；基于最低平均IQR选择的集成模型性能优于朴素集成或使用所有数据训练的单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是优化生物分子效能预测的强大、无需标签的启发式方法。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Litespark是一个新颖的预训练框架，通过优化transformer注意力层和MLP层，显著提升训练效率，在3B和30B参数Llama模型上实现2-6倍训练吞吐量提升和55%-83%能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练面临训练时间长、能耗巨大的挑战，现代模型需要数月计算时间和吉瓦时级别的电力消耗。

Method: 结合架构改进和算法增强，针对transformer注意力层和MLP层进行优化，最大化模型FLOPs利用率，同时保持与标准transformer实现的兼容性。

Result: 在3B和30B参数Llama模型上使用SlimPajama-627B数据集进行基准测试，显示训练吞吐量提升2-6倍，能耗降低55%-83%。

Conclusion: 这些优化具有模型和硬件无关性，可广泛应用于各种transformer架构，并扩展到监督微调和直接偏好优化等后训练阶段。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

*Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF)方法，通过对比学习从高维观测中提取可独立控制的潜在变量，解决了传统方法需要先验因子表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么假设已知因子化表示（不适用于高维观测），要么无法利用因子化结构（如深度强化学习）。需要一种能从高维输入中自动发现可控因子的方法。

Method: ACF利用动作稀疏性：每个动作通常只影响状态变量的子集，而其余变量在环境动态下演化。通过对比学习训练，揭示可独立控制的潜在变量。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试中，ACF直接从像素观测中恢复了真实的可控因子，始终优于基线解纠缠算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了高维观测下的表示问题，能够自动发现可控因子结构，为样本高效的强化学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，通过DRL利用历史数据快速控制多参数系统，同时ES确保对时变系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL能够从大数据集中学习以快速控制多参数系统，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会急剧下降；有界ES能处理时变系统但收敛速度慢且易陷入局部最小值。

Method: 开发DRL和有界ES的混合控制器，DRL负责快速控制多参数系统到期望设定点，有界ES确保对时变系统的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过单独使用DRL或ES，在数值研究和粒子加速器自动调谐应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: DRL和有界ES的结合产生协同效应，既能快速控制多参数系统，又能保证对时变系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调(SFT)与逆强化学习的等价性，证明SFT不仅学习策略，还学习了一个隐式的密集token级奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上SFT被视为简单的模仿学习过程，本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立了SFT与逆Q学习的等价性，提出了基线相对奖励函数来从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发了Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用忆阻设备进行深度神经网络计算，但实际中许多有前景的忆阻设备（如ReRAM）由于制造限制只能提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 采用残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习，补偿低精度权重更新产生的残差误差。

Result: 理论分析显示最优性差距随瓦片数量增加而缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限状态设备上实现了有效的片上训练，同时成本分析确认只产生适度的硬件开销。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐目标图的谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入和目标图嵌入连续黎曼流形，定义嵌入间的测地线流，并沿这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，在可扩展性和训练效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Motivation: 解决神经网络模型与大脑响应比较缺乏共识方法的问题，建立既能准确预测神经活动又能识别神经机制的比较框架。

Method: 使用IATC（跨动物变换类）方法，识别将模型响应与大脑数据双向映射所需的最严格函数集，在模拟网络、小鼠和人类被试中验证。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的细节特征（如非线性激活函数），准确预测神经活动，同时高特异性识别机制，区分不同脑区响应模式。

Conclusion: IATC证明模型预测性与机制识别不存在固有权衡，为深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-大脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够从纵向可穿戴数据中同时进行时序聚类和结果预测的模型，以识别行为亚型并提供临床可解释的风险解释。

Method: 使用注意力机制的GRU自编码器，联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习紧凑潜在表示、通过二元分类头预测抑郁率、基于GMM的软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者的睡眠数据上，聚类质量（轮廓分数0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74）均优于基线模型；在332名参与者的跨年队列验证中保持稳定（轮廓分数0.63，AUC 0.61）。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE能够有效识别行为亚型并提供临床可解释的风险解释，通过可视化时间注意力机制揭示了与睡眠规律变化相关的关键时间窗口。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Conclusion: 高阶节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN方法在理论和实验上都证明了其有效性，为GNN表达能力研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Method: 提出MINTO方法，使用目标网络和在线网络的最小值估计来计算目标值，通过这种简单有效的修改来减轻使用在线网络进行自举时可能出现的过高估计偏差。

Result: 在涵盖在线和离线强化学习、离散和连续动作空间的多样化基准测试中，MINTO始终提升性能，证明了其广泛的适用性和有效性。

Conclusion: MINTO方法能够实现更快更稳定的价值函数学习，可以无缝集成到各种基于价值和演员-评论家算法中，且计算成本可忽略不计。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and

featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效加速了AdaLoRA的收敛，为参数高效微调提供了一种高效的解决方案，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Conclusion: 这是首个严格优化车载传感平台的研究，提出了专门设计的巡检车辆概念。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要构建能够处理辅导细微差别的模型：识别学生核心需求、自适应、提供个性化指导和准确性。

Method: 创建TutorBench数据集，包含高中和AP课程水平的1,490个样本，涵盖三个辅导任务，使用样本特定评分标准和LLM-judge进行自动评估。

Result: 评估了16个前沿LLMs，结果显示所有模型得分均不超过56%，在辅导技能相关标准上的通过率低于60%。Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他用例中落后。

Conclusion: 当前前沿LLMs在展示完整的辅导技能方面存在不足，TutorBench为开发下一代AI辅导系统提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

Method: 通过分析置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等）在训练过程中诱导的双Lipschitz映射，研究神经元分布的拓扑约束和简化机制。

Result: 发现学习率临界点η*的存在：低于η*时拓扑结构完全保持，高于η*时允许拓扑简化。结合边缘稳定性现象，提出训练分为两个阶段：平滑优化阶段和拓扑简化阶段。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于具体架构或损失函数，为深度学习研究提供了通用的拓扑方法，揭示了学习率在训练动态中的关键作用。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GRAFT框架，将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT，并证明其隐式执行PPO。进一步提出P-GRAFT在中间噪声水平塑造分布，以及无奖励的逆噪声校正方法，在多个生成任务上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来调整这些分布。传统策略梯度方法（如PPO）在扩散模型中难以计算边际似然，需要替代方案。

Method: 1. 统一RAFT变体为GRAFT框架，证明其隐式执行PPO；2. 提出P-GRAFT在中间噪声水平进行分布塑造；3. 基于偏差-方差权衡分析，提出无奖励的逆噪声校正方法。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上验证。Stable Diffusion 2在T2I基准上VQAScore优于策略梯度方法，相对基础模型提升8.81%。无条件图像生成中，逆噪声校正在更低FLOPs下改善了FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架有效解决了扩散模型分布塑造问题，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声水平优化提升了微调效果，逆噪声校正为无奖励模型改进提供了新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

TL;DR: 提出了RAMAC框架，将表达性生成actor与分布critic结合，在离线强化学习中实现风险敏感学习，在保持高回报的同时降低尾部风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域中，离线强化学习需要在不收集在线数据的情况下提供高回报策略，同时避免灾难性的尾部风险。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置。

Method: RAMAC框架耦合表达性生成actor（如扩散和流匹配模型）与分布critic，通过生成路径区分组合目标（分布风险和BC损失），实现复杂多模态场景中的风险敏感学习。

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务中，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上取得一致增益。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了风险规避离线强化学习中表达性与安全性之间的权衡问题，为安全关键应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

this evolution has also introduced complex cybersecurity challenges due to the
heterogeneous, resource constrained, and distributed nature of these
environments. To address these challenges, this research presents CST AFNet, a

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction,
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal

to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was
trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and
realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning
15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial
testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack
types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover,
this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision,
recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST
AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming
traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a
powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex
IoT and IIoT environments, paving the way for more secure, intelligent, and
adaptive cyber physical systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差异感知来解决现有CAGC方法在边级嵌入增强和对比样本处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖节点级嵌入增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及节点级和边级嵌入增强在不同粒度上的交互作用，同时对所有对比样本对同等对待，限制了方法的判别能力。

Method: RAGC包含混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差异感知两个模块。HCA同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；CSADA利用高置信度伪标签信息自适应识别对比样本对，并通过权重调制函数差异化处理。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，RAGC相比几种最先进的CAGC方法具有更好的效果。

Conclusion: HCA和CSADA模块在良性循环中相互促进，增强了表示学习的判别能力，提出的RAGC方法在属性图聚类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新型LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理来提升文本流式生成性能，在保持高吞吐量的同时显著降低首令牌延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统由于非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理，导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，无法满足实时流式交互对响应性和稳定生成的要求。

Method: 采用动态优先级调度（基于令牌缓冲区占用率和消费速率），主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，并通过I/O与计算重叠来最小化抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B上的实验表明，TokenFlow有效吞吐量提升高达82.5%，P99 TTFT降低高达80.2%，且不降低整体令牌吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理机制，显著提升了LLM流式服务的性能，为实时交互应用提供了更好的用户体验。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Conclusion: 特定架构能够通过多样化的学习规则支持稳健学习，为神经网络中基于梯度学习的规范性理论提供了重要补充。

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components

### [177] [Optimal Rates for Generalization of Gradient Descent for Deep ReLU Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02779)
*Yuanfan Li,Yunwen Lei,Zheng-Chu Guo,Yiming Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了深度ReLU网络在梯度下降训练下能够达到接近最优的泛化率，仅与网络深度呈多项式依赖关系，而非指数依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么只能获得次优的O(1/√n)泛化率，要么只适用于平滑激活函数且对网络深度L呈指数依赖。本文旨在为深度ReLU网络建立最优泛化率。

Method: 通过精心平衡优化误差和泛化误差，在数据满足NTK可分性假设下，使用梯度下降训练深度ReLU网络，并提出了控制激活模式的新技术。

Result: 证明了过风险率为Õ(L⁴(1+γL²)/(nγ²))，这与最优SVM型率Õ(1/(nγ²))仅相差深度相关因子。

Conclusion: 深度ReLU网络在梯度下降训练下能够达到接近最优的泛化性能，关键技术创新是对参考模型附近激活模式的精确控制。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

*Théo Dupuy,Binbin Xu,Stéphane Perrey,Jacky Montmain,Abdelhak Imoussaten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的在线共形预测方法，通过在阈值更新步骤中使用更广泛的函数来量化预测区间的相关性，而不是简单的二元评估，从而产生更窄的预测区间同时保持覆盖有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线共形预测方法在阈值更新时只关注预测区间的有效性（真实值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面来改进预测性能。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中，用更广泛的函数类替代二元评估（内部/外部），这些函数使用真实值来量化预测区间的相关性，有助于防止阈值突变，可能产生更窄的预测区间。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，这些函数相比现有的OCP方法可以产生更紧的区间，同时保持覆盖有效性。

Conclusion: 通过量化预测区间相关性的函数来增强阈值更新步骤，能够有效改善在线共形预测的性能，产生更窄的预测区间而不牺牲覆盖有效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CLEAR方法，首次对transformer架构核心组件进行细粒度推理能耗分析，发现注意力模块单位FLOP能耗显著更高，表明FLOP计数无法准确反映组件级真实能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理在全球范围内持续进行，已成为AI能耗的主要来源，但现有研究缺乏细粒度测量方法，仅报告粗粒度的模型级指标，将能效视为次要目标而非主要目标。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法，通过重复采样解决微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗传感器监测之间的时间不匹配问题，评估了涵盖4种架构类型的15个模型。

Result: 组件级能耗方差保持在9.5%以下，捕获了模型总能耗90%以上的组件能耗。注意力模块单位FLOP能耗显著更高，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例。

Conclusion: 建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能transformer模型提供了初步见解，FLOPs无法准确捕捉组件级真实能耗成本。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

*Sung Ho Jo,Seonghwi Kim,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层Group DRO方法，解决传统方法对组内分布偏移的脆弱性，特别是在样本有限的少数群体中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到伪相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移仍很脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出了Group DRO的分层扩展，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，在多层次上提供对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 在新设计的模拟现实少数群体分布偏移的基准测试中，该方法表现出强大的鲁棒性，而现有鲁棒学习方法在这些条件下持续失败。在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性非常重要。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等价于随机i.i.d.输入，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。

Method: 提出了一个通用模板来适配随机学习算法到随机顺序模型，而不显著影响其遗憾保证。

Result: 恢复了延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机等问题的改进遗憾界，并证明在随机顺序模型中可学习性由VC维而非Littlestone维刻画。

Conclusion: 该模板成功将随机学习算法扩展到随机顺序模型，提供了与一般对抗模型的进一步分离。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

TL;DR: FlexiQ是一种自适应混合精度量化方案，通过选择性应用低比特计算到小值范围的特征通道，并实时调整低比特通道比例，有效管理推理工作负载波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络加速器（如NPU和GPU）成本高且难以扩展资源来处理实时工作负载波动，需要一种能够适应工作负载变化的量化方法。

Method: FlexiQ选择性对值范围小的特征通道应用低比特计算，采用高效的比特降低方法最小化量化误差，同时实时调整低比特通道比例。

Result: 在11个卷积和基于transformer的视觉模型上评估，FlexiQ在4位模型上平均精度提高6.6%，优于四种最先进的量化技术。50%4位模型仅损失0.6%精度，达到100%4位模型相对于8位模型40%的加速效果。

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理推理工作负载波动。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种在训练过程中对状态空间模型进行降维的方法，利用Hankel奇异值分析识别并保留高影响力维度，从而在保持表达能力的同时显著加速优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时面临表达性与计算负担的平衡问题，核心挑战是在最大化表达能力的同时限制状态维度的计算成本。

Method: 基于控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别并保留高能量状态维度，对原始系统进行平衡截断，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明，训练过程中的降维显著加速了优化过程，压缩后的模型保留了任务关键结构，而直接训练较小维度的模型会丢失这些结构。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中收缩的SSM能够在保持更高性能的同时实现计算效率。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Motivation: 重新审视VAR模型，将其形式化为迭代精炼框架，解释其高效性和保真度的设计选择，并扩展应用到图生成和天气预报等任务。

Method: 将VAR分解为确定性前向过程构建潜在金字塔和学习的后向过程进行粗到细重建，分析三个关键设计选择：学习潜在空间精炼、离散分类预测、按空间频率划分任务。

Result: 通过控制实验量化各因素对保真度和速度的贡献，框架可扩展到置换不变图生成和概率性天气预报，同时保持少步、尺度并行生成。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为VAR提供了实用接口，可利用扩散生态系统的工具，同时保持高效生成特性，统一了自回归和扩散模型视角。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习和梯度提升模型在预测个性化健康结果时牺牲了可解释性，且未能充分处理个体间差异问题。

Method: 使用普通最小二乘回归结合个体特异性交互项，通过迭代后向特征消除构建稀疏模型，并采用回归-阈值方法优化序数目标的F1分数，通过置信度门控选择性集成LightGBM输出。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集（10个受试者约450个日观测）上，SASL-LightGBM混合框架与复杂黑盒方法性能相当，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了与黑盒方法相当的预测性能，为临床实践提供了清晰可行的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动模型缺乏知识引导，导致长期健康预测不可靠，需要克服电池退化行为的复杂性（非线性、噪声、容量再生等）带来的挑战。

Method: 首先进行信号分解得到不同频段的电池信号，然后开发双流深度学习架构：一个流捕获长期低频退化趋势，另一个流建模高频短期动态。使用粒子滤波器优化知识模型参数，确保物理一致性和可靠性。

Result: 在两个主流数据集上，Karma相比最先进算法分别实现了50.6%和32.6%的平均误差降低，表现出优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Karma模型通过结合知识引导和频率自适应学习，为电池健康预测提供了更安全可靠的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Motivation: 传统强化学习需要真实奖励信号，测试时强化学习虽然使用多数投票奖励但计算成本高，需要寻找更轻量级的替代方案

Method: RoiRL方法采用离线迭代强化学习，优化加权对数似然目标，无需维护参考模型，实现稳定训练

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现更优

Conclusion: RoiRL为无标签的LLM自我改进提供了可扩展的路径，显著降低了计算和内存需求

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，解决了传统水印方法在非自回归模型上失效的问题，通过预测性水印、双向水印和预测-双向水印三种策略实现高检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型提供比自回归模型更快的生成速度且质量相当，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效。传统水印基于因果设计，而dLLMs可以任意顺序生成token，破坏了这种设计。

Method: DMark引入三种互补策略：预测性水印（在缺乏实际上下文时使用模型预测的token）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（结合两种方法最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLMs上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，同时保持文本质量，而现有方法的简单适应只能达到49.6-71.2%。DMark还对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，有效的非自回归语言模型水印是可行的，DMark为扩散大语言模型提供了可靠的水印解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

TL;DR: FeDABoost是一个新的联邦学习框架，通过动态提升机制和自适应梯度聚合策略，在非IID设置下提高联邦学习的性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非独立同分布(non-IID)的联邦学习环境中，传统方法如FedAvg存在性能下降和公平性问题，需要改进模型聚合和提升表现不佳客户端的训练效果。

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost(SAMME)算法的权重机制，提出自适应梯度聚合策略，为错误率低的客户端分配更高权重；同时动态调整焦点损失的聚焦参数来提升表现不佳客户端的训练。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto，在保持竞争力的性能同时显著提高了公平性。

Conclusion: FeDABoost通过创新的聚合和提升机制，有效解决了非IID联邦学习中的性能和公平性问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗时间序列分析面临数据稀疏、噪声和变长记录的挑战，需要既能处理变长信号又能提供解释性的方法。

Method: 扩展随机稀疏采样框架，通过通道内相似性加权窗口预测，在概率空间聚合结果，生成凸序列级分数和明确证据轨迹。

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上评估，方法实现了竞争性的分类性能，并为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在临床变长时间序列分类中实现可靠和可解释分类的潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Conclusion: 本文成功地将风险度量理论扩展到持续强化学习设置，提出的遍历风险度量为解决风险感知持续学习问题提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实部署场景中，当标记测试数据不可用时，评估模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力至关重要。

Method: 利用模型预测的两个内在属性——置信度（反映预测确定性）和分散度（捕获预测类别的多样性），构建置信度基、分散度基和混合度量指标，并在多种模型架构、数据集和分布偏移类型下进行系统基准测试。

Conclusion: 这些发现为部署场景中的无监督模型评估提供了实用且可推广的基础。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法能有效利用高频数据提升低频午报数据的轴功率预测精度，在不同类型船舶上均有显著改进。

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Result: 在合成基准测试、真实世界神经行为数据和MuJoCo控制任务上的实验表明，该方法恢复了表达性奖励表示并实现了最先进的模仿性能

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够捕获专家行为的丰富结构

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Motivation: 条件扩散模型的训练通常依赖包含不精确条件信息的大规模数据集，这会导致条件不匹配和生成质量下降。

Method: 基于似然最大化推导框架，将目标分解为生成组件（建模不精确标签分布）和分类组件（使用扩散分类器推断类后验概率），并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究不精确监督问题的框架，在各种任务中都能有效处理不精确标签并提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Conclusion: CHORD通过设备-云协作实现了动态模型适应和加速推理，无需反向传播，显著减少了通信开销（每通道仅需2比特而非32比特权重）。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC
and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC)
outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform
game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide
clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

Result: UD3RL在解质量和运行时间上优于传统方法，在不同问题规模、空间分布和半径范围上表现出强大的泛化能力，对动态环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL框架有效解决了接近旅行商问题，通过分离决策任务和增强空间推理，实现了优于传统方法的性能和良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Motivation: 图神经网络在组合优化问题上表现不如传统优化方法，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决图对齐这一NP难问题，提升GNN在此类问题上的性能。

Method: 采用链式训练过程，每个GNN学习迭代优化前一个网络生成的相似度矩阵；使用节点对架构而非单节点架构，以捕捉标准消息传递网络无法表示的全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，链式GNN比现有方法准确率提高3倍以上，能独特解决常规图对齐问题（其他方法均失败）；与传统优化方法结合后，在图对齐基准测试中显著优于最先进求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法成功克服了GNN在组合优化问题上的局限性，为图对齐问题提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于分数蒸馏(SiD)的蛋白质骨架生成方法，显著减少了扩散模型的采样步骤，实现了20倍以上的速度提升，同时保持了与原始模型相当的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在蛋白质骨架生成中采样步骤过多、计算成本高的问题，使其能够应用于大规模蛋白质发现场景。

Method: 采用分数身份蒸馏(SiD)技术训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制策略。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了超过20倍的采样速度提升，同时在可设计性、多样性和新颖性方面与Proteina教师模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际的蛋白质工程应用。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于图神经网络的自适应节点特征选择方法，通过在训练过程中识别并移除不必要的特征来提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统特征重要性度量方法可能不适用。需要一种能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法，用于解释决策、降低维度，甚至通过消除无用变量来提高性能。

Method: 基于干预的方法，在训练过程中通过置换特征值后验证性能的变化来确定相关特征。该方法与模型和任务无关，能够跟踪特征重要性随特征逐步剔除的演变过程。

Result: 经验结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性，以及对更具挑战性的图学习设置的适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应节点特征选择方法能够有效识别和移除不必要的特征，提高图神经网络的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征来识别重要层，用于在边缘设备上进行高效的模型重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应用户特定的运行时数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。现有的层选择方法需要标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: AdaBet通过Betti数分析激活空间的拓扑特征来对层进行重要性排序，仅使用前向传播，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上的评估显示，AdaBet相比基于梯度的基线方法平均分类准确率提升5%，平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种无需梯度的高效层选择方法，适用于资源受限的边缘设备上的模型重训练。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Conclusion: 该框架为铁路运营商提供了强大且计算高效的工具，可优化调度策略，显著改善服务一致性和乘客满意度。

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Conclusion: 投资组合感知的目标和几何感知的归纳偏置对于机器学习系统中的风险感知资本配置至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Motivation: 现有测试时算法结合语言模型生成能力和过程验证器，但验证器学习成本高且微小错误会导致生成过程中的灾难性失败。需要更先进的解码策略来改善这一问题。

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，有效提高了对验证器错误的鲁棒性，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Motivation: 通过高码率量化理论的视角，深入理解MoE模型在回归任务中的表现，特别是当专家数量足够大时的近似误差特性。

Method: 基于输入空间分割的MoE模型，每个区域使用单参数专家作为常数预测器，假设专家数量足够大使得输入空间区域很小，分析一维和多维输入的近似误差。

Result: 在一维输入情况下推导了测试误差及其最小化分割，在多维情况下给出了测试误差上界，并分析了专家参数学习时的统计学习特性。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实证研究表明，MoE学习中的近似误差与估计误差之间的权衡取决于专家数量，为MoE模型设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Conclusion: 通过关注校准误差的主动学习方法能有效提升深度神经网络在主动学习中的性能，降低校准和泛化误差。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Motivation: 学习率预热已成为深度学习的普遍启发式方法，但其理论基础仍不清楚。本文旨在从原理上解释为什么预热能改善训练效果。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑性条件，该条件将局部曲率限制为损失次优性的线性函数。在MSE和交叉熵损失下验证该条件成立，并分析预热策略下的梯度下降收敛性。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，在广义平滑性条件下，预热策略比固定步长能实现更快的收敛，建立了上下界复杂度分析。

Conclusion: 学习率预热通过利用损失函数的局部曲率特性，在理论上确实能加速训练收敛，这一结论在语言和视觉模型的实验中得到了验证。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Motivation: 联邦学习在分布式设备上实现协作模型训练的同时保护数据隐私，但在资源受限的边缘节点部署面临内存、能量和通信带宽限制的挑战。传统的同步和异步联邦学习方法在异构大规模网络中还存在滞后节点导致的延迟和收敛缓慢问题。

Result: 在包含多达500个客户端和90%滞后节点的多样化模型和数据分布实验中，FTTE相比同步联邦学习（如FedAVG）实现了81%更快的收敛速度、80%更低的设备内存使用和69%的通信负载减少，同时在挑战性场景下达到与半异步方法（如FedBuff）相当或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构且主要为资源受限边缘设备的实际可扩展联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 研究叠加假设与对齐度量之间的相互作用，验证不同叠加排列是否会干扰预测映射度量，从而产生比预期更低的表示对齐度。

Method: 开发了严格排列度量依赖叠加排列的理论，通过训练稀疏自编码器在玩具模型中解耦叠加，测试DNN→DNN和DNN→大脑线性回归对齐。

Result: 当用稀疏过完备潜在代码替换基础神经元时，对齐分数通常会增加；在视觉领域的DNN→DNN和DNN→大脑线性回归对齐中也发现类似增长。

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经代码间真实表示对齐是必要的。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

Motivation: 准确估计主观疲劳程度（RPE）可以通过个性化反馈和预防损伤来增强抗阻训练效果。

Method: 收集了69组超过1000次重复的自定义数据集，使用可穿戴惯性传感器和肌电图传感器，提取统计特征训练机器学习模型。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，完全匹配准确率为41.4%，±1 RPE误差范围内准确率为85.9%。离心重复时间是最强的RPE预测因子。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并指出了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

*Qiwei Di,Kaixuan Ji,Xuheng Li,Heyang Zhao,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM推理策略Best-of-Majority (BoM)，结合了多数投票和Best-of-N的优势，在Pass@k设置下实现最小化最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理策略（多数投票和Best-of-N）在困难任务中表现不佳，Pass@k评估设置需要更有效的推理策略。

Method: BoM策略首先将候选限制在N个样本中出现频率高的响应中，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt + √(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配的下界，证明算法是最小化最优的。实验结果显示BoM在数学问题上优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM是一种最优的LLM推理策略，其性能不会随N增加而下降，在Pass@k设置下显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分可观测性是强化学习中的主要挑战，需要学习复杂的历史依赖策略。特权专家蒸馏利用训练时的潜在状态信息来学习最优策略，但存在已知的失败模式，需要系统研究其与标准RL方法的权衡。

Method: 通过理论模型（扰动块MDP）和模拟运动任务的受控实验，对比特权专家蒸馏和标准RL方法，分析近似可解码性与信念收缩的对比。

Result: 实验表明权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性，且最优潜在策略并非总是最佳蒸馏对象。理论模型预测与实验结果一致。

Conclusion: 提出了有效利用特权信息的新指导原则，有望提升部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法来解决RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，通过保护有价值的低概率推理标记来维持有效探索，在数学推理基准上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中存在探索瓶颈，当策略熵崩溃时性能会停滞。现有方法通常通过保持高策略熵来解决，但缺乏对有意义探索机制的理解，无选择性地关注熵可能会放大不相关标记并破坏训练稳定性。

Method: 提出了低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)，核心机制是将策略正则化到一个启发式代理分布。该代理分布通过过滤掉假定为噪声的标记，并在剩余候选项上重新归一化分布来构建，从而放大推理火花的概率。

Result: Lp-Reg能够在约1000步内实现稳定的在线策略训练，而基线熵控制方法在此阶段会崩溃。在五个数学基准测试中取得了60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提高了2.66%。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护有价值的低概率推理标记来维持有效探索，解决了RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，实现了更稳定和有效的训练过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Motivation: 传统确定性方法依赖全局信息和空间网格，机器学习方法需要导数依赖和冗长训练。需要开发一种既避免这些缺点，又能高效处理超高维PDE的局部化计算方法。

Method: 基于四个关键组件：(1) FBSDE的马丁格尔公式；(2) 局部线性回归的小规模随机粒子方法；(3) 用于计算∇u的加权最小二乘系统的解耦策略；(4) 求解u中单变量非线性系统的牛顿迭代。

Conclusion: 该方法基于原则性设计，不仅扩展了超高维PDE的实际可解性边界，而且保持了严格的误差控制和易于实现的特点。

Abstract: We develop a mesh-free, derivative-free, matrix-free, and highly parallel
localized stochastic method for high-dimensional semilinear parabolic PDEs. The
efficiency of the proposed method is built upon four essential components: (i)
a martingale formulation of the forward backward stochastic differential
equation (FBSDE); (ii) a small scale stochastic particle method for local
linear regression (LLR); (iii) a decoupling strategy with a matrix-free solver
for the weighted least-squares system used to compute $\nabla u$; (iv) a Newton
iteration for solving the univariate nonlinear system in $u$. Unlike
traditional deterministic methods that rely on global information, this
localized computational scheme not only provides explicit pointwise evaluations
of $u$ and $\nabla u$ but, more importantly, is naturally suited for
parallelization across particles. In addition, the algorithm avoids the need
for spatial meshes and global basis functions required by classical
deterministic approaches, as well as the derivative-dependent and lengthy
training procedures often encountered in machine learning. More importantly, we
rigorously analyze the error bound of the proposed scheme, which is fully
explicit in both the particle number $M$ and the time step size $\Delta t$.
Numerical results conducted for problem dimensions ranging from $d=100$ to
$d=10000$ consistently verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
method. Remarkably, all computations are carried out efficiently on a standard
personal computer, without requiring any specialized hardware. These results
confirm that the proposed method is built upon a principled design that not
only extends the practical solvability frontier of ultra-high-dimensional PDEs
but also maintains rigorous error control and ease of implementation.

Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in positivity-preserving approximations of
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-Lipschitz coefficients,
arising from computational finance and possessing positive solutions. By
leveraging a Lamperti transformation, we develop a novel, explicit, and
unconditionally positivity-preserving numerical scheme for the considered
financial SDEs. More precisely, an implicit term $c_{-1}Y_{n+1}^{-1}$ is
incorporated in the scheme to guarantee unconditional positivity preservation,
and a corrective operator is introduced in the remaining explicit terms to
address the challenges posed by non-Lipschitz (possibly singular) coefficients
of the transformed SDEs. By finding a unique positive root of a quadratic
equation, the proposed scheme can be explicitly solved and is shown to be
strongly convergent with order $1$, when used to numerically solve several
well-known financial models such as the CIR process, the Heston-3/2 volatility
model, the CEV process and the A\"it-Sahalia model. Numerical experiments
validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Nonlinear eigenvalue problems with eigenvector nonlinearities (NEPv) are
algebraic eigenvalue problems whose matrix depends on the eigenvector.
Applications range from computational quantum mechanics to machine learning.
Due to its nonlinear behavior, existing methods almost exclusively rely on
fixed-point iterations, the global convergence properties of which are only
understood in specific cases. Recently, a certain class of NEPv with linear
rational eigenvector nonlinearities has been linearized, i.e., the spectrum of
the linear eigenvalue problem contains the eigenvalues of the NEPv. This linear
problem is solved using structure exploiting algorithms to improve both
convergence and reliability. We propose a linearization for a different class
of NEPv with quadratic rational nonlinearities, inspired by the discretized
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The eigenvalues of this NEPv form a subset of the
spectrum of a linear multiparameter eigenvalue problem which is equivalent to a
system of generalized eigenvalue problems expressed in terms of operator
determinants. A structure exploiting Arnoldi algorithm is used to filter a
large portion of spurious solutions and to accelerate convergence.

Conclusion: 基于全局通量求积的新方法在保持稳态和收敛性方面具有显著优势，为双曲型平衡律系统提供了有效的数值解决方案。

Abstract: We consider linear, hyperbolic systems of balance laws in several space
dimensions. They possess non-trivial steady states, which result from the
equilibrium between derivatives of the unknowns in different directions, and
the sources. Standard numerical methods fail to account for this equilibrium,
and include stabilization that destroys it. This manifests itself in a
diffusion of states that are supposed to remain stationary. We derive new
stabilized high-order Finite Element methods based on a Global Flux quadrature:
we reformulate the entire spatial operator as a mixed derivative of a single
quantity, referred to as global flux. All spatial derivatives and the sources
are thus treated simultaneously, and our methods are stationarity preserving.
Additionally, when this formulation is combined with interpolation on
Gauss-Lobatto nodes, the new methods are super-convergent at steady state.
Formal consistency estimates, and strategies to construct well-prepared initial
data are provided. The numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions,
and show the tremendous benefits of the new formulation.

Abstract: We propose and rigorously analyze a novel family of explicit low-regularity
exponential integrators for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, based
on a time-relaxation framework. The methods combine a resonance-based scheme
for the twisted variable with a dynamically adjusted relaxation parameter that
guarantees exact mass conservation. Unlike existing symmetric or
structure-preserving low-regularity integrators, which are typically implicit
and computationally expensive, the proposed methods are fully explicit,
mass-conserving, and well-suited for solutions with low regularity.
Furthermore, the schemes can be naturally extended to a broad class of
evolution equations exhibiting the structure of strongly continuous contraction
semigroups. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and
excellent long-time behavior of the methods under low-regularity conditions.

Motivation: 大型海盐液滴（直径可达2mm）是控制飓风和强风暴加剧的最不确定因素之一，因为其生成机制尚未被理解。海浪飞溅产生最大的喷雾液滴，但观测数据难以获取，无法为当前建模工作提供信息。

Method: 引入两个圆柱形液体边缘的横向碰撞作为液滴产生的基本机制，通过三个竞争过程（韧带产生和合并、端部夹断产生液滴、重力终止机制）来表征液滴产生。构建理论模型解释碰撞边缘产生的液滴尺寸分布，并与现有实验和数值数据进行验证。

Result: 模型可以通过整合海况信息发展成完整的海盐气溶胶生成函数，具有相对较少的调谐参数。模型灵活，可以扩展以包含相关效应，如有限液滴寿命和二次破碎。

Conclusion: 该模型表明海浪飞溅可以高效产生大量二次液滴，挑战了先前认为它是海盐气溶胶低效生成机制的假设。

Abstract: Large sea spray drops - of up to 2mm in diameter - constitute one of the most
uncertain factors controlling the intensification of hurricanes and severe
storms because their generation mechanisms are not understood. Wave splashing
produces among the largest spray drops, but observational data regarding these
drops is difficult to obtain and hence cannot inform current modelling efforts.
In this study, we instead propose a sea spray generation function (SSGF) for
ocean wave splashing by assembling a model from first principles. First, we
introduce the transverse collision of two cylindrical liquid rims as the basic
mechanism for drop production. We characterize the resulting drop production in
terms of three competing processes: ligament production and merging, drop
generation by end-pinching, and gravity which arrests the mechanism. Second, we
formulate a theoretical model which explains the drop size distributions
produced by the colliding rims and test it against existing experimental and
numerical data. Finally, the model can be developed into a full SSGF by
incorporating sea state information with relatively few tuning parameters. The
model is flexible and can be extended by including related effects such as
finite droplet lifetime and secondary breakup. Altogether, our model suggests
that wave splashing can efficiently produce numerous secondary droplets,
challenging prior assumptions that it is an inefficient generation mechanism
for sea spray.

Abstract: Lubrication theory leverages the assumption of a long and thin fluid domain
to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Models
in extended lubrication theory consider relaxations of the thin film
assumption, leading to the inclusion of higher order terms. However, such
models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of
the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended

with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and
velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results
indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries.
Nonetheless, the magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are
both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication
theory models.

*Tilda Westling Dolling,A. Clara J. Henry,Josefin Ahlkrona*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了厚度稳定化方案(TSS)，一种适用于浅层架近似(SSA)模型的数值稳定化方法，通过将显式欧拉厚度演化方程整合到驱动应力项中实现隐式处理，显著提高了冰盖模拟的数值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决浅层架近似模型在冰盖模拟中的数值稳定性问题，特别是在高剪切场景下时间步长受限的挑战，提高计算效率。

Method: 将显式欧拉厚度演化方程整合到驱动应力项中，实现对该项的隐式处理，从而增强数值稳定性。

Result: TSS显著提高了SSA的数值稳定性，允许使用50-100年的大时间步长保持数值稳定和准确，在无TSS时高剪切模拟中时间步长超过5年就会出现显著误差。

Conclusion: TSS为冰盖建模提供了更大的灵活性，允许重新分配计算资源，该方法不仅适用于冰盖建模，也适用于其他耦合动量和几何演化方程的垂直积分计算流体动力学问题。

Abstract: We present the Thickness Stabilization Scheme (TSS), a numerical
stabilization scheme suitable for the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA), one of
the most widely-used models for large-scale Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet
simulations. The TSS is constructed by inserting an adapted, explicit Euler
thickness evolution equation into the driving stress term, thereby treating the
term implicitly. We investigate the applicability of TSS across low- and
high-shear idealized scenarios, by altering the inflow velocity and initial ice
thickness. TSS demonstrates an increase in the numerical stability of SSA,
allowing large time-step sizes of dt = 50-100 years to remain numerically
stable and accurate, while time-step sizes of dt > 5 in high-shear simulations
show significant error without TSS. Remarkably, a time step size as large as dt
= 10 000 years is numerically stable with TSS, albeit with a reduction in
accuracy. TSS offers greater flexibility for ice-sheet modeling by allowing the
re-allocation of computational resources. This method is applicable not only to
ice-sheet modeling, including in coupled frameworks, but also to other
vertically-integrated computational fluid dynamics problems that couple
momentum and geometry evolution equations.

*Daniel Dehtyriov,Jonathan F. MacArt,Justin Sirignano*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出一种在线优化框架，将DNS嵌入RANS子域中动态生成训练数据，解决深度学习流体模拟中高保真数据稀缺的问题，显著提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的深度学习流体模拟方法因高保真训练数据稀缺而容易过拟合，难以泛化到新的流动条件。

Method: 在RANS域的子域中嵌入DNS模拟，RANS为DNS提供边界条件，DNS提供平均速度和湍流统计量来在线更新深度学习闭合模型，形成反馈循环。

Result: 在线优化的RANS模型在随机强迫Burgers方程和湍流通道流中显著优于离线训练和文献校准的闭合模型，使用较小的DNS子域即可实现准确训练。

Conclusion: 该框架为物理信息机器学习闭合提供了可扩展的途径，实现了数据自适应的降阶模型，无需大型预计算训练数据集即可跨流动条件泛化。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing
the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the
scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and
inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures
trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to
generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for
DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to
address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is
dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a
subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to
the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that
are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop
enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance
on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The
approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for
turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying
embedded domain lengths $1\leq L_0/L\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models
significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated
closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains.
Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates
or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework
provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures,
enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes
without requiring large precomputed training datasets.

*Adrian E. Fraser,Alexis K. Kaminski,Jeffrey S. Oishi*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使在强磁场抑制线性不稳定的情况下，开尔文-亥姆霍兹不稳定性仍可通过有限时间增长机制产生显著扰动，挑战了基于线性稳定性推断磁场强度的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为强磁场会抑制开尔文-亥姆霍兹不稳定性，但观测中在强磁场环境下仍发现剪切驱动的波动，这与线性稳定性理论相矛盾。

Method: 通过计算有限时间内小振幅扰动的最大增长，分析亚阿尔文速度剪切流中的非模态增长机制。

Result: 即使在亚阿尔文速度条件下，扰动能量仍可增长数个数量级，磁场还引入了额外的非模态增长机制，且2D模拟无法捕捉这些机制的关键方面。

Conclusion: 剪切驱动湍流在强磁场环境中仍然可能发生，这挑战了基于线性稳定性观测来推断磁场强度的传统推断方法。

Abstract: In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is
generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong
streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds
on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not)
observed, on the basis that fluctuations cannot grow in the absence of linear
instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that
small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we
show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the
flow is sub-Alfv\'enic, suggesting that shear-driven turbulence is possible
even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from
the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show
that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative
to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these
growth mechanisms.

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个实时开放网络代理评估平台，通过收集用户提交的任务、进行Arena式对比测试和使用步骤级人工反馈来识别网络代理的失败模式。研究发现三种一致的失败模式：验证码解析、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网络环境下的评估平台来识别代理的实际失败模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式对比测试，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的失败模式构建针对性数据集。

Result: 识别出三种一致失败模式：验证码解析、弹窗移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略规避验证码，而DeepSeek-R1在验证码解析上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网络代理具有多样性和脆弱性，该基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理失败模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Motivation: 现有ShotBench基准存在选项设计模糊和ShotVL模型推理不一致的问题，影响了评估的可靠性，阻碍了电影摄影理解领域的公平比较和未来发展。

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统改进ShotBench，首次对ShotVL的推理行为进行批判性分析，并引入联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力的扩展评估协议。

Result: 开发了RefineShot基准，这是一个经过改进和扩展的基准测试，能够实现更可靠的评估，促进电影摄影理解领域的未来发展。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解提供了更可靠的评估框架，有助于该领域的公平比较和持续进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法来限制有害演示对LLM性能的影响，通过分布无关风险控制(DFRC)和动态提前退出机制，在保持零样本性能的同时防御恶意演示攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意演示可能影响模型行为，需要内置防御机制来保护模型免受攻击。

Method: 定义零样本下的安全行为基准，应用DFRC控制上下文样本导致的性能下降，使用动态提前退出预测机制，忽略关注不安全输入的注意力头。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文演示的风险，同时在有益演示上获得显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在防御恶意演示攻击的同时，保持模型性能并提高计算效率，为LLM安全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型中的一小部分注意力头负责传递空间关系表示，这些注意力头的激活（称为功能向量）可以被提取和操作来改变模型在关系任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型展现出令人印象深刻的上下文学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内部机制仍然不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持LMM参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量在推理时提高了零样本准确性，经过微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，并能通过线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: LMMs在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，从而增进对模型模块化的理解并增强对LMMs中关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Motivation: 研究基础模型在多模态任务中的联合推理能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在冲突证据时，模型是否能进行跨模态推理来调和冲突。

Method: 通过设计跨模态冲突实验来测试基础模型的性能，分析注意力机制中的不平衡问题，并提出通过显式组合多模态训练实例的简单可扩展方法来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示基础模型在跨模态冲突情境下表现显著下降，从单模态的90%识别率降至跨模态的3%。提出的方法能有效减少注意力不平衡，并在多个视觉语言基准测试中提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 跨模态注意力不平衡是基础模型在多模态推理中的关键问题，需要系统性地解决跨模态上下文问题来构建可靠的基础模型。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

TL;DR: 本文发现传统测试时扩展(TTS)在样本数量K增大到一定程度后收益递减，提出温度维度扩展方法，通过多温度采样显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到与RL训练模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法仅通过增加样本数量K来提升推理性能，但这种方法在K较大时收益递减，且某些难题无论多少样本都无法解决。研究发现不同采样温度能解决不同子集的问题，表明单温度扩展只探索了模型潜力的一部分。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，在多个采样温度下生成推理轨迹，扩大模型的推理边界。设计了多温度投票方法以减少温度扩展的开销。

Result: 在Qwen3系列模型(0.6B-8B)和五个代表性推理基准测试中，温度扩展比单温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点。基础模型通过温度扩展能达到与RL训练模型相当的性能，无需额外后训练。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展比之前认为的更强大，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

Abstract: This study presents the development of Geolog-IA, a novel conversational
system based on artificial intelligence that responds naturally to questions
about geology theses from the Central University of Ecuador. Our proposal uses
the Llama 3.1 and Gemini 2.5 language models, which are complemented by a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and an SQLite database. This
strategy allows us to overcome problems such as hallucinations and outdated
knowledge. The evaluation of Geolog-IA's performance with the BLEU metric

### [247] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可能性概念作为Zadeh(1978)标准概念的替代方案，专注于现实世界事件的可能性计算，适用于规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代现有的标准可能性概念，专注于现实世界事件的可能性评估，特别是规划问题中的可行性分析。

Method: 将事件视为具有促成其发生的先决条件和阻碍其发生的约束条件，通过计算先决条件成立且约束条件不成立的概率函数来确定事件可能性。

Result: 开发了一种新的可能性理论，能够评估多个规划方案中哪个最容易或最可行完成，并提供了车辆路径规划的示例。

Conclusion: 该可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类关于规划的正常推理过程，具有在规划问题中应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

TL;DR: AutoMaAS是一个自进化的多智能体架构搜索框架，通过神经架构搜索原则自动发现最优智能体配置，在性能提升1.0-7.1%的同时降低推理成本3-5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源，需要更灵活的多智能体系统设计方法。

Method: 采用神经架构搜索原则，包含四个关键创新：自动算子生成、融合和消除；动态成本感知优化；在线反馈集成；决策追踪机制增强可解释性。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，相比最先进方法，性能提升1.0-7.1%，推理成本降低3-5%，在数据集和LLM骨干网络上表现出优异的可迁移性。

Conclusion: AutoMaAS为大语言模型时代的自动化多智能体系统设计建立了新范式，具有优越的性能和成本效益。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标视觉语言模型的有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型(VLMs)的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖手动工程，缺乏对新兴现实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议(MCP)集成17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs实现了最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了ARMs-Bench数据集，包含超过30K红队实例，涵盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: ARMs显著提高了红队实例的多样性，揭示了VLM的新兴漏洞。使用ARMs-Bench进行安全微调可大幅提高VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供可操作指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造业中，将制造需求转化为正式约束的过程仍然依赖手动操作且劳动密集，而现有LLM方法存在自然语言歧义、非确定性输出和领域知识有限的问题。

Method: 设计了一个约束中心架构，通过层次化结构空间和领域特定表示来规范LLM，并开发了自动化生产场景适配算法来定制特定制造配置。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法成功平衡了LLM的生成能力与制造系统的可靠性需求，在约束规范任务中显著优于纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: 该约束中心架构为自动化生产调度约束规范提供了可靠解决方案，有效结合了LLM的灵活性和制造系统的精确性要求。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法验证多步推理存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力分散，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: NCV将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二元一致性检查，通过将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点来避免不必要生成长文本。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NCV相比基线方法F1分数提升10%到25%，同时比传统方法如基于CoT的验证器减少6-58倍的token使用量。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，增强了可解释性和效率，为可靠的LLM推理验证提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配评估，但随着解决用户请求所需步骤增加，需要超越最终答案来评估问题解决轨迹，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等被忽视的方面。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累前面推理步骤的知识，实现对代理推理轨迹的多方面分析和评估。创建新的元评估数据集，通过增强现有基准测试并添加多样且有缺陷的轨迹来验证框架。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，具有可扩展性和成本效益，即使使用小型开源LLM也能实现。应用该方法评估代理在解决工具增强任务时产生的轨迹，提供了先前未报告的观察和相应见解。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强型LLM代理提供了有效的多维度评估方法，能够全面评估推理轨迹的各个方面，解决了传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)，指出在现实条件下由于近似、估计和优化误差，模型无法真正满足指定目标函数，且开发者的意图无法完美转化为形式化目标。基于Goodhart定律，作者主张对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制，避免失控风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中未被充分检验的目标满足假设(OSA)，揭示其在现实条件下的系统性偏差问题，特别是考虑到开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标的根本限制。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的分析框架，结合近似误差、估计误差和优化误差的理论分析，并基于Goodhart定律的数学结果进行论证。

Result: 证明OSA在现实条件下必然失败，目标错配不可避免，且在缺乏数学表征的情况下，这些差距与Goodhart定律的失效模式无法区分。

Conclusion: 由于无法预先确定Goodhart临界点，必须对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致可预测且不可逆的失控风险。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

TL;DR: 提出了BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线奖励模型强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，动态选择奖励模型来提升语言模型对齐质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF/RLAIF流程依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并可能导致过拟合。虽然已有研究探索奖励模型路由方法，但存在冷启动和探索不足的问题

Method: 采用混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器评估每个奖励模型的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行按查询的奖励模型选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K, MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter持续优于单个奖励模型、奖励模型集成和现有路由方法

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过有效的奖励模型路由机制，解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了语言模型对齐的性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

TL;DR: MaskGRPO是首个可行的离散扩散模型强化学习方法，通过重要性采样和模态特定适配，解决了DDM优化中的采样和rollout难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDM）的优化面临挑战：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理，rollout复杂，导致GRPO等强化学习方法难以应用。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建重要性估计器捕捉有价值的token波动；然后为视觉序列精心设计rollout方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来更稳定高效的更新，实现了更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: MaskGRPO建立了一个系统性的策略优化方法，是离散化视觉扩散的首个实用途径。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用。可解释AI方法旨在通过提供模型决策过程的解释来克服这一挑战，但这些方法通常由具有技术背景的研究人员开发，并融入了他们对不同解释机制存在性、有效性和解释效用的假设。

Method: 研究可解释性方法应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，即我们对解释存在性以及获取这些解释知识能力的假设。分析显示，XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化可能对应着关于解释基础假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析揭示了XAI方法中隐含的本体论和认识论假设对AI解释有效性和解释的重要影响。忽视基础的本体-认识论范式在选择XAI方法时存在风险。

Conclusion: 需要关注XAI方法中的基础假设，在选择XAI方法时考虑其本体论和认识论基础，并为不同应用领域选择和适配适当的XAI方法，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 虽然反事实解释在可解释AI中是一个强大工具，但在基于规则的智能环境领域尚无成熟的生成方法。

Method: 开发了一个插件来扩展现有的智能环境解释引擎，并进行了用户研究(N=17)来评估生成的反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户偏好高度情境化：因果解释因其语言简洁性和在时间压力下的适用性更受青睐，而反事实解释因其可操作内容在用户想要解决问题时更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 本研究为智能环境中的新型解释提供了实用框架，并为选择最有效的解释类型提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Result: transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略规则时准确率急剧下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间的差距凸显了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了深度学习模型推理机制的新见解，强调需要超越模式识别、发展具备鲁棒抽象推理能力的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Motivation: 连续扩散模型理论上比离散扩散模型和循环变换器具有更强的表达能力，但在实践中表现不佳，主要原因是连续表示到离散标记空间的解码困难。

Method: 提出协同进化连续离散扩散(CCDD)，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义多模态扩散过程，使用单一模型同时进行联合空间去噪。

Result: CCDD在真实世界语言建模任务中展现出强大的实证性能，具有丰富的潜在空间语义和良好的训练性及样本质量。

Conclusion: CCDD成功结合了连续和离散两种模态的优势，既保持了连续空间的丰富语义表达能力，又通过离散标记获得了良好的训练性和样本质量。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
