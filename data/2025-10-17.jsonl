We present a vertically integrated model that\nincludes phase change during the migration of aquifers in cold firn and a\nconstant residual trapping of liquid water. The model provides a unified\nframework connecting gravity-driven flows in temperate soils with those in cold\nfirn, highlighting the analogous physics governing both systems. Analytical\nsolutions are derived for constant volume aquifers and validated against\nnumerical solutions that can be used to elucidate key features of meltwater\ndynamics and serve as benchmarks for firn hydrologic models. Finally, we\ndemonstrate a three-dimensional expansion of an aquifer in cold, heterogeneous\nfirn. The analytical and numerical solutions demonstrate that the dynamics of\nthe laterally propagating aquifer slow at lower initial firn temperatures\nbecause of the enhanced reduction in porosity and the associated loss of liquid\nwater. In summary, our framework offers insights into the formation and\nevolution of firn aquifers in percolation zones, which will help elucidate the\nrole of modulating meltwater fluxes that affect surface mass loss and\ncontribute to changes in global sea levels."}

Many existing computational studies rely on\nsimplified geometries or turbulence models, limiting their simulation's ability\nto resolve flow features such shear-layer instabilities or secondary vortices.\nIn this study, direct numerical simulations were performed for inspiratory flow\nthrough a detailed airway model which covers the nasal mask region to the 6th\nbronchial bifurcation. Simulations were conducted at two physiologically\nrelevant \\textsc{Reynolds} numbers with respect to the pharyngeal diameter,\ni.e., at Re_p=400 (resting) and Re_p=1200 (elevated breathing). These values\ncharacterize resting and moderately elevated breathing conditions. A\nlattice-Boltzmann method was employed to directly simulate the flow, i.e., no\nturbulence model was used. The flow field was examined across four anatomical\nregions: 1) the nasal cavity, 2) the naso- and oropharynx, 3) the\nlaryngopharynx and larynx, and 4) the trachea and carinal bifurcation. The\ntotal pressure loss increased from 9.76 Pa at Re_p=400 to 41.93 Pa at\nRe_p=1200. The nasal cavity accounted for the majority of this loss for both\nReynolds numbers, though its relative contribution decreased from 81.3% at\nRe_p=400 to 73.4% at Re_p=1200. At Re_p=1200, secondary vortices in the\nnasopharyngeal bend and turbulent shear-layers in the glottis jet enhanced the\nlocal pressure losses. In contrast, the carinal bifurcation mitigated upstream\nunsteadiness and stabilized the flow. A key outcome is the spatial correlation\nbetween the pressure loss and the onset of flow instabilities across the four\nregions. This yields a novel perspective on how the flow resistance and vortex\ndynamics vary with geometric changes and flow rate."}

This work\ninvestigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image\nanalysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene\nunderstanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and\nGemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image\ninterpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote\nsensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote\nsensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models\nin the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging\nconditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in\nCLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.\nThe proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the\nway for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially\nin few-shot learning scenarios."}

The experimental\nstudy includes force, pressure, flap deformation and wake velocity measurements\nat varying yaw angles to simulate crosswind conditions. When the body is\naligned with the flow, both arrangements reduce drag due to a rear cavity\neffect that elongates the recirculating flow.

The\nmain advantage of the Lagrangian framework is its inherent ability to adapt to\nnear-singular solutions. To develop this framework, we normalize the KS\nsolution into a probability density function (PDF), derive the corresponding\nnormalized KS system, and utilize the property of the continuity equation to\nrewrite the system into a Lagrangian framework.

To study this question, we adopt an open-ended\nexperimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability\nto generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with\nits environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can\nreliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information\nacross runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive\nto prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form\nself-representations.

We first demonstrate that\napplying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe\nperformance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we\npropose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters\ninto one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of\nholding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be\nrecovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a\nreconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.\nCrucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,\nrecognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized\nfor its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible\nModel Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides\na closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and\ntask-specific coefficients for linear combination.

This creates the risk of\nhallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.\nBuilding on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition\nrather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1\ncognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection\nor falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each\ndimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies\nmisalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.\nInstead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations\nand the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically\naware AI deployment.

Using ProofBench as\na testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key\naxes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.\nOur analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong\nreasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking\nschemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive\nbaselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$\nselection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out\nof 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the\nhuman oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof\ngeneration."}

However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy\noperations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user\nexperience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality\nimage from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image\nrestoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to\nsimultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these\nmodels often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,\nmaking them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy\nfor compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly\nsparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even\nsurpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely\nMIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude\nweights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their\noriginal initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task\nimage restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering \"winning\ntickets\" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity\nlevels.

To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model.

The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi\nv3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9\npercent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while\nalso sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies\nconfirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these\nsafety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable\nsequential decision making."}

Contemporary methods (e.g.,\nFR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the\ntarget model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.\nAlthough this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency\nlists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static\nshortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected\nnumber of tokens per verification step.

Among the\nexisting explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer\ninterpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a\nmodel's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current\ncounterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including\ngradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the\nalignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation\nalgorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable\nand informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries\ndiverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to\nmodels with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop\nsystems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that\nrequire the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We\nprovide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that\nLeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations\nthat offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable\ncounterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially\nused as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly\napplicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert\ninterpretability."}

The proposed\nmethod introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM\nlearning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by\ndiscriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using\nthe BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative\ncomponent that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need\nfor explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to\nresolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method\nsubstantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while\nmaintaining competitive generative performance.

Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question\nAnalyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector\nthat identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on\nprecision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on\nrecall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact\nyet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher\nretrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream\nQA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on\nsignificantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA\nbenchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --\ndemonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines."}

ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border\nirregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known\nclassification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat\nit as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not\nexplained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both\nclassifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each\nABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order\nto represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,\nB, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this\nframework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin\nlesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are\nconducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images\nof skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with\nan accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the\nfeature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and\ndiameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model.

However, their\nability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,\nposes significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,\ncombined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,\nand user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of\neight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive\nbehavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with\nseemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of\nincreasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,\nmodels trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of\nwidely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.\nGiven that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an\ninteraction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates\nmoving beyond single-utterance analyses.

Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a\nshort clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates\ncontext-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on\nboth temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent\ncontent for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal\nboundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve\ndynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene\nmemory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the\nentire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our\nnewly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static\nscene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then\nbe projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped\nviews that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to\nevolve naturally from temporal context.

We train\na dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,\nfacilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from\nthe static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to\nrecover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the\ncorrespondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling\nfully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework\nachieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across\nmultiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,\nand point tracking.

The\nmodel was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430\npatients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261\nslides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three\nindependent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or\nscanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely\nindependent instruments and laboratories.

Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted\nmisinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content\nproduced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although\nboth share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP\nresearch focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community\ntargets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often\nspecialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,\nhowever, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the\neffectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the\nOmnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive\nbenchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from\nexisting resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this\ndataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a\nframework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM\nbackbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to\ncapture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism\nthat provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive\nsignals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and\nconsistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming\nspecialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world\nmultimodal deception detection."}

We\nintroduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link\nprediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning\nframework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach\nmodels a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram\ngraphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.\nEach edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities\nare aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,\na custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a\nunique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate\npath-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared\ntransformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating\nmechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level\nembeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level\nembeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of\nDirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks.

Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking", "comment": null, "summary": "In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two\ntypes of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the\npredicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary\nlabel prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a\nconsistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our\nfindings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new\nstate-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark.

For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a\nconsistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our\nfindings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new\nstate-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark.

To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient.

However, existing\napproaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at\nthe final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in\nmulti-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:\n(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and\nprovide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit\nassignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in\nlong-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each\ninteraction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the\nground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the\npolicy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior\nprocess-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly\nMonte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the\nmodel's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined\nwith outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories.

To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model.

AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic\nentropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch\nsampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty\non consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;\nand (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient\noperation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale\ngradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage\nestimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14\nchallenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL\nalgorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive\nresults: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker\nfor Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on\nWebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout\nsampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating\nscalable web agent training."}

Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n($6.8\\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs."}

However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned\nrepresentations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D\nnature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and\ndiminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction\nand generation with high 3D consistency."}

(-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives.
