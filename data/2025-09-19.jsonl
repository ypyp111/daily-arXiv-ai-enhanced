With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective\nmulti-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for\nlarge-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on\nindividual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination\nand rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework\nis presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with\nheterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model\nis proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally\nefficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous\nqualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation\nand shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed\nnetwork model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro\ndemonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both\ncost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by\nincorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during\ndisruptions.

The rotating reference frame of cross-flow turbine blades\nresults in virtual camber and incidence due to streamline curvature, altering\nthe lift, drag and pitching moment of the blades. Adding geometric camber is\ntherefore likely to alter performance and loading, however there is little\nconsensus regarding the direction of camber that might be most favorable. This\nstudy compares 2% concave-in and concave-out cambered blades (NACA 2418) with\nsymmetrical NACA 0018 foils for a turbine with a 0.49 chord-to-radius ratio.\nExperimental performance measurements are compared across a range of\ntip-speeds, and particle image velocimetry is used to explore the in-rotor flow\nevolution through the cycle. Concave-out blades, which enhance virtual camber\nand lift in the power stroke are found to exhibit sub-optimal performance. In\ncontrast, concave-in cambered blades slightly improved symmetrical blade\nperformance by enhancing downstream flow reattachment, more than compensating\nfor reduced peak power generation. The difference between each cambered foil is\nseen to grow with increasing tip-speed ratio. Moreover, these concave-in blades\nreduce peak loading by 13%, which may prove critical in future designs,\nespecially at high tip-speed ratios. Exploration of the near-blade flow fields\nsuggest that the influence of geometric camber is non-linear, and that use of a\nsimplistic summation of both geometric and virtual camber to account for camber\neffects may be overly simplistic.

Overall, the present study represents the synthesis of 140\npublications on different types of toxic content on digital platforms. We\npresent a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in previous studies\nfocusing on definitions, data sources, challenges, and machine learning\napproaches employed in detecting online toxicity, such as hate speech,\noffensive language, and harmful discourse. The dataset encompasses content in\n32 languages, covering topics such as elections, spontaneous events, and\ncrises. We examine the possibility of using existing cross-platform data to\nimprove the performance of classification models. We present the\nrecommendations and guidelines for new research on online toxic consent and the\nuse of content moderation for mitigation. Finally, we present some practical\nguidelines to mitigate toxic content from online platforms."}

However,\nexisting LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with\nhigh-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the\ndata's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for\nHigh-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates\ndirectly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT\npreserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and\nsecond-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,\nand it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),\nhigher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An\nalternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to\nefficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core\ntensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information\nof high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved\nclassification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,\nimages and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior\nclassification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and\nprior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker\nMachines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest\naccuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results\nconfirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling\nhigh-dimensional tensor data for classification."}

Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation.

Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks.

Recent\nwork has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal\nrepresentations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;\nSMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can\nenhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.\n  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for\nhallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them\nacross three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact.

In addition, a lightweight low-rank\nAdaLN-Zero modulation mechanism is proposed and reduces model size by 15%\nwithout compromising accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that FlowCast-ODE\noutperforms strong baselines, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE) and\nbetter energy conservation, which reduces blurring and preserves more\nfine-scale spatial details. It also shows comparable performance to the\nstate-of-the-art model in forecasting extreme events like typhoons.\nFurthermore, the model alleviates temporal discontinuities associated with\nassimilation cycle transitions."}

We show that\nLLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference\ndisambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they\ncannot do both at the same time.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate\nand efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised\nby a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)\nPatch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse\nhinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint\nOptimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive\ndown-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A\nTwo-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by\na trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses.

In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for\nImage Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image\nclassification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an\nOutliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted\nprompts.

FURINA eliminates the\nrouter by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity\nbetween the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,\nwhich are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the\noutput norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby\nenabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further\nsharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard\nMoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA\nblock that provides stable, foundational knowledge.

We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference.

Existing\nstudies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all\ntest instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually\nassign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human\nannotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE\nframework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new\nrelations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding\nand generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our\nframework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),\ndesigned to predict new relations for test instances based on\n\\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and\n(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a\ntest instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \\textit{demonstrations}\ncomposed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict\nnew relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three\nstages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the\nfirst stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test\ninstances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for\neach new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation\nmethod. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all\ntest instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test\ninstances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. We release our code at\nhttps://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/LLM-OREF.git."}

While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness.
