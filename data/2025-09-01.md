Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

### [2] [Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088)
*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现CNN与随机森林的混合模型表现最佳，准确率达到85.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供可靠的技术支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用包含1,512张X射线图像的数据集，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN与传统分类器的混合模型、以及微调的预训练架构，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN-随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN（74.3%），VGG16在预训练模型中表现最好（82.3%）

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align方法通过Query-Query对齐解决零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，在保持结构一致性的同时显著提升外观保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中面临的注意力泄漏挑战，该问题源于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射不准确

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细的空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化以保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更精确的语义对齐和更好的性能表现

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存累积误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用残差分析、轨迹感知校正和闭式残差线性化等方法，在保持视觉质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，特征缓存虽然是有前景的加速策略，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存引起的误差。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍的推理加速，同时保持甚至改善视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速且VBench退化最小。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统分析缓存误差并联合校正两种主要误差类型，实现了高效准确的采样，在保持基准保真度的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)新任务，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，解决了视频大语言模型在细粒度时间语义理解上的挑战，在训练和推理阶段都实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选，但当前视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和帧间理解监督不充而无法抓取细粒度时间语义。

Method: 提出时间视觉筛选(TVS)任务，包括：(1)保留重点关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询为最直接形式保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性。TVS作为模块化前端适配器任务集成到视频指令循环和视频问答管道中。

Result: 建立了首个TVS基准测试集，提出的ReSimplifyIt基线模型在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法提升0.47的F-1分数，并在查询重写任务上达到竞争力表现。实验显示，集成TVS在训练阶段获得7.33%相对提升，在推理阶段获得34.6%相对提升。

Conclusion: TVS通过优化理解负担分布和认知负荷，在训练时对齐查询与重点视觉信息，在推理时支持查询感知段落聚焦和流线型查询表达，显示了时间信息筛选对改善视频-语言理解的有效性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用骨骼姿态标注作为手术工具定位的更高效标注方法，并发布了ROBUST-MIPS数据集来促进这种标注方式的采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的手术工具定位方法受限于标注数据的多样性，需要更高效的标注方式来加速标注数据的增长。

Method: 提出骨骼姿态标注方法，从现有ROBUST-MIS数据集衍生出包含工具姿态和实例分割的ROBUST-MIPS数据集，并使用流行的姿态估计方法建立基准测试。

Result: 观察到使用姿态标注进行手术工具定位可获得高质量结果，证明了这种标注方式的充分性。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注在语义信息丰富度和标注便捷性之间取得了良好平衡，是手术工具定位的有效标注方式，为此发布了数据集和标注软件以促进采用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件向锁定模型注入安全控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效和灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁方式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在6个不同T2I模型上的评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他7种最先进的安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control提供了一种有效、灵活且兼容性强的安全解决方案，能够显著减少T2I模型中的不安全内容生成，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，在存在性预测和分割方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车于五个不同地理位置的城区进行的真实世界实验中，GENNAV表现出优异的零样本迁移性能和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV在目标区域识别任务中表现出卓越性能，特别是在处理stuff-type目标区域和多目标场景方面，证明了其在真实世界环境中的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一种自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度智能决定是否启用思考过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思考过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够自适应决定是否思考的模型来提高效率。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，让模型同时具备思考和非思考能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)提高模型判断是否激活思考过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506(16B)模型性能相当，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算开销，为高效多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的RGB、热成像和深度数据融合框架，用于检测遮挡或伪装目标，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来解决多模态环境中的隐藏物体检测问题。

Method: 提出HiddenObject融合框架，使用基于Mamba的融合机制整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，捕获跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或竞争性性能，证明了融合设计的有效性并揭示了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构可以显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现椎体级别的CT/X-ray配准，在噪声X射线下表现出优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，现有双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声处理困难。

Method: 提出双平面X射线椎体RadGS重建模块，采用基于学习的辐射高斯重建方法和反事实注意力学习机制，结合患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验显示，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg框架有效解决了CT/X-ray配准中的准确性和实时性要求，特别是在噪声X射线下的椎体重建和配准方面表现出色。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来推动3D建筑生成算法的发展。

Method: 创建包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义丰富3D线框图、对应平面图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为开发能够根据预定义平面布局和屋顶几何自动生成语义几何一致的LoD 4级别3D建筑模型的生成算法提供了重要数据集基础。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAV在不同层独立计算时存在概念表示不一致的问题，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来确保概念表示的语义一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局整合的CAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示的效果。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致问题，增强了概念定位能力并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，有助于更好地理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个新颖的视觉上下文提示框架，通过在上下文中使用示例作为提示，使模型能够直接泛化到未见过的物体类别，无需参数调整或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个新类别训练专门的模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM（如DINO）通过动态视觉提示提取身份判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上的表现明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过语义概念与视觉先验的对齐，实现了对新类别的零样本泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在Auto3DSeg架构下，对MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务进行评估，结果显示T1加权图像分割效果优于T2加权图像，但整体性能仍有待提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分，使用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在解剖相关感兴趣区域进行训练和评估。

Result: 任务1（T1加权MRI）的DSC为0.56，任务2（T2加权MRI）的DSC降至0.33，显示不同MRI序列对分割性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 尽管性能一般，但结果展示了自动化分割的潜力，并强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型的鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过反演推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型在不同成像序列间泛化能力差，主要原因是图像对比度的显著差异，尽管这些图像都由相同的自旋物理属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过求解非线性逆问题从观测图像反演推断底层自旋属性；2）使用扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）基于估计的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像中获得有意义的自旋属性估计，实现高度灵活的图像合成，使分割模型在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下都能实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定的形状信息来提高视频中的姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为形状条件化的3D姿态先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用性设计，在优化2D对齐时忽略了用户特定身体形状和3D姿态合理性，导致3D精度受损。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件化的3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐的姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，且仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块增强现有3D姿态估计器性能。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效减少对2D约束的过度依赖，在数据效率和性能提升方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

TL;DR: 通过分层时间剪枝策略（HTP）在保持主要运动特征的同时，大幅减少传播模型在3D人体姿估计中的计算成本和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传播模型在生成高保真度3D人体姿势方面表现优异，但其迭代性质和多假设要求导致计算成本较高，需要提高效率。

Method: 提出分层时间剪枝策略（HTP）：1）TCEP通过适应性时间图构建分析帧间运动相关性识别关键帧；2）SFT MHSA利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3）MGPTP通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP减少训练MACs 38.5%，推理MACs 56.8%，推理速度提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该策略在显著降低计算复杂度的同时保持了传播模型的高性能，为高效率3D人体姿估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Print2Volume是一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真合成OCT 3D指纹的框架，解决了OCT数据稀缺问题，显著提升了指纹识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模公开数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习算法的发展

Method: 三阶段框架：1）2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2）3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3）基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声特征

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本的大规模数据集，通过在合成数据上预训练并在小规模真实数据上微调，将等错误率从15.62%显著降低到2.50%

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升指纹识别性能，为深度学习模型提供了宝贵的数据资源

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布将促进更先进的计算机视觉和机器学习方法在妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析中的发展，改善术后活动如治疗规划、病例记录和教育

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割（二值分割）和(2)器械识别（多类识别）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量较少，也能以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域；但确定具体器械类型仍然非常困难，因为手术器械具有固有的高度相似性。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割取得了良好效果，但器械类型识别仍需进一步研究改进，主要挑战在于器械间的高度相似性。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Conclusion: 该标准框架能够有效地管理大规模WSI集合，提高AI算法训练和验证的效率，具有广泛的应用前景

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型增量学习新知识。现有的类增量学习方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这在实践中不现实

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制，支持从未标注数据集进行增量学习

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比监督方法取得竞争性结果，在最终准确率上比最先进的class-iNCD方法高出5%以上

Conclusion: ICPL方法有效解决了无标注数据下的增量学习问题，在细粒度数据集上展示了实际应用价值，计算复杂度验证了其在资源受限环境中的适用性

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在动态场景扩展中存在密集高斯数据量大和每帧训练时间长的限制，需要更高效的流式任务训练框架。

Method: 使用基于锚点的分层高斯球体结构，粗粒度高斯表示场景低分辨率结构，细粒度高斯负责细节渲染；引入混合变形和生成策略建模帧间运动；采用双向自适应掩码机制去除静态区域并优先处理信息丰富的视角。

Result: 大量实验表明，\M在显著减少训练时间的同时，实现了优于最先进方法的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了动态3D高斯溅射的训练效率问题，为实时沉浸式应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级图像描述模型，参数量仅为125M，比LLaMA-7B小56倍，性能却可与大型多模态通用模型相媲美，并开发了Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架来解决视觉盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署，需要开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述解决方案。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并通过DeepLens提取详细视觉表示，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架通过改进视觉接地来提升描述质量。

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现与大型通用模型相当，但存在视觉盲区问题，新框架有效缓解了这一问题。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型具有在设备端应用的潜力，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架通过增强视觉表示有效提升了描述准确性。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术（特征截断或评分函数），或针对特定类型OOD数据集，忽略了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分方法，统一结合最先进的特征截断技术和多种评分函数，通过集成多个评分函数来增强对各种类型OOD样本的鲁棒性。

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，涵盖近OOD和远OOD场景，MME在所有基准测试中显著优于最新方法。使用BiT模型在ImageNet-1K基准上达到平均FPR95为27.57%，比最佳现有基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效结合，多方法集成策略能够显著提升OOD检测性能，为安全关键应用提供更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 现有的数据变换方法在提高对抗性示例转移性时，通过过度增强图像背景或无关区域，可能导致目标检测模型的误检，这些错误并非由对抗性补丁本身引起，而是由背景和非目标区域的过度增强造成。

Method: 提出局部增强方法，仅对目标区域进行数据增强，避免影响非目标区域。通过减少背景干扰，让损失函数更直接关注对抗性补丁对检测模型的影响。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够有效提高对抗性补丁攻击的成功率，并增强其转移性。

Conclusion: 通过局部化的数据增强策略，可以更有效地提升对抗性攻击的性能，避免了因背景干扰导致的误检问题，为遥感图像船舶检测系统的安全防护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对长视频幻觉的基准测试ELV-Halluc，专门研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而加剧，并通过位置编码和DPO策略有效减少了27.7%的SAH比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。之前的幻觉基准主要关注短视频，而长视频中由于多个事件的语义复杂性增加，语义聚合幻觉(SAH)变得尤为关键。

Method: 引入ELV-Halluc基准测试系统研究SAH；通过实验确认SAH存在并分析其特性；采用位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH；构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实SAH确实存在且随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；位置编码策略有助于缓解SAH；DPO策略显著改善了模型区分事件内和事件间语义的能力；在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比例大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: SAH是长视频理解中的重要幻觉类型，需要专门的研究和缓解策略。通过位置编码和DPO训练可以有效减少语义聚合幻觉，为提升视频多模态大语言模型的长视频理解能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Motivation: 现有的基于patch的基础模型特征在显微镜图像分析中存在两个问题：1) 难以表示微结构中的精细特征 2) 处理大尺寸图像时计算效率低

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快速度产生高质量分割结果

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了显微镜图像分割的效率和质量，比传统卷积网络的训练或微调方法更加高效

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，通过分层跨粒度对比和匹配学习实现了优异的性能和强大的零样本泛化能力

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Motivation: 传统Gaussian splatting需要密集观测且无法重建遮捆和未观测区域，因此需要一种能够从单张图像生成完整场景的方法

Method: 使用变分自动重构器(Variational AutoReconstructor)从2D图像自监督学习潜在空间，然后在该空间上训练漫散模型来生成条件化的3D Gaussian splatting表示

Result: 方法能够生成准确的重建结果和多样性样本，完成遮捆表面的高质量360度渲染

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法有效解决了单图3D重建中的多模态问题，为完整场景生成提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习时间分布并支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间背景或专注于分类/回归任务，无法进行细粒度空间预测，且往往局限于单时间点、特定疾病或有其他技术限制。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)，一种生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多个先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特例。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基准。

Conclusion: TFM解决了医学成像中时间动态建模的基本差距，提供了一个统一的框架来学习时间分布并进行细粒度空间预测，在多个数据集上表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了通过深度学习整合预临CT和本后病理全手片图像，提高清洁细胞肾益癌复发风险预测的方法，证明了多模态融合的效果优于单一模态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Leibovich评分在清洁细胞肾益癌复发风险分层中存在病人级别分辨率有限且缺少形态学信息的问题，需要更个性化的预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，整合预临CT和本后病理全手片图像，通过预训练编码器和Cox生存模型进行测试，测试了单模态、后期融合和中间融合等不同设置。

Result: 病理图像基础模型表现一致超过CT单模态，中间融合进一步提升了性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。形态学信息通过融合主要添加了价值。

Conclusion: 证明了基础模型基于多模态整合进行个性化肾益癌复发风险预测的可行性，未来需要探索更表达力强的融合策略和更大的多模态数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了从单词级到行级OCR的转变，绕过词语分割错误并提供更大语境上下文，实现了准确性和效率的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，而现代字符序列识别技术将粒度推向单词级后，词语分割成为了新的缺点。论文识别到这个问题并提出向行级OCR迅速转变的需求。

Method: 提出了一种从单词级到行级OCR的自然进化方法，直接识别整行文本而非单独词语，避免了词语分割错误，同时提供更大的句子级语境上下文。

Result: 实验结果显示端到端准确性提升5.4%，效率提升4倍，证明了行级OCR的优势。论文还创建了包含251个英语页面图像的行级注释数据集。

Conclusion: 行级OCR方法不仅提高了识别准确性和效率，还为利用大语言模型的未来发展打下基础，尤其适用于文档图像处理领域。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度展开网络(DUN)，通过自适应带宽保持模型和相位域复值去噪器来解决计算机生成全息术中的非线性不适定问题，实现了超过35dB的PSNR和更宽的工作距离。

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法存在三个主要问题：(i)端到端网络忽略物理关系，降低可解释性和灵活性；(ii)CNN方法感受野有限，难以捕捉长程依赖；(iii)角谱方法局限于有限近场。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)。ABPM扩展工作距离，PCD采用复值可变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上实现了超过35dB的PSNR，达到了最先进的性能，同时相比角谱方法具有更宽的工作距离范围。

Conclusion: 所提出的DUN方法通过结合物理模型和深度学习，有效解决了CGH中的非线性不适定问题，在保持物理可解释性的同时显著提升了重建性能。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决全身PET/CT病变分割中的挑战：追踪剂异质性、生理性吸收和多中心变异性。应对临床实践中需要人机协作来高效精炼分割结果的需求。

Method: 扩展nnU-Net管道，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道。系统研究空间提示表示方法，实现用户交互在线模拟和自定义点采样策略。

Result: 法线距离变换(EDT)编码表现一致超过高斯内核。基于EDT的组合模型在交叉验证中获得最佳性能，显著减少了假阳性和假阴性结果。

Conclusion: 可提示模型在多追踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有开启高效用户导向分割工作流的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用基于注意力的标准映射技术存在泛化问题，经常产生不存在的道路元素幻觉，需要更准确的图像空间到BEV空间的映射方法

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上表现优于最先进方法，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离挑战场景中改进显著

Conclusion: 该方法通过概率投影和置信度机制有效解决了现有方法的泛化问题，提高了HD地图构建的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法需要企业级GPU和大量合成图像的高计算成本问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行微调，构建轻量级合成数据生成管道，大幅降低计算资源需求。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上验证，仅用500张合成图像就比ODGEN基线5000张图像性能提升高达21.3% mAP@.50:.95，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 质量与效率并重的方法比暴力生成更有效，FLORA以10%的数据量和计算成本实现了最先进性能，使高级合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗样本检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络架构或影响原始模型性能，需要一种无需修改模型的高效检测方法

Method: 在VGG-16等CNN的早期卷积层并行监测激活熵变化，利用对抗样本引起的7%熵偏移进行检测

Result: 实现了90%的检测准确率，假阳性和假阴性率均低于20%，干净样本和对抗样本的熵分布完全分离

Conclusion: CNN激活熵可以作为可靠的对抗样本检测指标，实现实时自诊断视觉系统而不影响原始模型性能

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前域泛化评估方法对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖现有基准。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的域感知表示；2）通过合成生成多样化域数据；3）鼓励从域特征中分离实现域不变分类。

Result: CLIP-DCA相比现有方法在更具挑战性的评估中显示出显著改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上性能提升明显。

Conclusion: 增强域感知是基础模型中实现有效域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过分离分类和增强域感知表示的方法有效解决了CLIP在域泛化中的性能退化问题。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

### [53] [Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773)
*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)方法，通过核密度估计和新颖检测来处理无任务边界和标签的视频序列学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的时空特征，但在无监督持续学习领域得到的关注较少。现有研究主要集中在有监督持续学习，依赖标签和任务边界知识，而标签数据成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用无监督视频Transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，通过核密度估计(KDE)构建非参数概率表示。采用新颖检测标准动态扩展内存集群，并利用之前任务的过移学习作为初始状态。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频动作识别数据集上进行深度评估，无需使用任何标签或类别边界，该方法显著提升了多个任务序列学习的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了一个实用的解决方案，通过非参数方法和动态内存管理有效地处理了视频数据的复杂性和计算挑战。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

*Omer Faruk Durugol,Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于nnU-Net框架的多阶段级联预训练策略，用于胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)的MRI自动分割，通过数据增强方案和训练调度的系统评估，发现不同增强策略在体积精度和边界精度间的权衡，最终采用度量感知的异质集成策略在PANTHER挑战赛中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)的MRI自动分割对临床工作流程至关重要，但受到肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的限制。本文旨在解决PANTHER挑战赛中的诊断性T1加权(Task 1)和治疗性T2加权(Task 2)分割任务。

Method: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上进行微调。通过五折交叉验证系统评估数据增强方案和训练调度，并构建定制化的异质集成模型。

Result: 研究发现激进的数据增强产生最高的体积精度，而默认增强产生最优边界精度(Task 1的MASD达5.46 mm，HD95达17.33 mm)。最终集成策略在交叉验证中达到Task 1肿瘤Dice分数0.661和Task 2的0.523。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学影像任务背景下开发专业化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知的集成策略有效解决了数据增强策略间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出色，在多项选择题测试中准确率达到92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也获得较高评分，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5这一专门针对肿瘤学应用的大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的性能，特别是在放射肿瘤学领域的表现。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤学病例的治疗方案生成。由4名认证放射肿瘤学家评估正确性、全面性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的临床建议仍需专家严格监督，在复杂场景中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

TL;DR: TMUAD是一个三记忆库框架，通过文本记忆库、对象级图像记忆库和补丁级记忆库的统一协作，实现了结构和逻辑异常检测的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕获对象间的逻辑关系，但在逻辑异常检测方面存在局限性，特别是当正常数据有限时。

Method: 提出三记忆库框架：1)类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2)对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3)补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数。

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过协作式记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测，TMUAD框架在多个领域数据集上表现出优异的检测能力，为解决有限正常数据下的异常检测问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够处理视频和多种模态提示（文本、框或掩码），生成时空掩码和对应的物体中心描述，同时解决可提示视频物体分割、指代表达分割和物体描述任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪物体描述进行标注，利用带真实掩码的视频预处理突出感兴趣物体，并输入大型视觉语言模型生成描述。

Result: 在指代表达视频物体分割上达到最先进结果，在半监督视频物体分割上具有竞争力，并为视频物体描述建立了基准。

Conclusion: VoCap模型通过创新的数据标注方法和多任务训练，在多个视频理解任务上表现出色，相关数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉事件识别中动词分类应作为多标签问题考虑，并提出了基于图神经网络和对抗训练的单正根多标签学习方法，在保持单标签指标竞争力的同时显著提升了多标签评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类处理为单标签问题，但这种方式无法处理视觉事件识别中内在的语义模糊性，因为同一张图片可能合理地被多个动词类别描述。

Method: 提出将动词分类重构为单正根多标签学习(SPMLL)问题，设计了Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP)模型，结合图神经网络捕获标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在实际数据集上进行了大量实验，结果显示该方法在保持传统top-1和top-5准确率竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的MAP提升。

Conclusion: 证明了动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型能够有效地处理视觉事件识别中的语义模糊性，为场景识别领域提供了更准确的多标签评估方法。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。需要构建一个能测试各种边缘案例的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的全面测试。通过实验评估现有LLM/MLLM模型的表现，并进行微调实验。

Result: 发现SOTA模型在基础交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点。微调后模型在多个类别上准确率提升，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面。

Conclusion: DriveQA基准测试有效揭示了LLM/MLLM在驾驶知识方面的局限性，通过在该数据集上预训练可以提升下游驾驶任务性能，并证明模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识来有效泛化。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏见数据，有效解决深度学习模型对伪相关的依赖问题，提升模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的伪相关，利用这些非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差。需要一种方法来同时处理多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CoBA（CounterBias Augmentation）框架，在语义三元组层面操作：首先将文本分解为主谓宾三元组，然后选择性修改这些三元组来破坏伪相关，最后从调整后的三元组重构文本来生成反偏见数据。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对伪相关带来的挑战，为提升模型公平性和泛化能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [65] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Percept-V数据集，包含7200张程序生成的图像，用于测试多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现。实验发现，尽管MLLMs在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基础感知任务上的性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在编码、数学和科学等复杂推理任务上取得了显著进展，但在基本视觉感知任务上的表现缺乏系统评估。研究者希望填补这一空白，测试MLLMs在无污染生成图像上的基础感知能力。

Method: 创建Percept-V数据集，包含7200张程序生成的图像，分为30个类别，每个类别测试不同的视觉感知技能组合。使用GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLMs以及OpenAI o4-mini、DeepSeek R1等大型推理模型进行测试评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有测试模型在基础感知任务上的性能都随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。不同模型在不同类别上表现出相似的准确率趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难掌握。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型虽然在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基础视觉感知任务上存在明显不足，特别是在处理复杂度增加的感知问题时表现不佳，这揭示了当前MLLMs在基本感知能力方面的局限性。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在显著标签偏见：Claude标签总能提升评分，Gemini标签总会降低评分，错误标签经常导致排名反转，评分差异最大达50个百分点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地被用于评估输出，需要研究其判断是否会受到模型标签的影响，以确保评估的公平性

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分进行自评估和交叉评估

Result: 发现明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数；错误标签经常逆转排名，偏好投票最大差异50个百分点，质量评分最大差异12个百分点；Gemini在真实标签下自评分崩溃，Claude的自偏好加剧

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Motivation: 提升大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能且自适应地从用户或其他外部来源收集信息

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用从LLM信念分布导出的概率模型，并包含EIG估计器设计、上下文更新策略和候选查询生成等创新

Result: 在20问游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应策略，BED-LLM取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLM提供了一个原则性的框架，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互，在信息收集任务中表现出色

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Conclusion: 领域优化的小型模型能够提供计算效率更高、性能更好的安全分析方案，并支持在资源受限边缘设备上部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来解决自回归语言模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器和嵌入的词汇表外问题

Method: 用基于像素的表示替代基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，提供对噪声输入的更强鲁棒性，并扩展到多语言文本的兼容性

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中评估，证明了其对拼写噪声的弹性和在多语言环境中的有效性

Conclusion: 基于像素的生成语言模型能有效解决文本模型的词汇表外问题，提供更强的鲁棒性和多语言兼容性

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 语音模型在语音获取中未显示明显的关键期效应，反而显示与人类不同的学习模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自盛目语音模型是否也像人类一样存在语言获取的关键期效应，即迟延L2学习开始时间会导膴更大学习困难，而迟延L1学习结束时间会保持更好的母语能力

Method: 训练不同L2开始时间和L1结束时间的自盛目语音模型，使用儿童指向语音进行训练，并评估其音素区分性能

Result: 语音模型没有显示明显的关键期效应：L2学习开始迟的模型在L2上表现更好，L1学习结束迟的模型反而导膴L1遗忘

Conclusion: 自盛目语音模型的语音获取机制与人类存在明显差异，未发现类似于人类语言关键期的现象

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的解码内存管道（DMP）方法，通过识别自我一致性方法中的冗余令牌和选择性推理，在不牺牲AUROC性能的情况下实现了达到3倍的生成速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在实际应用中表现出色，但仍面临虚构问题。现有的虚构检测方法在句子级判断上表现不佳，而自我一致性方法虽能解决这些限制，但需要重复生成导致计算成本较高。

Method: 识别自我一致性方法中的冗余现象（生成中的共享前缀令牌），观察到非准确答案令牌对语义内容贡献最小。基于这些见解，提出了解码内存管道（DMP），通过选择性推理和逆变解码来加速生成。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在不牺牲AUROC性能的情况下实现了达到3倍的速度提升。该方法与模型、数据集、解码策略和自我一致性基线方法都是正交的，且有望扩展到对齐和推理任务。

Conclusion: 解码内存管道（DMP）通过有效减少自我一致性方法中的冗余计算，在保持虚构检测性能的同时显著提升了生成效率，为大语言模型的高效应用提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 本文通过"正常性"概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是普通/平均人类智能而非卓越智能，需要机器像普通人一样犯错。同时指出图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单个法官评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新解读图灵测试的哲学基础，探讨"正常性"概念在图灵测试中的核心作用，挑战当前大语言模型追求卓越智能而非普通智能的研发方向。

Method: 概念分析方法，从统计学和哲学角度分析"正常"的双重含义（规范性和数学性），重新解释图灵测试中"平均人类询问者"的概念。

Result: 提出图灵测试是"正常智能"测试，由"正常法官"（多个法官的平均判断）评估。认为ChatGPT等大语言模型追求的是人工聪明而非真正的人工智能。

Conclusion: 图灵测试能否贡献对人类认知的理解，取决于人类心智是否真的可简化为平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身，质疑了其所依赖的正常主义范式的概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Motivation: 针对自动文本摘要评估领域存在的可复现性挑战，研究者希望系统分析不同评估指标的实际表现差异，特别是新兴LLM评估方法与传统方法的对比。

Method: 构建统一的开源评估框架，在SummEval数据集上对六种代表性指标（包括ROUGE等经典方法和G-Eval、SEval-Ex等LLM方法）进行系统性实验比较。

Result: 发现评估指标表现与文献报告存在显著差异；与人类判断最一致的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性较差；LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和可复现性限制等问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽的文档记录和方法论标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的可靠性，同时需要平衡评估效果与计算成本之间的关系。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Method: 开发了一个全自动的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下测试各种ARG方法检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力。

Result: 研究发现，与预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对ARG生成的审稿意见没有显著影响，表明当前模型在这项关键审稿技能上存在局限。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出了三项可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估医学奖励模型和评判器的基准Med-RewardBench，包含1026个专家标注的多模态医学案例，涵盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在6个关键临床维度上评估32个最先进的多模态大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注通用多模态大语言模型能力或作为求解器评估，缺乏针对医学场景中诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度的专门评估基准，医学奖励模型和评判器研究不足。

Method: 构建包含1026个专家标注案例的多模态数据集，采用严格的三步流程确保高质量评估数据，涵盖6个临床关键维度，评估32个先进模型并开发基线模型进行微调改进。

Result: 评估发现现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面存在显著挑战，开发的基线模型通过微调实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为医学多模态大语言模型的可靠评估提供了重要基准，展示了微调对性能改进的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，从大语言模型的词嵌入中分解出多个子嵌入，识别可解释的语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法往往依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示语义组织更细致结构的新方法。

Method: 提出DCSRM模型，将词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个编码特定语义信息；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解的关键因素；神经相关性验证了子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，为理解语言和大脑中意义组织的核心维度提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [81] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出"意识形态深度"概念来衡量LLMs内部政治表征的稳健性和复杂性，通过可操纵性测试和稀疏自编码器分析发现不同模型具有显著差异的意识形态特征分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些立场的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。表面响应容易被提示工程操控，需要探究其是否反映连贯的底层意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活导向测量开源LLMs的可操纵性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征。

Result: 发现可操纵性较低的模型具有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，其中一个模型比同规模模型多7.3倍政治特征。对核心政治特征进行定向消融会导致深度模型产生一致逻辑推理转变，而浅层模型仅增加拒绝输出。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs的可量化属性，可操纵性为研究其潜在政治架构提供了重要窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略，通过RLAIF框架提升7B参数小语言模型的中文问候语创意写作能力，其中基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型计算需求高，小语言模型在创意写作方面存在局限性，现有方法如SFT缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 采用RLAIF框架，探索两种AI奖励策略：1）使用多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2）基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法，通过对抗训练和反思机制优化奖励函数。

Result: 两种方法均显著提升创意输出质量，但基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优，自动化评估与人工判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，在减少人工标注依赖的同时保持高质量输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次聚类的自动分类器选择方法，通过优先考虑多样性来改进集成学习在假新闻检测中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集成学习方法在假新闻检测中性能严重依赖于分类器的多样性，但选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战，因为模型往往学习冗余模式

Method: 首先计算分类器间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将它们组织成不同粒度的组，然后通过HierarchySelect探索层次级别来选择每个级别的分类器池，最后选择最具多样性的池用于集成构建，并融入性能评估指标

Result: 在6个数据集中的2个上达到了最高准确率，优于Elbow启发式方法和现有最先进基线

Conclusion: 该方法通过优先考虑多样性并融入性能评估，有效提高了集成学习在假新闻检测中的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity
tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations,
targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings. The

Abstract: The proliferation of textual data containing sensitive personal information
across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect
privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for
diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization
techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered

evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent
challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to
address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择和数据合成方法存在静态数据集构建的局限性，无法适应模型能力的动态演化，需要建立闭环优化系统

Method: 三轴模型信号诊断（损失模式、嵌入聚类动态、自对齐分数）+自适应优化引擎+动态学习原则的闭环优化

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同进化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Method: 将32名参与者按Keirsey人格类型均匀分配，在数据分析、创意写作、信息检索和写作辅助四个任务中评估GPT-4和Claude 3.5的交互

Result: 理性型强烈偏好GPT-4（尤其目标导向任务），理想型偏好Claude 3.5（尤其创意和分析任务），其他人格类型偏好依任务而异，情感分析确认了这些模式

Conclusion: 人格基础的分析能够揭示传统评估方法没有发现的LLM差异，总体有用性评分相似但个人偏好存在显著差异

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are

Conclusion: 作者发布了Misviz、Misviz-synth数据集及相关代码，为后续研究提供了重要资源，有助于保护读者免受误导性可视化影响并减少错误信息传播。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在多任务场景下存在"跷跷板现象"，即某些任务性能提升以其他任务性能下降为代价，需要解决任务干扰和遗忘问题

Method: 1) 独立微调识别各任务核心参数区域 2) 基于区域重叠的任务聚类 3) 核心参数直接移植+非核心参数SLERP融合 4) 轻量级流水线SFT训练，冻结先前任务核心区域

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著缓解任务干扰和遗忘，持续优于普通多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过参数隔离和智能融合有效解决了多任务微调中的关键挑战，为LLM适配下游任务提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了MENTAT方法，通过批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在推理密集型回归任务上比冻结LLM提示和Transformer微调基线提升高达65%


<details>

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在推理密集型回归任务（如从文本中推导数值属性）中的性能不足问题，这类任务需要深度文本分析但训练数据和计算资源有限

Method: MENTAT方法结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，通过优化提示和集成多个模型来提升性能

Result: 在三个现实问题构建的基准测试中，MENTAT相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer微调基线取得了高达65%的性能提升

Conclusion: MENTAT为推理密集型回归任务提供了有效的解决方案，但该领域仍有很大的改进空间，需要未来的进一步研究

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的采样方法，通过联合对数似然评分选择最佳推理链，在数学推理任务上显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-n采样需要设计有效的评分函数来识别正确的推理链，而无需真实答案作为参考

Method: 使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然作为评分函数，自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度

Result: 在MATH500上提升10.18分，AIME2025上提升9.81分，在20次比较中16次以至少2倍少的样本超越基线

Conclusion: 正确的推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络爬取数据存在质量、安全和伦理问题，但之前的研究受计算限制只能分析小样本，需要更好的工具来分析大规模LLM训练数据

Method: 构建基于ElasticSearch的索引和分析流水线，应用于1.5TB的多语言FineWeb-2语料库

Result: 实现了快速查询性能（大多数搜索在毫秒内完成，全部在2秒内），展示了实时数据集分析能力

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更安全、更负责任的AI系统提供了实用工具，能够有效分析大规模LLM训练数据集的质量问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合字符串相似度、主题建模、层次聚类和基于规则的流水线方法，用于聚类银行支付系统中的交易对手方，解决了自然语言模型不适用于短文本聚类的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用混合方法：字符串相似度计算、主题建模、层次聚类和基于规则的流水线，支持未知聚类数量的情况，并设计了基于精确率和召回率的评估指标。

Result: 在真实标注数据集上的测试显示，相比基于规则的基线方法性能显著提升，保持了规则系统的可解释性，同时减少了人工审核需求。

Conclusion: 该方法有效填补了反欺诈专业人员工具集的空白，在制裁调查等场景中能更好地控制遗漏实体变体的风险，提高了支付流分析的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医疗AI主要关注预测结果，而强化学习能够主动制定干预决策并优化长期目标，这代表了医疗人工智能向代理智能的根本性转变，需要系统性地探索其潜力与风险。

Method: 论文采用综述研究方法，首先构建RL技术体系（包括基于模型/无模型方法、离线学习等），然后全面分析在重症监护、慢性病、心理健康等领域的应用，并批判性分析伦理和部署挑战。

Result: 研究系统梳理了RL在医疗保健的多源信息融合机制、不同架构部署方式，识别了各应用领域的趋势、差距和转化瓶颈，并提出了安全、人本对齐的策略学习经验。

Conclusion: 强化学习不仅是工具集合，更是向临床环境中代理智能的范式转变，需要同时关注技术路线和伦理反思，确保其作为代理临床智能而非单纯预测机器的安全部署。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多粒度EEG情绪分类框架，在GAMEEMO数据集上使用LSTM-GRU模型在二元效价分类中达到0.932 F1分数，在多类和多标签分类中分别达到94.5%和90.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情绪识别研究大多局限于二元效价预测或特定被试分类，限制了在真实情感计算系统中的泛化能力和部署应用。

Method: 采用结构化预处理策略（时间窗口分割、混合统计和频域特征提取、z-score标准化），构建多粒度情绪标签（二元效价、多类分类、多标签表示），评估多种机器学习模型和深度学习架构。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型表现最佳，在二元效价任务中F1分数达0.932，在多类和多标签情绪分类中分别达到94.5%和90.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的多粒度EEG情绪分类框架在GAMEEMO数据集上表现出色，LSTM-GRU模型在各种情绪分类任务中均取得最优性能，为真实情感计算系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

TL;DR: PVPO是一种高效的强化学习方法，通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样来解决无评论家方法中的局部最优和高计算成本问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无评论家强化学习方法（特别是群体策略）严重依赖策略内的多重采样和比较来估计优势，这容易导致策略陷入局部最优并增加计算成本

Method: 使用参考模型提前进行rollout计算奖励分数作为参考锚点，有效纠正组内比较引入的累积偏差；在数据预采样中通过参考模型评估样本难度，选择高增益数据提高训练效率

Result: 在9个数据集和2个领域上的实验表明，PVPO达到了最先进的性能，在多个任务上展现出强大的泛化能力，并在不同规模的模型上表现出可扩展的性能

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样机制，显著减少了对rollout次数的依赖，提高了训练效率，同时避免了局部最优问题

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法（如Adagrad）使用对角预处理矩阵，无法捕捉参数相关性；全矩阵自适应方法虽然能建模相关性但计算和内存成本过高

Method: 采用快速对称分解计算预处理更新方向，使用矩阵积分器方法保持预处理器的低秩结构，支持秩五及更小的秩近似

Result: 数值实验表明AdaGram在标准机器学习任务上比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当

Conclusion: AdaGram为大规模模型中的自适应优化提供了一个可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法假设完整的查询-LLM映射知识，但实际应用中缺乏这种全面信息且查询在不断演化，需要更动态的解决方案。

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间，初始化为离线人类偏好数据，通过线上机器反馈精炼。提出PILOT算法（LinUCB扩展），并为不同预算模式化为多选择背包问题。

Result: 该方法能够在不需要对所有查询进行全部LLM推理的情况下，通过机器反馈实现自适应性路由决策，同时满足资源限制要求。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由形式化为上下文机器问题，通过PILOT算法和成本政策，提供了一种可适应实际应用场景中缺乏完整标签数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Conclusion: MoE框架通过协同整合专业架构的互补优势，为创建更鲁棒准确的复合代理模型提供了有效策略

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为合成数据发布的隐私审计工具非常有效，突显了生成模型过度拟合在现实应用中带来的重大隐私风险

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 通过层次化残差结构可以显著提升未训练循环神经网络的记忆能力和长期时序建模性能，为时间序列处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

### [106] [Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186)
*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将大语言模型中的解码过程形式化为概率单纯形上的约束变分原理，证明了在固定上下文和温度下，下一个token分布会沿着光滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为大型语言模型中的解码过程提供严格的数学框架，形式化常见的"流形遍历"直觉，并推导出面向实践的具体结论

Method: 使用约束变分原理分析解码过程，将离散的归一化上升描述为乘法权重（熵镜像）更新，连续时间极限为复制子流，建立数学证明框架

Result: 证明了next-token分布在单纯形内沿光滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡；温度精确地重新缩放时间；top-k和nucleus采样将流限制在具有相同保证的面上

Conclusion: 为LLM解码提供了严格的数学基础，形式化了输出分布级别的流形遍历直觉，并推导出温度、采样方法等实践参数的确切作用机制

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

### [107] [Model-Task Alignment Drives Distinct RL Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21188)
*Haoze Wu,Cheng Wang,Wenshuo Zhao,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型强化学习中的反直觉现象（如单样本训练效果、不精确奖励信号、负样本训练等）只在模型与任务高度对齐时有效，在更具挑战性的场景中标准RL方法仍更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近大语言模型强化学习中出现了一系列反直觉现象，但这些现象的有效条件和失败场景尚不明确，需要系统研究其背后的关键因素。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域中检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注模型-任务对齐程度（用pass@k准确率衡量）的影响。

Result: 研究表明，许多反直觉结果仅在模型与任务已高度对齐时出现，而在更具挑战性的场景中这些技术无法驱动实质性学习，标准RL方法仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐程度是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，标准RL训练在各种设置中保持一致性，而反直觉现象只在特定对齐条件下有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

*Pujan Thapa,Alexander Ororbia,Travis Desell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于自组织地图(SOM)和变分自动编码器(VAE)的新题持续学习框架，通过生成式回放实现内存效率优化，无需存储原始数据或任务标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中的效果恒定性问题，避免存储大量原始数据所带来的内存消耗和隐私风险，提供一种可视化且内存效率高的解决方案。

Method: 采用SOM与VAE结合的方法：高维数据在VAE潜在空间进行SOM进行生成，低维数据直接使用SOM。为每个SOM单元存储运行均值、方差咈协方差矩阵，从中生成合成样本用于后续回放学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100标准类增量测试中，方法表现竞争力强，比最佳单类增量方法分别提高10%和7%。同时超越了无内存方法，具有良好的可扩展性、任务标签免需和内存效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为持续学习提供了一种可扩展、高效且可视化的生成式回放方案，在保持竞争性能的同时大幅减少内存需求，具有应用前景。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) 是一种新的机制可解释性方法，使用层间相关性传播(LRP)系数替代梯度，在保持计算效率的同时比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活修补是机制可解释性中定位模型组件的重要方法，但计算成本高；属性修补虽然更快但存在噪声和可靠性问题，特别是在深度非线性网络中。

Method: 引入Relevance Patching (RelP)，用LRP的传播系数替代属性修补中的局部梯度，只需要两次前向传播和一次反向传播，保持计算效率。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上验证，RelP比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补，特别是在GPT-2 Large的IOI任务中，MLP输出的Pearson相关性从0.006提升到0.956。

Conclusion: RelP在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了对激活修补的近似准确性，为大规模机制可解释性分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机梯度下降是训练PINNs的常用方法，但其收敛性保证对实际应用至关重要，现有研究主要分析梯度下降，需要扩展到随机优化方法

Method: 分析过参数化两层PINNs在随机梯度下降/流训练过程中的动态，确保Gram矩阵的正定性，处理随机优化引入的动态随机性

Result: 建立了随机梯度下降/流在高概率意义下的线性收敛性，适用于一般类激活函数

Conclusion: 该分析为随机算法训练的神经网络提供了理论保证，深入揭示了优化过程的动态特性

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

TL;DR: FedOwen是一个高效的联邦学习框架，使用Owen采样来近似Shapley值，在相同评估预算下比现有方法误差更小，并通过自适应客户端选择策略实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确估计客户端贡献对于公平奖励和选择最有用的客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度呈指数增长，不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样的客户端。

Result: 在固定评估成本下，FedOwen在相同通信轮数内比最先进的基线方法在非IID基准测试中达到高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，显著提高了联邦学习的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guess-and-Learn (G&L) v1.0是一个评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的框架，通过测量模型从未标记数据集中顺序学习时累积的错误数量，揭示传统终点精度评估忽略的早期学习成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估过于关注最终精度，忽略了模型从零开始学习过程中的累积错误成本（适应成本）。G&L旨在填补这一空白，量化模型在冷启动情况下的实际学习效率。

Method: G&L定义了四种实验轨道（从头训练/预训练 × 在线/批量更新），通过让学习器逐步选择实例、预测标签、接收真实标签并更新参数的方式，测量错误轨迹。使用MNIST和AG News数据集测试了感知机、k-NN、CNN、ResNet-50、ViT-B/16和BERT-base等多种模型。

Result: 实验显示小模型在早期阶段能以更少错误适应，预训练效果因领域而异。所有当前模型都远高于理论最优的"oracle参考带"，表明存在显著的适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准测试，为开发不仅最终准确而且从一开始就可靠的学习器提供了可复现的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

TL;DR: CALM框架：基于Apache Beam和TimesFm的实时异常检测系统，通过持续微调和LLM判断机制应对概念漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的异常检测模型在面对数据统计特性随时间变化（概念漂移）时性能显著下降，需要开发能够实时适应的解决方案

Method: 构建基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架的端到端系统，使用TimesFm基础模型进行预测式异常检测，采用闭环持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练基础模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流式环境中有效维持高性能异常检测能力

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Motivation: 肌电信号固有的非平稳性使得域偏移检测具有挑战性，需要开发有效的实时检测方法来维持稳定的肌电解码模型。

Method: 使用KPCA（余弦核）预处理Ninapro数据库的DB6数据集，评估CUSUM、Page-Hinckley和ADWIN等多種漂移检测方法。

Result: 现有漂移检测技术在肌电信号实时域偏移检测中表现不佳，性能有限。

Conclusion: 流式学习方法在维持肌电解码模型稳定性方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来提高鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法依赖存储历史样本或复杂正则化，面临数据隐私、存储限制和任务差异导致的性能下降等挑战。

Method: 采用'觉醒-睡眠'双阶段：觉醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑生成模型；睡眠阶段利用所有生成模型生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉(Split-MNIST)和自然语言处理(Split-AG News)基准测试中，MyGO显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，保持了跨任务的高平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架无需存储原始数据，仅保留紧凑生成模型，在隐私保护和存储效率方面具有显著优势，证明了其有效性和领域通用性。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

TL;DR: VILA是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过改进FILA方法的Fisher信息假设，实现了更准确的参数识别和更高的计算效率，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs无意生成敏感信息的问题，传统重训练方法计算成本过高，现有FILA方法虽然参数高效但仍需访问全部参数且Fisher信息估计不准确。

Method: 提出VILA框架，显式考虑FILA忽略的Fisher信息基本假设，提高遗忘集参数识别准确性；无需访问完整模型参数，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 相比FILA实现100倍参数效率和40倍训练速度提升，在TOFU、WMDP、MUSE等基准测试中达到新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进Fisher信息假设和减少参数访问需求，为机器遗忘提供了更高效准确的解决方案，在计算效率和性能方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析实际Q学习算法收敛性的理论框架，针对使用代理状态（非信念状态）和策略正则化的Q学习变体，证明了其在温和条件下收敛到正则化MDP的固定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际Q学习算法通常使用代理状态（如RNN状态）而非信念状态，并采用策略正则化来促进探索和稳定学习，但这类算法的理论收敛性缺乏系统分析。

Method: 研究最简单的正则化代理状态Q学习（RASQL）算法，分析其在温和技术条件下的收敛性，证明其收敛到由行为策略平稳分布定义的正则化MDP固定点。

Result: 理论证明RASQL收敛到正则化MDP的固定点，该结果也适用于学习周期策略的RASQL变体，数值实验验证了理论与经验收敛的一致性。

Conclusion: 为实际Q学习算法的收敛性提供了理论保证，证明了使用代理状态和策略正则化的算法在适当条件下能够收敛，填补了理论分析与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器，通过采样方法平衡全局一致性和细粒度重建，解决了BatchTopK中的"激活彩票"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的TopK SAE在处理不同信息量的token时效率低下，BatchTopK虽然提高了平均重建质量但存在"激活彩票"问题，即罕见的高幅度特征会挤掉更有信息量但幅度较低的特征。

Method: 提出Sampled-SAE方法：对批次激活矩阵的列（特征）进行评分（通过L2范数或熵），形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后应用Top-K从受限的特征池中选择token。通过调整l参数在批次级和token特定选择之间进行权衡。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型上的实验表明，没有单一的l值能在所有指标上达到最优，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调、分布感知的方法家族，提供了在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，能够有效解决时间序列合成中的时间依赖性和特征捕捉问题

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: AHTSGD是首个基于Edge of Stability现象调整优化器注入噪声特性的算法，能够有效促进宽盆地收敛，提高模型泛化性能，且对学习率选择具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Motivation: 研究神经网络是否通过平滑渐进的方式构建表示，还是涉及更复杂的计算过程，通过分析超人类象棋引擎的策略网络来探索这一问题。

Method: 扩展logit lens方法，分析Leela Chess Zero策略网络各层的表现，评估下棋强度和解题能力的变化趋势。

Result: 发现虽然下棋强度和解题能力呈现强单调趋势，但策略分布经常遵循非平滑轨迹，包括早期发现但随后丢弃的正确解、与最终输出相关性差的走法排名，以及直到网络后期仍存在的高策略分歧。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示构建过程可能比语言模型中观察到的平滑分布收敛更加复杂和非平滑，揭示了不同任务中神经网络计算过程的差异性。

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and

components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different

settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Result: 在标准基准测试上的实验表明，CoM实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: CoM方法有效缓解了由协变量偏移引起的性能退化，为模型合并提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合传统期望累积奖励和时间平均增长率的新型强化学习算法，通过几何平均和滑动窗口估计器来优化个体轨迹的长期性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RL算法优化期望累积奖励，但实际部署时个体轨迹性能更重要。期望值是对无限轨迹的平均，无法反映单个轨迹的真实表现。

Method: 定义了时间平均增长率的Bellman算子，在乘法奖励动态下使用几何平均，对更一般的奖励动态提出带N滑动窗口的修正几何平均估计器，并将其作为正则化项嵌入目标函数。

Result: 在具有挑战性的仿真环境中，该算法优于传统RL方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能同时受益于集合平均和时间平均，有效提升个体轨迹的长期性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Conclusion: Rm-NML为黎曼流形上的模型选择和遗憾最小化提供了几何结构感知的解决方案，特别适用于双曲空间等具有层次结构的数据分析。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on

importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

### [134] [On the Hardness of Learning GNN-based SAT Solvers: The Role of Graph Ricci Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21513)
*Geri Skenderi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过图里奇曲率分析发现，随机k-SAT公式生成的二分图具有负曲率特性，且难度越大曲率越小。这导致GNN求解器出现过度压缩问题，无法有效处理长程依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在求解布尔可满足性问题时，面对困难实例性能急剧下降，需要探究这是否源于架构的根本局限性。

Method: 使用图里奇曲率理论分析SAT公式的图表示，证明随机k-SAT公式的二分图具有负曲率特性，并通过实验验证曲率与问题难度的相关性。

Result: 发现曲率是问题复杂度的强指标，可预测GNN性能。负曲率导致GNN出现过度压缩现象，限制了长程依赖信息的传递。

Conclusion: 研究结果为现有求解器的设计原则提供了理论解释，并指出了未来改进GNN求解器的重要方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

*Jens Leysen,Marco Favier,Bart Goethals*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在推荐系统中实现隐式反馈数据最小化的可行性，证明技术上可以大幅减少数据而不影响性能，但实际应用受到技术设置和用户特征的刻刻制约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据最小化是个人数据处理的法律原则，但在依赖大量个人数据的推荐系统中运作化这一原则仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 提出新题问形式化，分析各种最小化技术，并研究影响其有效性的关键因素。

Result: 证明在不导致显著性能损失的情况下，大幅减少推理数据在技术上是可行的。

Conclusion: 虽然技术上可行，但数据最小化在实践中仍面临挑战，其对技术和用户上下文的依赖性使得定义通用的数据"必需性"标准很困难。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Motivation: 传统ECG设备存在噪声和运动伪影问题，且缺乏对不同性别解剖生理差异的考虑，需要开发更适合实际使用场景的纺织服装式ECG监测设备。

Method: 采用新型纺织服装设计，创新电极布局；对15名男性和15名女性进行多维度评估：信号质量指数、生理参数分析、机器学习分类、心电图形态分析、电极角度影响研究，并在不同活动阶段进行测试。

Result: 纺织系统在节律和形态分析中与参考设备高度一致，表现出稳健的分类性能，能够识别影响信号采集的关键性别特异性决定因素。

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

TL;DR: PINNs在智能电网建模中通过整合物理定律，相比传统数据驱动方法在泛化能力和物理一致性方面表现更优，特别是在动态电网操作中误差更低且能可靠捕捉状态转换。


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统数据驱动方法在智能电网建模中的数据稀缺和物理一致性不足的问题，探索物理信息神经网络作为替代模型的潜力。

Method: 使用基于物理的损失函数训练PINNs（强制功率平衡、操作约束和电网稳定性），并与XGBoost、随机森林和线性回归在插值、交叉验证和轨迹预测三个实验中进行比较。

Result: PINNs展现出优越的泛化能力，在误差减少方面优于数据驱动模型，在动态电网操作中保持较低的MAE，并能可靠捕捉状态转换，而传统模型表现不稳定。

Conclusion: PINNs作为智能电网替代模型的范式转变工具，将数据驱动的灵活性与第一性原理的严谨性相结合，对安全关键应用至关重要，推动了实时电网控制和可扩展数字孪生的发展。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Conclusion: OASIS框架旨在解决海洋盐度测量中的挑战，为稀疏、不规则和噪声数据提供新的解决方案

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Motivation: 研究情感和时间特征如何预测社交媒体上的用户互动（点赞和评论）

Method: 使用HistGradientBoostingRegressor多目标回归模型，基于价值、舌动和情感指标进行预测，并对偏斜的目标变量进行对数变换

Result: 模型在点赞预测上表现优异（R²=0.98），但在评论预测上表现一般（R²=0.41），显示评论受其他因素影响

Conclusion: 情感和曝光信号能有效预测点赞，但预测评论需要更多特征来控制其他影响因素

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

<details>

Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，特别是在不同分布偏移程度下的检测挑战

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为对分类输出贡献最大的关键子空间和贡献最小的次要子空间。在远分布偏移时利用次要子空间特征，在近分布偏移时使用关键子空间特征

Result: 在各种标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过分析分类头权重的奇异值分解，可以识别出对分类任务敏感程度不同的特征子空间，针对不同分布偏移程度采用相应的子空间特征，能显著提升OOD检测性能

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: 断点预测为估计未来或假设事件对特定社区的异质性影响提供了新可能性

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架，支持在FPGA上部署实时ML推理模型，模型权重可动态更新无需重新合成；并开发Auto-SNL Python扩展，自动将Python神经网络模型转换为SNL兼容的高级合成代码。

Result: 在Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA上进行基准测试，与最先进工具hls4ml对比，SNL在大多数神经网络架构中实现竞争性或更优的延迟性能，某些情况下还能节省FPGA资源。

Conclusion: SNL展示了其多功能性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等领域的研究人员和学者开辟了新的机会，解决了高速实验环境中的实时数据处理挑战。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

Motivation: 现有的多标签排序方法只利用标签的二分类信息（正/负），没有充分利用正标签之间的排序信息，无法捕捉类别的重要性和相关性差异。

Method: 提出UniMLR框架，通过正标签的排序来建模隐式的类别相关性概率分布，并创建了8个合成数据集（Ranked MNISTs）来解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题。

Conclusion: UniMLR通过利用正标签排序信息，为多标签排序提供了新的范式，能够更好地建模类别相关性，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Motivation: 解决心率预测中的数据异质性问题，包括来自不同设备的源异质性和不同用户的生理差异性，现有方法无法同时处理这两种异质性。

Method: 提出了一个框架，使用随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性，采用时间感知注意力模块和对比学习目标来处理用户异质性，学习不受两种异质性影响的潜在表征。

Conclusion: 该框架有效地处理了心率预测中的数据异质性问题，在实际数据集上表现优异，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

*Jessica Liang,Anirudh Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种参数高效的微调方法，通过QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基，仅训练标量系数，大幅减少可训练参数数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA变体使用SVD初始化更新矩阵，但SVD在大模型上计算昂贵且奇异向量难以解释，需要更高效和结构化的方法

Method: 使用带列旋转的QR分解从预训练权重矩阵中提取正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA仅用601个参数就能达到或超过全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA的性能，参数量减少1000倍以上

Conclusion: QR-LoRA提供了一种参数效率极高且性能优越的微调方法，为大型语言模型的高效适应提供了新思路

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: FLIP是一个基于Transformer的变分自编码器，结合潜在扩散模型生成异构表格数据，在差分隐私保护下同时解决隐私和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI责任框架的实施，真实数据的使用面临更多限制。合成数据生成成为风险感知数据共享和模型开发的有前景解决方案，特别是在医疗等敏感领域的表格数据应用中。

Method: 使用Transformer-based变分自编码器增强潜在扩散生成异构表格数据；采用Rényi差分隐私约束训练；在输入空间通过RDP兼容的平衡采样处理公平性；在潜在空间使用Centered Kernel Alignment对齐不同保护组的神经元激活模式。

Result: 实证结果表明，FLIP在差分隐私约束下，能够有效提供显著的任务无关公平性改进，并在多样化下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: FLIP方法在保护隐私的同时有效提升了数据公平性，为任务无关的公平数据生成提供了可行的解决方案，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了架构归纳偏置如何影响大语言模型在指导性对话中的认知行为，通过引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式来促进苏格拉底式辅导中的结构化推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在教学对话中的认知行为，旨在通过结构化机制提升模型的教学能力。

Method: 使用符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的受控消融实验，采用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，并使用基于LLM的评估框架进行系统比较。

Result: 完整系统在所有基线变体中表现最佳，移除记忆或符号结构会显著降低关键认知行为（抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性）。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明结构化机制对提升模型教学能力的重要性。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO是一个LLM增强的集成本体学习框架，通过同时利用多个医学本体图，在异构本体系统内和跨系统进行双轴知识传播，以增强医学概念表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要关注单一本体系统或多个孤立本体系统的领域知识整合，缺乏统一的学习结构，导致概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系，忽略了跨本体连接。

Method: 1) 使用LLM通过包含概念描述和本体上下文的工程化提示提供图检索增强的初始化；2) 通过双轴知识传播联合学习不同本体图中的医学概念：本体内部垂直传播和本体间水平传播；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了LINKO相对于最先进基线的优越性能，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架通过整合多个本体系统和LLM增强的初始化，有效提升了医学概念表示学习的效果，特别是在数据稀缺情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

TL;DR: TiG框架通过将强化学习决策重新构建为语言建模任务，让大语言模型在游戏环境中直接交互，有效弥合陈述性知识与程序性知识之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但在简单交互任务中表现不佳，这揭示了陈述性知识（知道什么）与程序性知识（知道如何做）之间的关键差距。

Method: TiG框架将基于强化学习的决策重新构建为语言建模任务：LLMs生成语言引导的策略，通过基于环境反馈的在线强化学习进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验结果显示TiG成功弥合了陈述性知识与程序性知识的差距，相比传统RL方法以显著更低的数据和计算需求实现了竞争性性能，并提供逐步自然语言解释。

Conclusion: TiG框架有效解决了LLMs在交互环境中的决策能力不足问题，同时保持了其推理和解释能力，大大提高了复杂交互任务的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM是一个全面的音频-语言模型基准测试，整合了多个数据集来评估10个重要方面，包括音频感知、知识、推理、情感检测、偏见、公平性、多语言性、鲁棒性、毒性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且不同评估使用不同的提示方法和推理参数，导致模型比较困难。

Method: 开发AHELM基准，整合各种数据集（包括2个新的合成音频-文本数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，测试14个开放权重和闭源API的ALM模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第5。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面的标准化基准来评估音频-语言模型，揭示了当前模型的优势和不足，特别是公平性问题，并展示了简单基线系统的竞争力。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Conclusion: 该研究将著名的和新颖的遗忘操作提升到认知层面，为认知状态中的遗忘操作提供了系统的理论框架和评估方法，丰富了知识管理中遗忘操作的研究视角。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，观察到的状态往往不完整（缺少某些谓词），动作也不显示所有参数，现有方法大多假设完整STRIPS状态和动作，需要更现实的设置。

Method: 提出STRIPS+变体，允许隐式动作参数和有限存在量化，开发SYNTH算法通过构建分层前提条件表达式来学习STRIPS+模型。

Result: 建立了SYNTH算法的正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS领域衍生的STRIPS+模型轨迹上测试了可扩展性。

Conclusion: STRIPS+框架和SYNTH算法能够有效学习不完整状态和部分参数动作的模型，为现实场景下的模型学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个新的多模态搜索基准测试，包含311个需要深度视觉推理的任务，旨在解决现有基准测试中浅层工作流的问题，要求模型进行细粒度视觉理解、来源验证和长时程工具使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流解决，依赖于高召回率的图像搜索和邻近文本，无法真正测试多模态理解的挑战。需要一个新的基准来评估模型在细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用方面的能力。

Method: 采用空间-时间外推法构建任务，每个任务包含多个弱局部视觉信号，需要通过迭代的文本-图像搜索进行提取和传播，并在检索噪声下进行交叉验证。提供了一个模型无关的代理框架，包含浏览工具来评估各种闭源和开源MLLM。

Result: 最强代理(o3)在没有搜索的情况下达到15.1%准确率，在框架下通过搜索达到36.0%准确率。最强的开源模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct)在没有搜索时准确率为0.0%，经过20轮搜索后达到6.9%。

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus基准测试揭示了当前MLLM在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的显著不足，为多模态网络代理的发展提供了重要的评估标准。

genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模糊Z数的智慧推理计算框架，将智慧量化为多维度和置信度双属性表示，通过道德困境任务验证了其有效性和区分效度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智慧测量依赖自报告，无法体现智慧固有的谦逊和不确定性特征，需要开发能同时考虑多维性和置信度的计算框架来改进心理学测量并实现人性化AI

Method: 使用模糊推理系统和Z数（智慧分数+置信分数），通过文化中立的图画道德困境任务收集100名参与者的口语反应，映射到5个智慧成分，基于21条规则组合分数，使用高斯核密度估计调整隶属函数

Result: 概念验证研究表明，系统产生的双属性智慧表示与既有量表存在适度但显著的相关性，与无关特质关系可忽略，支持了收敛效度和区分效度

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为多维、不确定性感知的构念，通过Z数操作化，不仅推进了心理学测量，还为AI系统提供了可解释、置信度敏感的安全推理方法

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反事实场景的新型解释范式，用于自动规划领域，通过最小化修改规划问题来生成满足特定属性要求的计划解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反事实解释仅关注对现有计划的最小修改，但无法捕捉问题的高层特性。需要一种能够解释规划问题本身特性的方法。

Method: 提出基于反事实场景的解释范式，给定规划问题P和LTLf公式ψ，识别对P的最小修改使得其能够产生满足ψ的计划。提出了两种基于显式量化的定性实例化方法。

Result: 分析了不同类型修改下生成反事实场景的计算复杂度，证明其通常与计算P的计划成本相当，具有实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建实用算法提供了基础，能够有效解释规划问题的高层特性，且计算成本可控。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个基于GenAI的框架，通过集成多个大型语言模型来自动解释过程挖掘结果并生成报告，简化了医疗领域过程挖掘的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在医疗工作流分析中具有强大潜力，但面临技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法和实践培训资源有限等障碍，需要更易用的解决方案。

Method: 开发了HealthProcessAI框架，作为PM4PY(Python)和bupaR(R)库的封装器，集成多个LLM模型进行自动化过程图解释和报告生成，使用脓毒症进展数据进行概念验证。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景的脓毒症数据，技术性能稳健。LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性评分(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动解释，为将复杂过程挖掘结果转化为医疗应用的可操作见解提供了新颖的方法学进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨领域自动发现通用地标的新框架，通过学习已解决实例来生成中间目标，用于传统地标提取算法难以处理的规划问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地标提取算法在处理某些规划问题时表现不足，需要能够自动泛化到整个领域的地标发现方法，这些地标应能描述中间目标并捕捉重复模式

Method: 使用独立于特定问题对象的状态函数构建有向通用地标图，包括重复子计划的循环可能性，并基于此图开发启发式算法来解决新问题实例

Result: 结果显示，从少量小实例学习到的通用地标图对同一领域中更大规模的实例同样有效，当识别到重复循环时，启发式性能相比基线有显著提升

Conclusion: 通用地标能够捕捉可解释且对自动化规划器有用的领域信息，这些信息可以从同一领域的少量计划中发现，为规划问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Motivation: 现有Dec-POMDP解法在处理大规模确定性多自主规划问题时效率低下，需要专门优化的法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出IDPP（Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning）方法，基于联合均衡搜索框架，专门优化处理大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs。

Result: IDPP方法能够高效处理当前Dec-POMDP解法无法有效解决的大规模确定性多自主规划问题。

Conclusion: 确定性Det-Dec-POMDPs模型和IDPP解法为大规模多机器人导航等确定性多自主规划问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数来加速搜索，但它是单次算法，无法随时间改进解的质量，需要仔细设置膨胀因子。

Method: 受ARA*算法启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发了随时版本A-MHA*，保持原有的次优性和完备性保证。

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域的实验表明，A-MHA*相比MHA*和其他随时算法具有更好的性能。

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功将MHA*扩展为随时算法，能够在保持理论保证的同时持续改进解质量，在实际问题中表现优异。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY框架通过保留多个AI模型的多样性输出而非追求共识，将偏见视为潜在优势，将幻觉作为临床验证的假设，为医疗AI系统提供新的发展路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为医疗AI中的偏见是需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含教育、文化和经验塑造的偏见，这些偏见可能不可避免且具有价值。

Method: 开发MEDLEY概念框架，协调多个AI模型并保留其多样性输出，使用30多个大型语言模型构建概念验证演示器，在合成病例中同时保留共识和少数观点。

Result: 概念验证演示器成功实现了诊断不确定性和潜在偏见的透明化，使临床监督能够看到模型的多样性输出。

Conclusion: 通过将AI不完美性重新定义为资源，MEDLEY提供了范式转变，为开发可信赖的医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了科学文档的层次结构和文本视觉元素的语义整合，需要同时解决这两个挑战。

Method: 引入Poster Tree分层中间表示，采用多智能体协作策略（内容摘要和布局规划智能体），通过迭代协调和相互反馈实现联合优化。

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验中，该方法在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好方面表现优异，为科学海报自动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于旅行商问题的变分量子算法，结合紧凑排列编码和优化-冻结-重用策略，在中等规模问题上实现了高成功率并显著减少求解时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统变分量子算法在旅行商问题中需要大量量子比特和每次求解都需要重新优化电路结构的问题，旨在降低量子资源需求并提高求解效率。

Method: 使用紧凑的排列编码减少量子比特需求；采用优化-冻结-重用策略：首先通过模拟退火在训练实例上优化电路拓扑，然后冻结该结构并在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示出良好的泛化能力但存在可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法在中等规模问题上表现出色，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但面临可扩展性挑战，有望扩展到车辆路径和作业调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是当完整因果结构未知时。专家通常能提供摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种高层抽象来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在假设存在忠实且因果充分的分布条件下，给定摘要因果图的背景知识，保证微观层面时间变量间边可定向性的理论条件。

Result: 研究结果提供了微观层面边定向的理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。

Conclusion: 这些发现为利用摘要因果图指导复杂时序系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导，强调了整合专家知识以改进从观测时间序列数据中进行因果推断的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

<details>

Motivation: 临床文档解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一大语言模型在高风险临床任务中缺乏稳健性，需要更精准可靠的自动化方案

Method: 设计了一个协作式多氏代理系统(MAS)，模拟临床会议团队。Manager代理协调动态分配的专科代理团队，进行层次化、迭代性辩论以达成共识

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集的420份备忙稿上评估，动态多氏代理配置在识别凑急性心力衰竭、急性肾伤伤和感染性伤胆时表现一致提升，辩论分析显示能有效表面和衡量冲突证据

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、稳健和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Conclusion: 该方法为PDE约束的参数化变分反问题提供了一种高效的求解策略，特别适用于不确定性量化等需要多次求解的场景。

Abstract: We consider parametrized variational inverse problems that are constrained by
partial differential equations (PDEs). We seek to efficiently compute the
solution of the inverse problem when auxiliary model parameters, which appear
in the governing PDE, are varied. Computing the solution of the inverse problem
for different auxiliary parameter values is crucial for uncertainty
quantification. This, however, is computationally challenging since it requires
solving many optimization problems for different realizations of the auxiliary
parameters. We leverage pseudo-time continuation and solve an initial value

TL;DR: 本文为有限差分离散引入了背包限制和人工粘度技术，构建了高阶精确、熵稳定且无超参数的计算流体动力学方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 熵稳定方法在计算流体动力学中日益流行，但现有的不连续Galerkin方法需要扩展到有限差分格式，以在保持高精度、熵稳定性和正性保持的同时避免超参数依赖。

Method: 采用背包限制技术（混合低阶正性保持熵稳定方案与高阶精确方案）和熵修正人工粘度技术，针对有限差分离散进行改进。

Result: 提出的方案在光滑条件下保持高阶精度，具有熵稳定性，无超参数需求，且背包限制方案可证明保持可压缩Euler和Navier-Stokes方程的正性。

Conclusion: 两种方案在不牺牲性能的前提下，成功实现了高阶精确、熵稳定、正性保持的目标，为有限差分方法提供了有效的稳定性增强技术。

Abstract: Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of
computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a
discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave
much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a
new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin
methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity
preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in
order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity
preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction
artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy
inequality.
  In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial
viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve
high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and
are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme
provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance
tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.

Abstract: We present an energy conservative, quadrature based model reduction framework
for the compressible Euler equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics. Building on a
high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop
a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and
hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a
strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total
energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments
for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and
Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our
proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while
maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results
establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure
preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear
Lagrangian hydrodynamics.

Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and generalized quantum signal processing

functions. The achievable polynomials of QSP have restrictions on parity, while
GQSP eliminates these restrictions. In this paper, we further investigate GQSP
and present a quantum bi-conjugate gradient (BiCG) algorithm as an application.
First, we extend GQSP, which constructs functions of unitary matrices, to
general matrices. We refer to this extension as generalized quantum singular
value transformation (GQSVT). Subsequently, we implement the quantum BiCG
method, utilizing GQSVT and swap test, which has a relatively shallow circuit
depth and requires a small number of ancilla qubits.

Abstract: In this study, we present a simulation-based numerical method for solving a
class of singularly perturbed second-order differential equations that come
from a simplified biologically motivated model of human gait. Important
physical factors such as gravity, damping, and leg stiffness are included in
the model, which also depicts the vertical motion of the center of mass of the
body during walking or running. Most of the time, standard numerical methods
are ineffective in resolving boundary layer behavior that occurs due to the
small perturbation parameter in the governing equation. We use a domain
decomposition technique to divide the problem domain into inner and outer
regions to tackle this difficulty. The boundary layer resolves the steep
gradients. We applied a time-rescaling transformation to the inner region. Each
subdomain is discretized, and the resulting tridiagonal systems are efficiently
solved using the Thomas algorithm within the mixed finite difference framework.
A detailed convergence analysis demonstrates second-order accuracy in space.
The numerical results validate the proposed scheme's accuracy, stability, and
efficiency through experiments based on modified human gait models. The
framework serves as a fundamental tool for biomechanical simulation. The
modeling is a foundation for future research, incorporating nonlinearities,
time delays, and real-world scenarios data on how people walk.

Abstract: The ultra--relativistic Euler equations describe gases in the relativistic
case when the thermal energy dominates. These equations for an ideal gas are
given in terms of the pressure, the spatial part of the dimensionless
four-velocity, and the particle density. Kunik et al.\ (2024,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113330) proposed genuine multi--dimensional
benchmark problems for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. In particular,
they compared full two-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin simulations for
radially symmetric problems with solutions computed using a specific
one-dimensional scheme. Of particular interest in the solutions are the
formation of shock waves and a pressure blow-up. In the present work we derive
an entropy-stable flux for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. Therefore,
we derive the main field (or entropy variables) and the corresponding
potentials. We then present the entropy-stable flux and conclude with
simulation results for different test cases both in 2D and in 3D.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of reconstructing a random source from
statistical phaseless data for the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. The
major challenge of this problem is non-uniqueness, which we overcome through a
reference source technique. Firstly, we introduce some artificially added point
sources into the inverse random source system and derive phase retrieval (PR)
formulas for the expectation and variance of the radiated fields. This paper
rigorously analyze the uniqueness and stability of the recovered statistics of
the radiated fields. Afterwards, since the direct problem has a unique mild
solution, by examining the expectation and variance of this solution and
combined with the phase retrieval formulas, we derive the Fredholm integral
equations to solve the inverse random source problem (IRSP). We prove the
stability of the corresponding integral equations. To quantify the uncertainty
of the random source, we utilize the Bayesian method to reconstruct the random
source and establish the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. Finally,
numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and
validate the theoretical results.

Abstract: Kemeny's constant quantifies a graph's connectivity by measuring the average
time for a random walker to reach any other vertex. We introduce two concepts

use them to define centrality measures for edges and non-edges in the graph.
Additionally, we present a sensitivity measure of Kemeny's constant. An
explicit expression for these quantities involving the inverse of the modified
graph Laplacian is provided, which is valid even for cut-edges. These measures
are connected to the one introduced in [Altafini et al., SIMAX 2023], and
algorithms for their computation are included. The benefits of these measures
are discussed, along with applications to road networks and link prediction
analysis. For one-path graphs, an explicit expression for these measures is
given in terms of the edge weights.

Abstract: The simulation of complex systems, such as gas transport in large pipeline
networks, often involves solving PDEs posed on intricate graph structures. Such
problems require considerable computational and memory resources. The Random
Batch Method (RBM) has shown promise in addressing these challenges via
stochastic decomposition techniques. In this paper, we apply the RBM at the PDE
level for parabolic equations on graphs, without assuming any preliminary
discretization in space or time. We consider a non-overlapping domain
decomposition in which the PDE coefficients and source terms are randomized. We
prove that the resulting RBM-based scheme converges, in the mean-square sense
and uniformly in time, to the true PDE solution with first-order accuracy in
the RBM step size. Numerical experiments confirm this convergence rate and
demonstrate substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time
compared to solving on the full graph. Moreover, these advantages persist
across different time discretization schemes.

Abstract: We present and analyze in a unified setting two schemes for the numerical
discretization of a Darcy-Forchheimer fluid flow model coupled with an
advection-diffusion equation modeling the temperature distribution in the
fluid. The first approach is based on fully discontinuous Galerkin
discretization spaces. In contrast, in the second approach, the velocity is
approximated in the Raviart-Thomas space, and the pressure and temperature are
still piecewise discontinuous. A fixed-point linearization strategy, naturally
inducing an iterative splitting solution, is proposed for treating the
nonlinearities of the problem. We present a unified stability analysis and
prove the convergence of the iterative algorithm under mild requirements on the
problem data. A wide set of two- and three-dimensional simulations is presented
to assess the error decay and demonstrate the practical performance of the
proposed approaches in physically sound test cases.

Abstract: Wind tunnel's consisting an array of computer controlled/programmable fans
have evolved over the last three decades for simulating the atmospheric
turbulence to study the aerodynamic loads over bluff bodies such as buildings
and bridges. In addition to civil engineering structures, these wind tunnels
can also have applications extending towards free-flight aerodynamic tests on
drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Achieving velocity profiles such as
linearly sheared flows or boundary layer flows in a traditional wind tunnel
would require long fetch lengths for the flow to evolve. However, in this work,
with the aid of an array of computer-controlled fans, a perfectly linearly
sheared flow can be developed at a distance of 1 meter from the source. Unlike
the previous fan-array wind tunnels (FAWT) developed for atmospheric boundary
layer flows, the fan-array tunnel constructed in this work does not include a
contraction section or a honeycomb, offering portability and compactness for
performing unconfined flight tests. The current work involves the design and
development of a 10 x 10 two-dimensional array of multiple fans facing a 2.4 m
long, enclosed test section with a 1.44 $m^2$ cross-sectional area. A
comprehensive characterization of key flow parameters, including turbulence
intensity, mean velocity, and pressure, in the streamwise, spanwise, and
transverse directions of the test section is investigated in the developed
FAWT. These measurements were conducted under three distinct flow conditions,
namely uniform, linearly sheared, and parabolic. Additionally, this work also
presents the evolution of the turbulent length scales and time scales across
various sections inside the tunnel for a range of wind speeds by employing
autocorrelation techniques and power spectral analysis.

Method: 使用微观规模方法（耗散粒子动力学DPD和多粒子碰撞动力学MPCD）进行模拟，并与纯理论系列解法（扩展到第十阶）进行对比。

Result: 发现DPD、MPCD和第四阶系列解法在流速和流量率方面具有良好一致性，微观方法由于壁面滑移导致略高估。系列解法在短港道长度和大振幅时失效。

Conclusion: DPD和MPCD是方便且相对准确的方法，特别适用于纯理论系列解法无法处理的微港道形状。

Abstract: We computationally study the flow of Newtonian fluids through sinusoidal
expansion-contraction microchannels at low Reynolds number. We first use a
perturbation method to analytically derive series solutions for the stream
function and volumetric flow rate that extend prior work [P.K. Kitanidis and
B.B. Dykaar, Transport in Porous Media 26, 89-98 (1997)] up to tenth order. We
then employ two particle-based mesoscale methods, dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) and multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD), to simulate the same flows.
We find that the fluid velocity at the expansion and contraction points as well
as the volumetric flow rate are in good agreement between DPD, MPCD, and the
fourth-order series solution for a wide range of microchannel geometries. The
mesoscale fluid models exhibit some slip at the walls, leading to a small but
consistent overprediction of the velocity and volumetric flow rate. The series
solution fails for short microchannel lengths and large amplitudes; we identify
lengths and amplitudes for which it converges to a given order. Overall, we
find that DPD and MPCD are convenient and reasonably accurate methods,
particularly for microchannel geometries where the series solution fails or is
cumbersome to implement.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Lagrangian trajectories in turbulent flow remains
challenging due to limited temporal information in transport functions. This
paper shows that even with sparse temporal observations, there might be enough
information from surrounding coherent motions, sharing the same dynamics, to
provide highly probable trajectories. The proposed coherent predictor is
derived from the concept of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), which are
advective transport barriers that govern the cohesive motion of neighbouring
particles. Coherent trajectories are quantified using a local segmentation with
the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE). The coherent predictor incorporates
information from the particle's position history and neighbouring coherent
velocity and acceleration into a novel generic energy function to predict its
trajectory. We assess our proposed approach using both three-dimensional (3D)
synthetic and experimental data of the wake behind a smooth cylinder and
two-dimensional (2D) homogeneous isotropic turbulent (HIT) flow. The coherent
predictor is deemed generic due to its consistent behaviour regardless of flow
dimensions, Reynolds number, and flow topology. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal parameters of the proposed energy function can be modelled based on
measurement uncertainties, resulting in enhanced prediction accuracy and
reduced uncertainty compared to current methods. We reveal direct signatures of
flow topology, including the cylinder leading edge boundary layer, sideward
shear layers, and vortex formation structures, on the prediction error map.
These topologies, which are fundamental structures in fluid dynamics, are
marked by high Lagrangian gradients and 3D directional motions. These findings
on coherent predictions hold great potential for various Lagrangian analyses in
turbulence.

Motivation: 海山被认为是海洋的"搅拌棒"，潮汐与三维地形相互作用产生湍流混合，对海洋物质输运和环流有重要影响，需要深入研究其混合机制和效率。

Method: 采用大涡模拟(LES)方法，模拟理想化陡峭海山在潮汐主导流场（潮汐振荡叠加较弱平均流）中的流动，分析地形、近尾流和脱落涡旋之间的复杂相互作用。

Result: 海山尾流是混合热点区域，在附着剪切层、水力射流、近尾流再循环区和脱落涡旋外围观测到高耗散率；垂直剪切是主要耗散机制；潮汐周期内尾流体积积分耗散至少是内波通量的4倍；纯潮汐设置下归一化耗散率最大；混合效率在流场反转期间达到峰值约0.25。

Conclusion: 三维海山地形通过潮汐相互作用产生强烈的湍流混合，尾流区域是重要的混合热点，垂直剪切起主导作用，潮汐反转阶段混合效率最高，这对理解海洋物质输运和能量耗散具有重要意义。

Abstract: Oceanic turbulence influences the transport and mixing of freshwater, heat,
nutrients, and other biogeochemical tracers. It also has broader implications
for oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Tides contribute substantially to the
mechanically driven turbulent ocean mixing through the internal waves resulting
from tide-topography interactions. Tidal currents also drive turbulent wakes
and shear layers when the topography is 3D. The hypothesis that seamounts are
the ``stirring rods'' of the ocean has motivated considerable recent interest
in turbulent flow features near 3D topography. It also motivates the present
LES of tidally dominated flows (tidal oscillations superposed on a weaker mean)
past an idealized steep seamount. Complex interactions occur between the
topography, the near wake, and previously shed vortices, especially during the
tidal phases when the flow direction is reversed. The topographic wake is shown
to be a hotspot for mixing, featuring large dissipation rates in the attached
shear layers, hydraulic jet, recirculation region in the near wake, and
peripheries of shed vortices. The majority of the observed dissipation is due
to the vertical shear. Over a tidal cycle, the volume-integrated local
dissipation within the wake is at least four times greater than the internal
wave flux that may be dissipated elsewhere. Furthermore, normalized dissipation
rates are maximized for the purely tidal setting. Within the tidal cycle, bulk
mixing efficiency ($\eta$) varies substantially and is maximized at $\eta
\approx 0.25$ around flow reversals.

Motivation: 研究连续相粘度对液-液两相Taylor-Couette流动转变的影响，这类流动在多相流系统中具有重要基础和应用价值。

Method: 采用不同浓度的甘油-水溶液作为连续相，大豆油作为分散相，通过可视化实验观察流动转变，使用雷诺数(Re)和韦伯数(We)构建流动图谱，并用斯托克斯数(St)评估液滴惯性。

Result: 发现流动转变遵循We ~ Re^A的幂律关系，TR I转变的指数A与粘度无关，TR II转变的A随粘度增加而减小。稳定带状流形成是由于液滴惯性损失，与液滴微米化和连续相惯性增加相关。

Conclusion: 连续相粘度对不同类型的流动转变具有不同影响，稳定带状流的形成机制与液滴惯性损失密切相关，这为理解多相Taylor-Couette流动提供了重要见解。

Abstract: A liquid-liquid two-phase Taylor-Couette flow is of fundamental and practical
importance in multiphase flow systems. This study investigates the flow
transitions in such a system with constant axial flow and gradually increased
rotation of the inner cylinder. To clarify the effect of continuous-phase
viscosity on flow transitions, several concentrations of glycerol-water
solutions were employed as the continuous phase, while soybean oil was used as
the dispersed phase. Visualization experiments revealed that the flow undergoes
a cascade of transitions: stratified flow, disturbed stratified flow,
transitional droplet flow (observed only in limited cases), unstable banded
flow, and stable banded flow. A flow map was constructed using two
dimensionless parameters, Reynolds number (Re) and Weber number (We). The
transitions from disturbed stratified to unstable banded flow (TR I) and from
unstable to stable banded flow (TR II) were found to be approximately expressed
by a power-law relation of the form We ~ Re^A, where A is a fitting exponent.
For TR I, A showed no clear dependence on continuous-phase viscosity,
suggesting the combined effects of inertia, viscosity, and interfacial tension.
In contrast, A decreased with increasing viscosity in TR II, becoming nearly
zero at high glycerol concentration. Furthermore, to clarify the mechanism of
stable banded flow formation, the droplet inertia was evaluated using the
Stokes number (St). It was revealed that the stable banded structure results
from the loss of droplet inertia, associated with droplet micronization under
higher rotation and the increasing inertia of the continuous phase.

Abstract: This study establishes a symmetry-based framework to quantify non-equilibrium
processes in complex pressure gradient (PG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs),
using a Lie-group-informed dilation-symmetry-breaking formalism. We derive a
universal multilayer defect scaling law for the evolution of total shear stress
(TSS). The law shows that gradually varying adverse pressure gradients (APGs)
break the dilation symmetry in the two-layer defect scaling of equilibrium TSS,
leading to three-layer TSS structures. For abrupt PG transitions, we identify
boundary-layer decoupling into: 1) an equilibrium internal boundary layer, and
2) a history-dependent outer flow, arising from disparate adaptation
timescales. The framework introduces a unified velocity scale mapping
non-equilibrium TSS to canonical zero-PG scaling. Validation spans different
aerodynamic systems, including developing APG on airfoils, APG-to-favorable-PG
transition on a Gaussian bump, and favorable PG to rapidly amplifying APG in a
converging-diverging channel. The work enables improved prediction of
non-equilibrium PG TBL behavior through unified characterization of stress
evolution dynamics, providing new physics-based parameterizations that could
promote machine learning of complex wall-bounded turbulent flows.

Conclusion: 尽管磁场对汞流有强阻尼作用，但两流体界面相互作用与气层剪切诱导不稳定性结合，可能随磁场增强导致流动失稳

Abstract: Long wave instability of a stratified two-phase MHD parallel flow between two
infinite plates is studied. It is argued that electric conductivity of the
plates affects qualitatively the base flow and its stability properties, which
calls for separate stability studies for the cases of perfectly insulating,
perfectly conducting boundaries, or boundaries with finite conductivity. In
this study we examine the effect of the transverse magnetic field on long wave
instability of a two-layer flow consisting of layers of conductive liquid and
non-conductive gas, for the cases of perfectly insulating or perfectly
conducting lower boundary, considering a mercury-air system as a representative
test case. To capture the behavior at small but finite wavenumbers, we extend
the conventional first-order long-wave stability analysis by incorporating
higher order terms. The results and discussion address the characteristics of
the base flow, stability maps and profiles of the most unstable disturbances.
The stability diagrams show that among the anticipated stabilizing effect of
the magnetic field, at certain parameters a destabilization is observed. It is
further argued that in spite the flow of mercury is strongly damped by the
magnetic field, interaction of the two fluids at the interface becomes the
strongest destabilizing effect, which, together with the shear-induced
instabilities in the gas layer, may lead to flow destabilization with the
increasing magnetic field.

Conclusion: 周期性旋转圆柱体上的薄粘性薄膜流动展现出丰富的非线性动力学行为，包括分形结构、有限时间奇点形成以及频率依赖的稳定性特征，为类似流体动力学问题提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The flow of a thin viscous film on the outside of a horizontal circular
cylinder, whose angular velocity is time-periodic with specified frequency and
amplitude, is investigated. The constant angular velocity problem was
originally studied by Moffatt (1977) and Pukhnachev (1977). Surface tension is
neglected. The evolution equation for the film thickness is solved numerically
for a range of oscillation amplitudes and frequency. A blow-up map charted in
amplitude-frequency space reveals highly intricate fractal-like structures
exhibiting self-similarity. For a general initial condition the film surface
reaches a slope singularity at a finite time and tends to overturn. The
high-frequency and low-frequency limits are examined asymptotically using a
multiple-scales approach. At high frequency the analysis suggests that an
appropriate choice of initial profile can substantially delay the overturning
time, and even yield a time-periodic solution. In the low-frequency limit it is
possible to construct a quasi-periodic solution that does not overturn if the
oscillation amplitude lies below a threshold value. Above this value the
solution tends inexorably toward blow-up. It is shown how solutions exhibiting
either a single-shock or a double-shock may be constructed in common with the
steadily rotating cylinder problem.

Abstract: The simulation of transcritical flows remains challenging due to strong
thermodynamic nonlinearities that induce spurious pressure oscillations in
conventional schemes.While primitive-variable formulations offer improved
robustness under such conditions, they are always limited by energy
conservation errors and the absence of systematic high-order treatments for
numerical fluxes. In this paper, we introduce the Central Differential flux
with High-Order Dissipation (CDHD), a novel numerical flux solver designed for
primitive-variable discretization. This method combines a central flux for
advection with a minimal, upwind-biased dissipation term to stabilize the
simulation while maintaining formal accuracy. The dissipation term effectively
suppresses oscillations and improves stability in transcritical flows. Compared
to traditional primitive-variable approaches, CDHD reduces the energy
conservation error in two order of magnitude. When incorporated into a hybrid
framework with a conservative shock-capturing scheme, the method robustly
handles both smooth transcritical phenomena and shock waves. Numerical tests
validate the accuracy, stability, and energy-preserving capabilities of CDHD,
demonstrating its potential as a reliable tool for complex real-gas flow
simulations.

Abstract: Accurate real-time forecasting of cryogenic tank behavior is essential for
the safe and efficient operation of propulsion and storage systems in future
deep-space missions. While cryogenic fluid management (CFM) systems
increasingly require autonomous capabilities, conventional simulation methods
remain hindered by high computational cost, model imperfections, and
sensitivity to unanticipated boundary condition changes. To address these
limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Real-Time Forecasting Framework
for Cryogenic Propellant Management in Space Systems, featuring a lightweight,
non-intrusive method named ARCTIC (Adaptive Real-time Cryogenic Tank Inference
and Correction). ARCTIC integrates real-time sensor data with precomputed nodal
simulations through a data-driven correction layer that dynamically refines
forecast accuracy without modifying the underlying model. Two updating
mechanisms, auto-calibration and observation and correction, enable continuous
adaptation to evolving system states and transient disturbances. The method is
first assessed through synthetic scenarios representing self-pressurization,
sloshing, and periodic operations, then validated using experimental data from
NASA's Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed and K-Site facilities. Results
demonstrate that ARCTIC significantly improves forecast accuracy under model
imperfections, data noise, and boundary fluctuations, offering a robust
real-time forecasting capability to support autonomous CFM operations. The
framework's compatibility with existing simulation tools and its low
computational overhead make it especially suited for onboard implementation in
space systems requiring predictive autonomy.
