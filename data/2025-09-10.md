### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态基础表征，无需微调即可泛化到未见数据集，在JUMP数据集上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 引入CellPainTR Transformer架构，采用源特定上下文token设计，实现无需微调的有效分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等传统方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能，展现强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于图像的谱分析创建真正的基础模型迈出了重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，结合图像和音频信息进行铁路缺陷检测，相比单模态视觉方法精度提升0.2个百分点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态视觉检测方法在铁路结构元素检测中存在过度检测问题，特别是当缺陷外观与正常结构元素相似时，需要结合音频信号来提高检测精度

Method: 构建基于领域规则的多模态融合架构，使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer从多个层级（7、16、19）提取特征图，并与合成的音频表征进行融合，针对两类缺陷：铁路断裂和表面缺陷

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验评估显示，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提高了0.2个百分点，Student's非配对t检验证实了平均准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能有效提升铁路缺陷检测性能，结合音频和图像信息可以克服单模态方法的局限性，在真实场景中具有更好的应用价值

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重正交分解获得类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来实现领先性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用，需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法

Method: ClaFR方法：对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间，将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示，通过计算子空间内的特征重构误差来确定OOD分数

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试上实现了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影视角解决了数据隐私场景下的OOD检测问题，性能优异且无需训练数据

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，可将基础模型适配到新领域，特别适合小数据集场景，无需标签和额外超参数，使用1000张图像即可显著提升DINOv3等先进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域中，可用数据集通常很小，限制了SSL方法的应用，且预训练模型通常只发布主干权重，缺乏继续预训练的重要信息。需要一种简单有效的策略来将基础模型适配到新的数据分布。

Method: 提出DIET-CP持续预训练策略，使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数。该方法稳定适用于不同数据模态和主干网络选择。

Result: DIET-CP使用仅1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型提供显著的性能提升，证明了在小数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: DIET-CP是一种简单有效的持续预训练方法，能够将强大的基础模型引导到感兴趣的新数据分布，解决了小数据集场景下的适配问题。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种增强联邦提示调优对抗鲁棒性的新方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法在面对对抗攻击时容易导致下游任务错误分类，特别是在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同模型层间的提示耦合

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出优异的泛化能力

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的鸿沟，通过10个关键业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在7500个真实样本上评估开源VLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映企业实际应用需求，如社交媒体内容分析的复杂性，需要建立更贴近企业部署的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法解决无序OCR输出比较问题，构建7500个真实样本数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行评估。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM模型上进行了行业基础的、任务驱动的能力评估，为企业在实际环境中部署VLM提供了可行见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功连接了学术研究与实际企业需求，为开源视觉语言模型在企业环境中的部署提供了实用的评估标准和指导。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基准为0.847）和ECE 0.036（基准为0.058），提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，其中扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，通过三种方法学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行实验。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞胸部CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比异常X光检测（+0.041 AUROC），获得25-37%的校准改进，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome技术减少了协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡和部署指南，包括去识别化和偏差审计，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉语言模型在处理突破文字时的弹性和识别能力，发现当代VLMs虽在清晰文本上表现强劲，但在文字穿插、融合、遮挡等干扰下性能严重下降，显示出结构性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类对突破文字的弹性识别能力，并探索先进视觉语言模型是否也具备类似的弹性。识别模型在文字识别中的结构性缺陷，以推动更健壮的多模态系统发展。

Method: 构建两个受心理物理学启发的测试标准（中文象形文字和英语字母词汇），通过切割、重组和叠加字形来创造"可见但不可读"的刺激物，但仍保持人类可读性。测试当代VLMs在这些干扰下的表现。

Result: 虽然在清晰文本上表现强劲，但当代VLMs在这些突破条件下性能严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出。模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性，而少了解析组合结构的先验知识。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了VLMs在文字识别方面的结构性限制，建议需要设计能够编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构，以支持在教育、无障碍访问、文化遗产和安全等领域的应用。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在频域进行特征级学习的方法，通过时间融合策略生成k空间数据，用于动态心脏MRI重建，在低数据情况下表现出强大的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心脏磁共振成像的动态性和复杂性，高质量且多样化的k空间数据在实践中很少可用，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的稳健重建。

Method: 在频域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，将频域视为自然全局特征空间；采用时间融合策略整合不同时间帧的k空间数据来指导和优化生成轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据情况下具有强大的生成能力，能够有效缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 频域特征级建模结合时间融合策略为动态心脏MRI重建提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下表现出实用潜力。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 模型在语义和感知上差异较大的类别间进行属性知识过渡的能力有限，性能随训练测试集相关性减弱而冲击性下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型在语义和感知差异较大的类别间过渡属性知识的能力，探索当前模型是否能够抽象属性并应用于概念距离远的类别

Method: 通过五种方法逐步减少训练测试集相关性：LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类、超类分区，测试模型在无关对象类型间推理共享属性的能力

Result: 随着训练测试集相关性的降低，模型性能冲击性下降，聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面取得最佳找平衡

Conclusion: 当前表示学习方法在属性推理任务中存在显著局限性，对分割设计敏感，需要更加健壮的基准测试构建

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人在循环的量化评估框架，用于评估大语言模型生成的3D模型的几何和结构保真度，通过综合性指标体系进行基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够解释多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但对于几何和结构保真度的评估方法仍不完善，需要开发稳健的评估方法来支持CAD设计民主化、旧设计反向工程和快速原型制造等应用。

Method: 提出了一套综合的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积准确性、表面对齐度、尺寸保真度和拓扑结构复杂度，并以L垂尺组件为案例研究，系统比较了四种输入模态下的模型性能。

Result: 研究发现随着语义丰富度的提升，生成保真度明显改善，代码级提示能够在所有指标上实现完美重建。量化评估方法能够显著提高向真实值的收敛速度，特别是相比传统仅依赖视觉检查和人类直觉的定性方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还提供了一种可扩展的方法论来验证和精炼生成模型，为多样化的CAD应用提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS²是一个针对3D高斯泼溅的内存优化框架，通过减少基元数量和每个基元的参数，实现了显著的显存压缩，在保持渲染质量的同时减少50%静态显存和40%渲染显存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然在新视角合成中表现出色，但其高内存消耗限制了在边缘设备上的应用。现有压缩方法大多只关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存的关键瓶颈问题。

Method: 1) 用轻量级的任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示；2) 提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，MEGS²相比现有方法实现了50%的静态显存减少和40%的渲染显存减少，同时保持了相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数数量，成功解决了3DGS的渲染内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Result: 在生成建模中应用于测试时奖励对齐，有效提升美学质量和文本对齐，防止奖励黑客攻击并加速收敛

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法优于现有高斯性正则化，为文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化提供了有效的统一框架

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见，发现大型多模态模型会系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，并存在默认男性偏见，但不同模型间偏见程度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了大型多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析，需要开发标准化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板男性、刻板女性和非刻板职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张结果图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 研究发现：1）LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象；2）模型存在强烈默认男性偏见；3）不同模型间偏见程度差异显著（男性代表性从46.7%到73.3%）。表现最佳的模型接近性别平等。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。这项工作提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化自动化评估工具对于促进AI开发公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，用于解决多视图重建中transformer模型的二次复杂度瓶颈问题，实现了4倍推理加速且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer-based多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）虽然效果出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈。通过分析发现注意力概率质量集中在少数跨视图几何匹配的patch交互上。

Method: 受结构化注意力和大语言模型最新进展的启发，提出使用高度优化的块稀疏核来替代密集的全局注意力操作，无需重新训练主干网络，支持VGGT和π³模型，并能处理大规模图像集。

Result: 在全面的多视图基准测试中，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持了相当的任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中transformer模型的 scalability 问题，为大规模图像集处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端存在威胁面，细微的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时逃避启发式检查。

Method: 在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动的时间规律性，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复机制来恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上使用多种欺骗强度进行评估，实验结果显示在轨迹和姿态误差方面相比无防御基线有显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督检测和恢复机制能有效应对VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，提高系统的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，旨在系统评估这些技术是否具有反取证作用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的GAN增强技术，在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上评估对朴素、空间和频域检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 基础增强滤波器可将检测准确率显著降低（ASR达64.63%），GAN技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调需要更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，监督学习需要大量人工标注，且新类别可能随时出现。现有方法主要关注半监督学习，但本文探索完全无监督的新类别发现方法。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成向量嵌入，通过注意力机制估计聚类数量，并整合流形学习技术利用数据内在几何结构来优化嵌入表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上，无论是已知还是未知聚类数量的情况下，都实现了单模态聚类和新类别发现的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 提出的完全无监督方法能够有效发现图像数据集中的新类别，为开放世界学习提供了新的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种新颖的双提示双分支多模态模型，结合图像特征和临床文本，通过全局语义和局部边界建模实现精确的乳腺超声分割，在BLU数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声精确分割对可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小病灶或低对比度病灶因边界模糊和斑点噪声而难以分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但现有方法容易产生粗糙的边界响应。

Method: 提出XBusNet双提示双分支模型：全局路径基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码全图像语义，局部U-Net路径强调精确边界，通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的提示进行调制。提示从结构化元数据自动组装，无需手动标注。

Result: 在BLU数据集上达到平均Dice 0.8765和IoU 0.8149，优于六个强基线。小病灶提升最明显，漏检区域和伪激活减少。消融研究显示全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的互补作用。

Conclusion: 融合全局语义和局部精度的双提示双分支多模态设计能产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，提高对小而低对比度病灶的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释性特征的协同作用能够创建高准确的医学诊断工具，DPM增帽和非线性特征融合是成功的关键因素

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练依赖图像-文本对，但标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，即使使用数百个词描述简单图像也存在信息缺失问题。

Method: RecA利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为密集文本提示，通过自监督重建损失优化模型重建输入图像，实现理解与生成的对齐。

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval上生成性能从0.73提升到0.90，DPGBench从80.93提升到88.15，编辑基准也有显著提升，超越更大的开源模型。

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于各种UMM架构，能显著改善生成和编辑保真度。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合，减少冗余信息影响

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上的实验表明，DEPF在目标检测方面表现优异，优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，通过双域增强和优先级引导融合实现了更好的检测性能

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN通过拓扑图精炼和门控信息传播机制，成功解决了骨架动作识别中模糊动作区分困难的问题，具有很好的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL模型，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部位。通过自上而下分解和自下而上组合，构建模态特定解析图，使用递归双向交叉注意力并进行GM净化

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过多模态交互和引导机制，有效提升了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计性能

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,

TL;DR: LGAA是一个轻量级高斯资产适配器框架，通过多视角扩散先验统一建模几何和PBR材质，实现端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D资产创建需要大量人工和经验，现有方法主要关注几何建模而忽略材质合成，需要端到端的PBR就绪3D生成解决方案

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层，LGAA Switcher整合多个扩散先验，LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯泼溅，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重照明网格

Result: 实验证明LGAA在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型中表现优异，模块化设计支持灵活整合多个扩散先验，仅需69k多视角实例即可高效收敛

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了几何和PBR材质的统一建模，为端到端3D资产生成提供了有效解决方案，代码和预训练权重将公开

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用注视信息提升多模态大模型在自我中心视频问答中的表现，通过注视引导的意图提示方法显著改善模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，自我中心视频通过统一坐标系捕获用户焦点、动作和上下文，为个性化AI体验提供了机会。

Method: 构建包含注视信息的QA对数据集，采用注视引导的意图提示方法整合空间、时间和意图相关线索，并进行注视相关的微调实验。

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升了性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果。

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心环境中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值。

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Motivation: 现有跨视角地理定位方法局限于单一视角或模态，且缺乏可解释性——只能预测图像是否对应而不解释匹配依据

Method: GLEAM-C将无人机影像、街景地图、全景视图和地面照片与卫星影像对齐；GLEAM-X利用多模态大语言模型进行可解释推理，构建双语基准数据集

Result: 实现了与先前模态特定模型相当的准确性，同时通过优化实现提高了训练效率，建立了系统性的可解释跨视角推理评估框架

Conclusion: GLEAM-C和GLEAM-X形成了一个完整的CVGL流程，统一了准确的跨视角匹配与可解释推理，通过使模型能够更好地解释和匹配来推进地理定位技术的发展

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现OCT到OCTA的层感知血管重建，显著提升视网膜血管图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异，难以重建诊断所需的密集血管细节

Method: 提出跨维度监督模块利用2D分层投影作为监督信号，结合多尺度特征融合模块通过通道重加权策略增强血管描绘

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上实验证明XOCT显著改进en-face投影质量，对临床视网膜病理评估具有重要意义

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可访问性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning方法，通过选择性移除有偏样本或特征表示来减少视觉模型中的偏见，无需重新训练即可显著提升模型公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中容易依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏见或不公平的预测。传统偏见缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的后处理模型校正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法。在三个基准数据集上进行实证分析：CUB-200-2011（姿态偏见）、CIFAR-10（合成补丁偏见）和CelebA（微笑检测中的性别偏见）。

Result: 后处理遗忘方法能显著减少子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提升94.86%，CIFAR-10上提升30.28%，CelebA上提升97.37%。这些改进以最小的准确率损失实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘技术为增强已部署视觉系统的公平性提供了一个实用框架，无需进行完整的重新训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL提供了一个实用高效的视频内容创作和编辑解决方案，克服了前景一致性和时间连贯性等关键挑战。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在放射影像分类中表现优异但可解释性差，限制了临床接受度，需要开发能够透明解释决策过程的模型。

Method: 将图像分割为不重叠的补丁，独立分类每个补丁并聚合预测结果，无需后处理技术即可可视化每个补丁的诊断贡献。

Conclusion: 综合隐式神经表示与沉硅模型的方法有效解决了向量图形动画自动化的挑战，保持了向量图形的核心特性

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染方面表现出色，但由于表示的非结构化和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建。

Method: 为每个高斯基元关联可学习的SDF值，设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略，自适应地在几何一致区域分布高斯基元。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS一致提高了重建准确性和完整性，同时保持了高渲染保真度。

Conclusion: DiGS通过将SDF学习嵌入3DGS流程，成功实现了更好的几何一致性和表面重建质量，为3D重建提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Motivation: 当前的混合基础攻击策略覆盖全局语义特征或使用交叉瑣杂损失导致梯度消失，影响对抗性示例质量。

Method: 使用局部混合策略生成语义一致的多样化输入，将logit损失适配到非目标攻击场景，并应用扰动平滑损失提高转移性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过保持全局语义和缓解梯度消失问题，显著提高了对抗性攻击的转移性能力。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，而仅依赖2D框标注存在投影模糊性和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督方法

Method: 提出MVAT框架：1）跨时间聚合目标中心点云构建完整3D表示；2）采用教师-学生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时序聚合的静态对象；3）学生网络从单视图预测静态和移动对象；4）引入多视图2D投影损失确保3D框与所有可用2D标注的一致性

Conclusion: MVAT证明了利用时序多视图信息可以有效解决弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊性问题，为降低3D标注成本提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Conclusion: EHWGesture可作为推进多模态临床手势理解的综合基准数据集

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够通过少量样本快速适应新的空间控制任务，在多种扩散模型架构上实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应能力有限且训练成本高昂。

Method: 提出UFC方法，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和小规模任务特定参数更新。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上，仅用30个标注样本微调就能实现与空间条件一致的细粒度控制，使用0.1%全训练数据即可达到与全监督基线相当的性能。

Conclusion: UFC是一个通用且高效的少样本控制适配器，适用于多种扩散模型架构，为快速适应新空间控制任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hounsfield单位的医学图像前景掩码策略，改进了3D医学图像中的掩码图像建模方法，在多个数据集上显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机掩码策略忽略了医学图像中解剖对象的密度分布，无法有效利用HU值等医学图像特有的强度信息，导致在3D医学图像计算中的掩码图像建模效果受限。

Method: 利用Hounsfield Unit (HU)测量值实现基于HU的前景掩码策略，重点关注内脏器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等缺乏诊断意义的非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公开3D医学影像数据集上验证，显著提升了分割质量和Dice分数（BTCV: ~84.64%, Flare22: ~92.43%, MM-WHS: ~90.67%, Amos22: ~88.64%, BraTS: ~78.55%）。

Conclusion: 领域特定的掩码图像建模方法对于医学图像表示学习具有重要意义，为医学图像分割提供了一个有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Motivation: 文档图像蕴含丰富知识，语音查询具有便携性和灵活性，但此前没有工作探索在视觉文档图像上直接使用语音查询进行知识库问答

Method: 提出完全文本无关的端到端流水线，直接解析语音、检索相关视觉知识并生成答案，集成布局感知重排序机制优化检索

Result: 实验显示在效率和准确性方面都有显著提升，并发布了首个双语语音-文档RAG数据集

Conclusion: TextlessRAG为语音文档问答开辟了新方向，提供了高效准确的解决方案和基准数据集

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在高斯头部重建方面比现有方法更有效

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够实现快速高质量的单图头部重建，为三维头部生成领域提供了一种高效的解决方案

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CGAT架构，一种用于3D形状识别的可解释图注意力网络，通过注意力机制可视化决策过程，在牙齿发育阶段分类任务中实现了0.76的加权F1分数，并生成人类可理解的注意力图以增强模型可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在黑盒性质限制了其在高风险应用中的采用，特别是在需要信任和问责制的医学和法医学领域。为了解决3D形状识别任务中的可解释性问题，需要开发能够解释决策过程的模型。

Method: 提出了Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，应用于从CBCT图像提取的第三磨牙3D网格的Demirjian阶段分配任务。使用图注意力卷积和内在注意力机制，通过注意力rollout可视化决策过程。评估了局部平均曲率和到质心距离的节点特征，以及模型深度。

Result: 包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边的模型产生了更直观的注意力图，同时获得了良好的分类性能。局部平均曲率和到质心距离的组合特征略微提高了性能，达到0.76加权F1分数，并产生了更全面的注意力可视化。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，可以增强信任并促进专家对模型决策的验证。虽然是在牙科数据上演示，但CGAT广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务，促进透明且具有竞争力的深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为数字图像年龄估计提供全面的技术综述，验证已知年龄痕迹的特性，揭示现有方法可能存在的问题（如内容偏差），并强调可解释AI在验证取证技术可靠性中的重要性。

Method: 通过分析前人工作、重新实现必要方法、进行实验验证，包括：提出新的取证设置、验证传感器缺陷特性、分析神经网络学习特征、展示神经网络易受干扰等问题。

Result: 发现某些利用传感器缺陷进行图像年龄估计的方法实际上利用了其他痕迹（很可能是内容偏差）；验证了传感器缺陷的主要特性（增长率和空间分布）；展示了神经网络容易被分散注意力而无法学习真实年龄痕迹。

Conclusion: 时间图像取证领域需要更加严谨的验证方法，可解释AI技术对于确保取证技术的可靠性至关重要，现有的一些方法可能存在依赖内容偏差而非真实年龄痕迹的问题。

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言基础模型中的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，即使对非性别特征进行微小扰动（如遮挡10%物体或轻微模糊背景），也会导致偏见评分发生巨大变化，表明当前评估方法可能反映的是模型对虚假特征而非真实性别偏见的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实世界图像的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征（如物体和背景）之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估的失真。研究旨在探究这些虚假特征是否扭曲了性别偏见的评估结果。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP和PHASE）和各种VLMs中的非性别特征，量化它们对偏见评估的影响。具体包括遮挡物体和模糊背景等扰动方式。

Result: 即使最小扰动（如遮挡10%物体或弱模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见评分：生成式VLMs的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体的指标变化达43%。这表明当前偏见评估往往反映的是模型对虚假特征的响应，而非真实的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Motivation: 解决现有医疗视觉-语言模型对患者元数据利用不充分、缺乏临床诊断知识集成、以3D医学形像处理效果有限以及计算资源消耗大等问题。

Method: 1. 将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以丰富文本输入；2. 添加预测小米米神细状态检查(MMSE)分数的辅助token；3. 采用轻量级提示微调技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新地利用元数据和临床指标，实现了数据高效的3D医学形像模型适配，为医疗AI领域提供了一种经济有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Method: 提出自监督跨编码器框架，利用纵向MRI扫描的时间连续性进行监督。通过对比学习约束静态表征，捕获稳定解剖特征；通过输入梯度正则化指导动态表征，反映时间变化。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实现了更高的分类准确性和改进的可解释性。在OASIS数据集上展现出强大的零样本泛化能力，在PPMI数据集上实现了跨任务泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标签数据依赖和可解释性问题，为神经退行性疾病诊断提供了更准确和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

Motivation: 现有语义水印技术在潜在扩散模型中虽然能抵抗再生攻击，但由于频率完整性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称傅里叶水印(SFW)方法强制保持Hermitian对称性来维护频率完整性，并采用中心感知嵌入策略确保裁剪攻击下的信息保留。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种攻击场景下达到最先进的验证和识别性能，在保持优异图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)的同时获得最高检测准确率。

Conclusion: SFW框架有效平衡了鲁棒性和图像保真度，解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型推理模式单调且交互轮次有限，难以处理需要试错探索的困难视觉任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe数据集、迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹、提出超轮次掩码策略平衡训练效率与测试可扩展性。

Result: 模型在仅6轮训练限制下，推理时可自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，在挑战性视觉搜索任务上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Mini-o3能够产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径，有效解决复杂视觉搜索问题，展示了深度多轮推理的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出EDFFDNet网络，使用指数衰减基函数的自由形变来处理深度差异场景，结合自适应稀疏运动聚合器和渐进相关细化策略，显著降低计算成本并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单应性、多网格单应性或薄板样条的深度图像配准方法在处理包含深度差异的真实场景时存在固有局限性

Method: 提出指数衰减自由形变网络(EDFFDNet)，采用指数衰减基函数的自由形变；引入自适应稀疏运动聚合器(ASMA)替代MLP聚合器；提出渐进相关细化策略进行粗到细运动估计

Result: 参数减少70.5%，内存减少32.6%，总运行时间减少33.7%，PSNR提升0.5dB；增加局部细化阶段后PSNR进一步提升1.06dB，同时保持较低计算成本

Conclusion: EDFFDNet在处理深度差异场景时表现出色，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上优于之前的深度学习方法

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Motivation: 标准对抗训练无法显式处理类间特征重叠问题，而这是对抗性脏弱性的重要因素

Method: 识别每个对抗样本的最近跨类邻居，然后在特征空间中移除这些邻居的投影以强化特征可分离性

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN标准数据集上表现竞争力，同时在对抗性和清洁准确性方面取得显著成就

Conclusion: 显式处理类间特征近似性对增强深度网络的对抗性至关重要

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Result: 在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等数据集上取得了强劲的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过结合大语言模型代理和视频模块，并使用评论器来优化执行策略，可以有效提升复杂视频理解任务的性能

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

Motivation: 传统方法使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个区域分配专用熵模型，使用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时只引入最小的编码解码延迟，支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，为不同语义区域提供更准确的概率分布估计

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Motivation: 脑脏症是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率极高（40%），通过早期识别高风险患者来降低复发率。

Method: 收集3D脱内CTA图像数据和临床数据，训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二元分类（任务1）和生存分析分类（任务2）。

Result: 多模态模型在测试集上达到c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，发现心脏疾病（表格数据）和颈动脉（图像数据）是预测复发的关键因素。

Conclusion: 多模态AI模型能够有效预测脑脏症复发风险，为临床治疗规划提供支持，心脏疾病和颈动脉是关键预测指标。

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了发丝级头发重建，并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标，为头发重建领域提供了重要贡献

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Motivation: RayGauss在合成和室内场景的新视角合成中达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本阻碍了在真实世界场景中的实时渲染。

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化以减少误报交集，并提出新的致密化准则来改善远距离区域的密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度（FPS）提升，视觉质量PSNR提升高达0.56dB。

Conclusion: RayGaussX在保持高质量渲染的同时显著提升了训练和渲染效率，适用于大规模真实世界场景的实时新视角合成。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不需要高分辨率数据的情况下，通过融合多个低分辨率扯描来实现高效的超分辨率重建，在保证图像质量的同时大幅缩短扯描时间，为医学MR成像提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)虽然能够从多视角图像创建逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复缺失区域（如遮挡或场景编辑）时仍存在挑战，常导致模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致

Method: 结合两个关键思想：(1)联合深度和对象监督确保修复的高斯在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)一致性感知精炼方案选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其余部分

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill在视觉保真度上超越了现有的NeRF和3DGS修复方法，同时减少了24.5%的训练时间，提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影和更好的视角一致性

Conclusion: SplatFill为3DGS场景修复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，通过深度引导和一致性感知机制显著提升了修复效果

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

Conclusion: PLM框架通过对象中心理论有效解决了LLM与3D点云的表征差异，实现了稳健的3D理解能力

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Conclusion: 提出的诊断方法和D-LEAF框架能够有效定位和修正MLLM中的幻觉问题，显著提升模型性能且计算开销极小

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter

TL;DR: OCNet通过建立支持目标对象与查询通用对象之间的对象级相关性来解决少样本语义分割中的背景噪声问题，在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要建立在支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（不相关的背景对象），导致背景过拟合。

Method: 设计对象级相关网络（OCNet），包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和相关构建模块（CCM）。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程，在对象级信息中识别新对象，建立对象级相关性可以挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，从而提升少样本语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛评估表明，ScoreHOI在联合人-物交互重建方面实现了精确且稳健的改进，性能优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ScoreHOI通过扩散先验和物理约束的有效结合，显著提升了人-物交互重建的物理合理性和准确性，为该领域提供了新的优化解决方案。

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToothMCL，首个用于牙齿分割的多模态预训练框架，整合CBCT和IOS数据，在牙齿分割任务上达到最先进性能，DSC指标提升12%（CBCT）和8%（IOS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有牙齿分割方法缺乏严格验证，性能和临床适用性有限，需要开发更准确的多模态分割方法。

Method: 提出ToothMCL多模态对比学习框架，通过模态不变表示捕捉细粒度解剖特征，实现精确的多类牙齿分割和FDI编号识别。构建了最大的配对CBCT-IOS数据集CBCT-IOS3.8K。

Result: 在内部和外部测试中均达到最先进性能，CBCT分割DSC提升12%，IOS分割DSC提升8%，在不同成像条件和临床场景下表现出强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToothMCL是首个牙齿分割多模态预训练框架，显著提升了分割精度和临床适用性，为数字牙科提供了可靠的技术基础。

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段自适应推理算法，在消费级硬件上实现实时目标检测，通过系统级优化而非模型架构修改，在RTX 4060笔记本上获得1.85倍加速，仅损失5.51% mAP精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消费级硬件上目标检测器基准性能与实际部署性能之间的差距，发现系统级瓶颈而非计算能力是主要限制因素

Method: 提出两阶段自适应推理算法：先使用快速低分辨率检测，仅在置信度低时升级到高分辨率模型；比较架构早期退出和分辨率自适应路由策略

Result: 在5000张COCO图像测试中，相比PyTorch早期退出基线获得1.85倍加速，mAP损失仅为5.51%

Conclusion: 通过硬件感知的推理策略而非纯模型优化，为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了实用且可复现的解决方案

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了现有动态场景3D重建算法在重建漫旋太空物体时的性能，通过Isaac Sim模拟环境生成物理准确的图像序列，并使用Neuralangelo算法在静态场景中获得了高保真度的重建结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了支持在轨服务和主动废弃物清除任务中对不合作太空物体的形状和运动特性进行准确评估，需要有效地重建漫旋目标的3D模型。

Method: 使用Isaac Sim模拟环境生成物理准确的2D图像序列，并采用Neuralangelo算法进行静态场景的3D重建。通过Cloud Compare工具对比重建模型与原始CAD模型的误差。

Result: 在静态场景中，Neuralangelo算法能够生成与原始CAD模型高度匹配的3D网格，误差最小且几乎没有人工疑点，能够捐描关键细节特征。

Conclusion: 研究为动态场景重建的进一步评估提供了基准，静态场景下的成功重建表明方法的可行性。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出一种解码器，通过引导扩散模型生成与用户指定特征高度匹配的图像，以分析深度神经网络的特征空间，揭示图像属性如何被编码到特征中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的特征提取过程具有黑盒特性，难以理解内部特征空间。本文旨在开发一种能够生成与指定特征精确匹配图像的解码器，以分析DNN如何编码图像属性。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中，通过最小化生成图像特征与用户指定特征之间的欧几里得距离来指导生成过程。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，显示生成图像的特征与指定特征高度相似，并揭示了这些DNN特征空间的有价值洞察。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解深度神经网络的特征编码机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个用于单次参考图像6D姿态估计的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐和文本引导域随机化解决单视图重建和域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中任意未见物体的6D姿态估计问题，特别是在3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度和生成模型与真实图像存在域差距的挑战性场景。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）粗到精对齐模块结合多视图特征匹配和渲染-比较细化来联合优化尺度和姿态；2）文本引导生成域随机化策略多样化纹理，使合成数据能有效微调姿态估计器。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的一次性6D姿态估计，验证了在实际操作中的实用性，为机器人长尾实例操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过对齐MLLM内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致模型在训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节

Method: 提出VIRAL方法，通过正则化策略将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型(VFMs)的表示对齐，从而保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识

Result: 实验表明该方法在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过消融研究验证了关键设计选择

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在MLLM训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发可扩展的细粒度评估工具，用于维护动态数据集中的主题相关性，所有代码和数据均已开源。

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

TL;DR: DischargeSim是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在出院沟通中的表现，重点关注个性化患者教育和多轮对话能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基准测试主要关注诊断推理，但忽视了出院后患者教育这一关键环节，需要专门评估模型在出院沟通中的能力。

Method: 通过模拟医生代理和具有不同心理社会特征的患者代理之间的多轮对话，在六个临床出院主题上进行评估，包括对话质量、个性化文档生成和患者理解度测试。

Result: 测试18个LLM发现出院教育能力存在显著差距，性能因患者特征而异，模型大小并不总能带来更好的教育效果。

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估LLM在临床后访教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持。

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动标注德国议会辩论中的（反）团结子类型，评估模型性能并分析二战后至今德国移民政策辩论中的团结趋势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注方法耗时且规模有限，需要探索LLMs在复杂政治文本标注任务中的自动化潜力，以深入研究德国移民辩论中的（反）团结模式

Method: 评估多种LLMs在标注德国议会辩论（反）团结子类型方面的表现，包括模型大小、提示差异、微调、历史与现代数据对比，并与数千个人工参考标注进行比较

Result: 发现LLMs在政治文本分析中具有很大潜力，数据揭示了战后时期对移民的高度团结以及2015年以来德国议会中强烈的反团结趋势

Conclusion: LLMs为政治文本分析提供了新机遇，德国移民辩论在人口衰退和劳动力短缺与日益极化的背景下具有重要意义，这些发现推动了进一步研究

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新的注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的key来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务中表现优于标准因果注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只编码前文信息，这限制了模型对完整上下文的理解能力。

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的key（称为lookahead keys），让早期位置的token能够整合后续位置的信息，同时保持自回归特性。通过数学等价性实现并行训练。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同规模的模型上都优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在多个下游任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: CASTLE通过动态更新key来整合后续信息的方法有效提升了语言模型的性能，为注意力机制提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 测试BVM方法在语言嵌入中判断图像状态变化的能力，并与现有方法进行比较

Method: 使用BVM方法在MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像，225个名词和115个形容词）上进行实验，分别测试名词状态分类和形容词区分能力

Result: BVM在名词状态分类上优于余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化、二进制索引、朴素贝叶斯和自定义神经网络等方法；但在形容词区分上不如逻辑回归模型

Conclusion: BVM在名词分类方面表现优异，但在形容词区分方面需要方法改进以提高准确性

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

Result: 在11个长文本数据集上验证，只需要16个训练示例即可有效预测多种质量指标

Conclusion: 提出了一个新题、有价值的基准和可实际部署的基线方法，为长文本生成质量预测推进了进展

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

TL;DR: KAMIR是一种基于模型内部表示的数据选择方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似度来评估数据，无需提示工程即可选择对训练有益的数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调中数据选择方法依赖提示工程、成本高且适用范围有限的问题

Method: 通过计算每层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据，基于模型对输入的熟悉程度选择训练数据

Result: 实验表明使用不太熟悉的数据训练能获得更好的泛化性能，且适用于多种任务类型

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效的数据选择方法，能够提升模型性能并降低训练成本

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

Motivation: 传转器自注意力机制存在局部化问题，注意力累出在少数token上，无法抓取长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出SAOBP（自注意力一步信忱传播）精炼框架，通过信忱传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入GTD（全局token依赖度）来量化多跳连接的相对贡献

Result: SAOBP能够阻止深层熵增的熵排冲，自适应地维持GTD在任务适宜水平，并在小规模模型中实现竞争性性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了自注意力局部化问题，特别在资源受限场景中显示出推理质量改善潜力

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同的社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达。

Method: 采用混合专家架构，结合人格适配器和动态路由网络，基于特质激活理论和Big Five人格模型实现情境化特质表达。

Result: 在多维度社交情感智能评估中显著优于基线模型，在下游人本应用（如心理健康咨询和客户服务）中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示与大型LLMs竞争性表现。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法，用于开发社交情感增强的LLMs，标志着向更人本AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

Method: 设计了一个新的实验框架，让LLM模型与只理解新构造语言Tinkatongue的机器人进行对话，评估其学习和使用新语言的能力。

Result: LLM模型在100次回复内无法成功建立对话，但显示出类似人类语言学习的特定策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM语言能力评估提供了新方向，并为设计能更有效从交互反馈中学习的模型开启了新途径。

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language

to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

TL;DR: 提出VeriOS-Agent，一个可信的操作系统代理，通过查询驱动的人机交互框架在不可信环境下主动询问人类，提高任务执行安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作系统代理主要针对理想化环境设计，而现实世界往往存在不可信条件，需要防止过度执行的风险

Method: 基于查询驱动的人机-GUI交互框架，采用两阶段学习范式训练VeriOS-Agent，使其在正常条件下自主执行，在不可信场景下主动查询人类

Result: 在不可信场景下平均步骤成功率比最先进方法提高20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展现出良好的合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信操作系统代理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型知识快速过时，重训练成本高，需要参数不变的知识编辑方法。现有RAG-based方法在简单知识编辑表现好，但在多跳问答中存在编辑跳过问题

Method: IRAKE方法：通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行迭代检索增强知识编辑，解决粒度不匹配和自然语言表达多样性导致的编辑跳过

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: IRAKE通过引导分解和迭代检索有效解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为参数不变的知识编辑提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BALI是一种新颖的联合语言模型和知识图谱预训练方法，通过同时学习专用KG编码器和对齐LM与图谱表示，将外部知识增强到语言模型中，提升生物医学文本理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物医学LLM对复杂领域特定概念结构和生物医学知识图谱中编码的事实信息理解有限，需要更好的方法来整合外部知识。

Method: 提出BALI方法：将生物医学概念提及链接到UMLS知识图谱，利用局部KG子图作为跨模态正样本，同时训练KG编码器并对齐LM和图谱表示。

Result: 在PubMedBERT和BioLinkBERT等领先生物医学LM上实施该方法，即使在小规模PubMed摘要对齐数据集上进行最小预训练，也能提升语言理解任务性能和实体表示质量。

Conclusion: BALI方法有效增强了生物医学语言模型对领域知识的理解能力，通过知识图谱对齐显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于迭代自提示技术(ISP)的临床病例文档摘要方法，使用大语言模型生成任务特定提示并通过少样本学习进行优化，在MultiClinSUM共享任务中取得了良好的语义相似度效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报告通常冗长且包含专业术语，使得领域专家难以高效识别文档中的重要信息，影响了医患之间的有效沟通和共享决策。

Method: 采用迭代自提示技术(ISP)在大语言模型上，通过生成任务特定提示和基于示例的少样本学习进行优化，同时使用ROUGE和BERT-score等词汇和嵌入空间指标指导模型微调。

Result: 在3,396份临床病例报告上的官方评估显示，使用GPT-4和GPT-4o的视角感知ISP方法获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERT分数(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，高BERT分数表明模型生成的摘要与参考摘要语义等价。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP方法(PA-ISP)可用于临床报告摘要，支持更好的医患沟通，尽管词汇重叠度较低，但语义相似度很高。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLoRAG是一个逻辑感知的检索框架，通过构建页面图来捕捉页面间的逻辑关系，结合语义和逻辑相关性进行多模态多页文档检索，显著提升了文档问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将文档转换为文本处理会丢失多模态信息，而大视觉语言模型输入尺寸受限无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接关系。

Method: 构建页面图捕捉页面间的上下文关系，使用轻量级视觉语言模型进行图遍历检索相关页面，结合语义和逻辑相关性。提供无需训练的解决方案和微调版本两种变体。

Result: 在四个文档问答数据集上平均准确率比LVLM直接推理提升9.68%，检索精度比基线方法提升7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过整合语义和逻辑相关性，有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的检索问题，显著提升了文档问答性能。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at
https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关系抽取中手动标注训练数据成本高的问题，以及LLMs在多分类设置下语义理解不全面和二元分类计算开销大的挑战。

Method: 使用三个模块：关系分组将相似关系聚类，关系提取模块处理每个关系组，标签决策模块综合两种分类方法的优势来生成高质量训练样本。

Result: 大量实验证实该框架能够从未标注文本中发现高质量的训练样本，提升关系抽取性能。

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLMs在关系抽取中的语义理解和计算效率问题，为自动提取训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

TL;DR: 医疗领域水印技术存在事实性风险，现有方法在低熵异设置下会容易减损医学实体的准确性，需要领域专门的水印方案来保护医疗内容的整体性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性成为关键问题。现有评测标准偏重检测质量的权衡，而忽视了在低熵异设置下的事实风险。

Method: 提出了一个医疗专门的评估流程，聚焦于事实准确性和连贯性的综合评估。使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，引入了事实性权重分数（FWS）这一组合指标，优先考虑事实准确性而非仅仅是连贯性。

Result: 评估结果显示，当前的水印方法在医疗领域导致事实性明显降低，熵异移动会容易造成医学实体表达的恶化。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了开发领域敏感垄水印方案的必要性，以确保医疗内容的整体性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

TL;DR: 本研究全面评估了不同大语言模型在检测虚假新闻、有害内容和政治偏见方面的性能，涵盖10个数据集和5种语言，比较了微调与上下文学习策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上虚假新闻、极化内容和有害信息的传播已成为严重问题，但缺乏对不同大语言模型在不同使用方法和语言下的性能基准测试。

Method: 使用10个数据集和5种语言（英语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语、阿拉伯语和保加利亚语），测试了参数高效微调和多种上下文学习策略，包括零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习（随机选择和多样性选择）以及思维链。

Result: 研究发现上下文学习通常表现不如模型微调，即使是较小的微调模型在任务特定设置下也优于最大的上下文学习模型（如LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct等）。

Conclusion: 微调在检测虚假新闻和有害内容方面比上下文学习更有效，强调了在任务特定场景下对较小模型进行微调的重要性。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Method: 构建包含60篇NLP领域完整论文的手动标注数据集，涵盖实体和关系标注；使用最先进的监督模型进行性能评估；利用训练好的模型自动构建NLP领域的细粒度知识图谱。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在不同长度学术文本上的抽取能力存在差异；与现有数据集相比，SciNLP在某些基线模型上实现了显著性能提升；构建的知识图谱平均节点度为3.2，表明具有丰富的语义拓扑信息。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个局限：1）忽视非结构化评论知识；2）未充分利用大语言模型(LLMs)。作者希望充分利用双重知识（结构化属性和非结构化评论知识）与LLMs来促进多模态任务导向对话系统中的文本响应生成

Method: 提出DK2R方法：首先从外部知识库提取结构化属性和非结构化评论知识；然后使用LLM通过分析生成的临时探测响应来评估每种知识类型的效用；最后分别通过专用推理总结意图导向的关键线索，作为增强LLM文本响应生成的辅助信号

Result: 在公共数据集上进行的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性

Conclusion: DK2R通过有效利用双重知识和LLMs，成功解决了动态知识类型选择和意图-响应解耦两个关键挑战，显著提升了多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成性能

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

Motivation: 解决小规模开源模型在文学翻译这一复杂任务中的性能问题，特别是为低资源语言如罗马尼亚语提供高质量文学数据集的需求。

Method: 采用两阶段微调过程：(i)指令调优以捕捉特定体裁的叙事风格，(ii)适配器压缩以实现高效部署；结合BLEU和基于LLM的五维度评估标准。

Conclusion: TF2提供了一个端到端、可复现的流程，用于研究成本效益高的翻译、跨语言叙事生成，以及在低资源环境中广泛采用开源模型处理具有文化意义的文学内容。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

TL;DR: 本文比较了人类标注者和大型语言模型对提示词修改的敏感性，发现两者都对标签集和标签格式的变化表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的敏感性低于LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类标注者是否也像LLM一样对指令变化敏感，以探讨LLM的提示脆弱性是否反映了人类标注的固有方差。

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对LLM和人类标注者使用相同的提示词变体进行系统比较，包括标签集替换、标签格式变化、拼写错误和标签顺序反转等修改。

Result: 人类和LLM都对特定类型的提示修改表现出脆弱性，特别是标签集和标签格式的变化。但人类判断受拼写错误和标签顺序反转的影响小于LLM。

Conclusion: LLM的提示脆弱性在一定程度上反映了人类标注的固有方差，但LLM对某些类型的提示修改（如拼写错误）比人类更敏感。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

TL;DR: Biased Tales数据集分析发现LLM生成的故事中存在显著的性别和文化刻板印象：女孩主角的外貌相关属性比男孩多55.26%，非西方儿童故事过度强调文化遗产和家庭主题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着家长越来越多地使用大型语言模型生成睡前故事，这些叙事中存在的文化和性别刻板印象问题亟待解决

Method: 创建Biased Tales数据集，分析LLM生成故事中主角属性和故事元素如何受到偏见影响

Result: 发现显著的性别差异（女孩外貌属性增加55.26%）和文化差异（非西方故事过度强调传统和家庭主题）

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了社会文化偏见在使创意AI使用更加公平和多样化方面的重要作用

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，无法有效激活LLMs的并行推理能力

Method: 提出强化学习框架Parallel-R1，采用渐进式课程：先用SFT在简单任务上培养并行思维基础，然后转向RL在困难问题上探索和泛化该能力

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准上实现8.4%准确率提升，并行思维早期作为探索策略，后期用于多视角验证，作为训练探索支架带来42.9%的AIME25性能提升

Conclusion: Parallel-R1成功培养了并行思维能力，验证了其作为训练探索支架的价值，能够解锁更高的性能上限

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

### [114] [Onset of vortex shedding in flow past Rankine ovals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07192)
*Zhaoyue Xu,Yi Liu,Hua-dong Yao,Shizhao Wang,Guowei He*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 研究通过直接数值模拟分析了Rankine橙形在黄性流中的流动特性，发现了无维参数Ua/m与关键齐数之间的线性关系，并确定了无维量学和经验公式来预测斯特鲁哅数和麻擦拉力系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rankine橙形作为潜流理论中的典型形状，在黄性流中的行为尚未被深入研究。虽然在无黄流中呈流线型，但在黄性流中表现为非流线型展体。研究旋激脱业的启动和相关流体动力学对理解这种过渡至关重要。

Method: 使用直接数值模拟方法，对黄性不可压缩流体穿越Rankine橙形进行了模拟，齐数范园为10到200，Ua/m参数范园为0到1。研究包括拉力和阻力系数、斯特鲁哅数的特征化分析，旋激形成分析，以及数据驱动的量纲分析。

Result: 发现Ua/m与关键齐数存在线性关系。通过量纲分析确定了控制斯特鲁哅数和麻擦拉力系数的无维量学和经验公式，这些参数仅依赖于齐数而与Ua/m无关。对于足够大的Ua/m值，压力拉力可以通过潜流解估算，从而可靠地预测总拉力而无需数值模拟。

Conclusion: 该研究系统地揭示了Rankine橙形在不同流动条件下的流体动力学特性，为理解这种经典形状在黄性流中的行为提供了重要见解。研究结果为预测旋激脱业启动和拉力特性提供了可靠的理论基础和实验公式。

Abstract: The Rankine oval is a classical geometry in potential flow, formed by
superimposing a uniform stream with velocity U and a source-sink pair separated
by distance 2a with strength m, resulting in a closed stagnation streamline
whose shape is governed by the dimensionless parameter Ua/m. Although the
Rankine body serves as a cornerstone for the classical theory of potential
flow, its behavior in viscous flow remains unexplored. The Rankine oval is
streamlined in inviscid flow but behaves as a bluff body in viscous flow. The
onset of vortex shedding is a critical phenomenon in flows past a bluff body,
mapping the transition from steady to periodic wakes. This study systematically
investigates the onset of vortex shedding in Rankine oval flows and its
associated fluid dynamics by performing direct numerical simulations of
incompressible flow past Rankine ovals over Reynolds numbers from 10 to 200 and
Ua/m from 0 to 1. The investigation reveals a linear relationship between Ua/m
and the critical Reynolds number. This study further characterizes the lift and
drag coefficients and Strouhal number, analyzes the vortex formation, and
performs a data-driven dimensional analysis. This analysis identifies the
dimensionless quantities and empirical formula that determine St and the
friction drag coefficient as a function of Re, independent of Ua/m. For
sufficiently large Ua/m, the pressure drag can be estimated using potential
flow solutions, enabling reliable predictions of the total drag without
numerical simulations. These conclusions collectively provide insights into the
fluid dynamics of Rankine ovals across diverse flow conditions.

Conclusion: 最优传输方法在复杂流场分析和解释中具有潜在应用价值，能够提取跨不同工况的通用物理关系，为流动控制评估提供新视角

Abstract: Quantifying differences between flow fields is a key challenge in fluid
mechanics, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of flow control.
Traditional vector metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, provide
straightforward pointwise comparisons but can fail to distinguish
distributional changes in flow fields. To address this limitation, we employ
optimal transport (OT) theory, which is a mathematical framework built on
probability and measure theory. By aligning Euclidean distances between flow
fields in a latent space learned by an autoencoder with the corresponding OT
geodesics, we seek to learn low-dimensional representations of flow fields that
are interpretable from the perspective of unbalanced OT. As a demonstration, we
utilize this OT-based analysis on controlled, separated flows past a NACA 0012
airfoil with a chord-based Reynolds number of 23,000 and a freestream Mach
number of 0.3 for two angles of attack of $6^\circ$ and $9^\circ$. For each
angle of attack, we identify a two-dimensional embedding that succinctly
captures the different effective regimes of flow responses and control
performance, characterized by the degree of suppression of the separation
bubble and secondary effects from laminarization and trailing-edge separation.
The interpretation of the latent representation was found to be consistent
across the two angles of attack, suggesting that the OT-based latent encoding
was capable of extracting physical relationships that are common across the
different suites of cases. This study demonstrates the potential utility of
optimal transport in the analysis and interpretation of complex flow fields.

Abstract: We investigated the low Prandtl number Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) system with a
melting top boundary under horizontal magnetic fields. This study is crucial to
gain physical insights into the melting dynamics of thermal storage systems,
which will help in controlling them. A three-dimensional solid-liquid phase
change Rayleigh-B\'enard system of gallium was numerically simulated using the
enthalpy-porosity method in a cubic domain. In the absence of a magnetic field,
the melting process was clearly divided into four regimes: conduction, stable
growth, coarsening, and chaotic regimes. We analyzed the flow and heat transfer
characteristics in each regime and established scaling relations for the
Nusselt number and liquid fraction. Under horizontal magnetic fields, a
quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) flow pattern was observed. We further examined the
effects of magnetic field strength on different melting regimes. With
increasing Hartmann number, a new flow mode emerged during the stable growth
regime. The results also show that the magnetic field alters the relative
duration of each melting regime in the overall melting process.

Abstract: In this work, we present a high-fidelity and efficient point-particle direct
numerical simulation framework based on a multi-block overset curvilinear grid
system, enabling large-scale Lagrangian particle tracking in complex geometries
with high-order accuracy and low computational cost. To handle the multi-domain
topological challenges inherent in such configurations, we develop an efficient
particle storage and redistribution framework leveraging overset grid
techniques. In particular, two optimization strategies have been proposed for
particle redistribution: one is an innovative inter-block mapping within
overlapping zones, and the other is a fast search-locate algorithm based on
particle velocity. Together, these approaches significantly reduce the particle
tracking overhead, especially for particles passing through interfaces between
overlapping grid blocks. Moreover, the accuracy and robustness of the present
framework are rigorously validated through various cases, including massless
particle trajectories, one- and two-way coupled simulations. Specifically, we
demonstrate the framework's applicability to the direct numerical simulation of
particle-laden flow in a linear compressor cascade at engine-relevant
conditions, showcasing its capability to resolve complex particle dynamics in
turbomachinery configurations with low computational costs.

Conclusion: 成功建立了液体驻波与机械振荡器之间的有效类比，揭示了不同物理系统间的深层数学联系，但类比存在一定局限性，需要进一步研究完善。

Abstract: We present an analogy between natural oscillations of the standing wave type
on a pool of liquid with an interface and a mechanical oscillator model. It is
shown that the equations of motion governing both systems have qualitatively
similar solutions - trivial as well as time-periodic with finite amplitude. The
time-periodic solutions can be linearly unstable in both cases depending on the
oscillation amplitude, thereby leading to interesting dynamics. Linear
stability results of both systems are discussed in detail; a novel Mathieu-like
equation is derived for the stability of the standing wave to a super-harmonic
perturbation and reinforces the analogy. Analytical predictions are compared
against numerical solution to the full nonlinear governing equations for both
systems. A good match is obtained in most cases with theory; mismatches are
further analysed and the limitations of this analogy is also pointed out.

Abstract: Groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer resting on a horizontal impermeable
layer with a boundary condition of a rapid increase in the source water level
is considered in this work. The newly introduced condition, referred to as the
backward power-law head condition, represents a situation where the water level
in the adjacent water body increases more rapidly than do conventional
problems, which can only represent a situation akin to a traveling wave under
rising water level conditions, given its consideration of infinite time. This
problem admits the similarity transformation which allows the nonlinear partial
differential equation to be converted into a nonlinear ordinary differential
equation via the Boltzmann transformation. The reduced boundary value problem
is interpreted as the initial value problem for a system of ordinary
differential equations (ODE), which can be numerically solved via Shampine's
method. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with Kalashinikov's
special solution, which is also introduced into the Boussinesq equation. We
find that the solution is consistent with the limit of the forward power-law
head condition. The new approximate analytical solution and the associated
wetting front position are derived by assuming that the solution has the form
of quadratic polynomials, which enables the description of the time progression
of a real front position. The obtained approximation is compared to Shampine's
solution to check the accuracy. Furthermore, the finite element method is
applied to the original partial differential equation (PDE), which validates
Shampine's solution for use as a benchmark.

Abstract: This study provides a carefully controlled examination of the universality of
the von Karman and additive constants associated with the classical logarithmic
scaling of the mean streamwise velocity profile in high-friction Reynolds
number (Re_tau) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) subjected to weak-to-moderate
adverse pressure gradients (APGs). The analysis leverages a recently developed
method for imposing APGs with minimal pressure gradient (PG) history effects in
Melbourne's high-Re_tau TBL facility (Deshpande et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, vol.
8, 2023), in combination with direct measurements of local friction velocity
via oil-film interferometry. The von Karman constant is found to remain
invariant within experimental uncertainty, while the additive coefficient
decreases with both the local APG and PG history, potentially explaining
reported variability in logarithmic scalings across the APG TBL literature. The
facility enables manual prescription of APGs along the full test section,
allowing weak PG history perturbations to be followed by extended recovery
regions, while maintaining matched local PG and Re_tau at downstream
measurement locations. This experimental configuration allows for systematic
decoupling of the effects of Re_tau, local PGs, and PG history, enabling
assessment of their individual contributions to single-point turbulence
statistics and energy spectra across different TBL regions. Present results at
high Re_tau show that PG history influences both small-scale and large-scale
motions in the overlap and outer regions, whereas local PGs primarily affect
the large-scales. The strongest effects of the local PG occur in the outer
region (around 0.4delta, where delta is the boundary layer thickness), while PG
history effects extend down to approximately 0.25delta, just above the
logarithmic region.

Method: 采用三维数值模拟方法，在封闭环形容器中研究离心对流，包含重力效应和无滑移的顶底边界条件，进行定量分析和理论推导。

Result: 发现Stewartson层仅在重力强迫超过临界值时出现，层厚度δ_st∼Ek^{1/3}，垂直速度振幅W_st∼Ek^{5/3}Ro^{-1}Ra_gPr^{-1}，理论预测与模拟结果在广泛参数范围内吻合良好。

Conclusion: Stewartson层是由重力诱导并通过旋转约束的地转平衡形成的，这些发现为离心对流系统中的湍流结构和传热机制提供了基础见解，具有理论进展和工程应用价值。

Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional numerical simulations on centrifugal convection
(CC) in a closed annular container, incorporating gravity and no-slip top and
bottom boundaries, to systematically investigate rotation-induced secondary
flow. The Stewartson layer, identified by an elongated circulation in mean
vertical velocity plots, emerges near the inner and outer cylinders only beyond
a critical gravitational forcing. Quantitative analyses confirm that the layer
thickness scales as $\delta_{st}\sim Ek^{1/3}$ due to rotational effects,
consistent with results from rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where $Ek$
represents the Ekman number. The internal circulation strength, however, is
determined by both gravitational buoyancy and rotational effects. We propose
that gravitational buoyancy drives the internal flow, which balances against
viscous forces to establish a terminal velocity. Through theoretical analysis,
the vertical velocity amplitude follows $W_{st}\sim
Ek^{5/3}Ro^{-1}Ra_gPr^{-1}$, showing good agreement with simulation results
across a wide parameter range. Here, $Ro^{-1}$ represents the inverse Rossby
number, $Ra_g$ the gravitational Rayleigh number, and $Pr$ the Prandtl number.
The theoretical predictions match simulations well, demonstrating that the
Stewartson layer is gravity-induced and rotationally constrained through
geostrophic balance in the CC system. These findings yield fundamental insights
into turbulent flow structures and heat transfer mechanisms in the CC system,
offering both theoretical advances and practical engineering applications.

Abstract: We investigate the vortical dynamics generated during the forced exit of a
circular cylinder through a quiescent free surface. While previous work on exit
flows has largely emphasized cavity collapse and force generation, the
formation and evolution of the starting vortex beneath the body have received
much less attention. Using high-speed particle image velocimetry at up to 2000
Hz, we isolate and track the primary vortex shed during exit. The body motion
is driven by constant vertical acceleration from rest, such that the cylinder
kinematics satisfy $v_{cyl}^2$ = $2$$\alpha$$\Delta$$y_{cyl}$, with $\Delta$
$y_{cyl}$ the displacement since release. This controlled protocol allows
systematic variation of the acceleration alpha while keeping the maximum
crossing velocity fixed. We characterize vortex trajectories, equivalent
radius, peak vorticity, and circulation, and compare across accelerations. The
results show that circulation growth collapses under the impulse-based scaling
$\Gamma / \sqrt(\alpha(\Delta y_{cyl})^3)$, independent of the imposed
acceleration. A consistent transition is observed as the vortex centroid
approaches the free surface, where its evolution is modified by surface
interaction. The trajectories remain predominantly vertical with only weak
lateral drift, robust across all accelerations. Taken together, these findings
establish a systematic framework for water-exit vortex dynamics under constant
acceleration and highlight scaling features that parallel the classical
starting-vortex problem in entry flows.

*Samvit Kumar,Simon Toedtli,Tamer A. Zaki,Gregory Eyink*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文通过分析Reτ=1000的平面平行槽道流数据库，验证了Lighthill提出的近壁面展向涡量集中湍流机制，并发现了反向流动对涡量输运的补充解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Lighthill提出的近壁面展向涡量集中的湍流机制，特别是在对数层中的涡量输运过程，以深化对壁湍流中涡动力学行为的理解。

Method: 使用Reτ=1000的平面平行槽道流数据库，计算基于远离或朝向壁面运动的平均流场，分析涡量输运的统计特性。

Result: 结果证实了Lighthill的机制在整个对数层都成立，并发现了反向流动可以解释平流与拉伸/倾斜引起的涡量输运的反相关性。研究还识别了两种涡结构：Townsend的发夹涡和项链状"披肩涡"，各贡献一半的涡量级联过程。

Conclusion: Lighthill的湍流机制在对数层得到验证，涡量输运是一个通过不同尺度涡旋的级联过程，存在强烈的向外和向内输运竞争，由发夹涡和披肩涡共同完成。

Abstract: We investigate Lighthill's proposed turbulent mechanism for near-wall
concentration of spanwise vorticity by calculating mean flows conditioned on
motion away from or toward the wall in an $Re_\tau=1000$ database of
plane-parallel channel flow. Our results corroborate Lighthill's proposal
throughout the entire logarithmic layer, but extended by counterflows that help
explain anti-correlation of vorticity transport by advection and by
stretching/tilting. We present evidence also for Lighthill's hypothesis that
the vorticity transport in the log-layer is a ``cascade process'' through a
scale-hierarchy of eddies, with intense competition between transport outward
from and inward to the wall. Townsend's model of attached eddies of
hairpin-vortex type accounts for half of the vorticity cascade, whereas we
identify necklace-type or ``shawl vortices'' that envelop turbulent sweeps as
supplying the other half.

TL;DR: 分布力元法方法，通过绿函数将边界压力表达为体积和表面积分组合，可识别激浪结构对分布压力的贡献


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统力元法无法识别激浪结构对分布力的贡献，为流动控制策略设计提供理论支撑

Method: 将Navier-Stokes方程投影到无散度空间，通过Poisson方程和绿函数表达边界压力，使用基础解方法和奇异值分解高效求解

Result: 在圆柱流中力的波动主要来自体积源，波动圆柱中惯性与体积源项可互相取消低升力波动，球体边界层中强负体积源创造低压区

Conclusion: 分布力元法方法能够有效分解和识别激浪结构对分布压力的贡献，为流动控制提供重要理论工具

Abstract: Quantifying the contribution of vortex structures to pressure stress is
useful for designing flow control strategies to mitigate low or drag. The
traditional force-element method focuses on the contribution of vortex
structures to the resultant force. However, the contribution of vortex
structures to the distributed force can not be identified. To address this
problem, a distributed force element method is proposed. This method projects
the Navier-Stokes equation to a divergence-free space and obtain a Poisson
equation for pressure. The Green's function is employed to express pressure
stress on the solid boundary as a combination of volume and surface integrals.
Contributions to the distributed source are divided into acceleration surface
elements, vorticity surface elements, convection volume elements. The method of
fundamental solutions and singular value decomposition are used to efficiently
solve the Green's functions. The distributed force element method is validated
using laminar flows around a stationary circular cylinder and oscillating
circular cylinder, and three-dimensional laminar and turbulent flows around a
sphere. In laminar flow over a circular cylinder, fluctuation of forces mainly
originate from volume sources, while in flow over an oscillating circular
cylinder, inertial and volume source terms may cancel out, suppressing lift
fluctuation. In flows over a sphere, a strong negative volume source in the
boundary layer on the sphere creates low-pressure regions, while pressure in
the separated shear layer is close to zero.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的机器学习框架成功结合了高精度模拟和低计算成本模型的优势，能够在保持计算效率的同时提供准确的风电场布局优化方案，为风电场设计提供了一种可靠且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to optimize wind farm layouts for maximum annual
energy production (AEP). The optimization effort requires efficient wake models
to predict the wake flow and, subsequently, the power generation of wind farms
with reasonable accuracy and low computational cost. Wake flow predictions
using large-eddy simulation (LES) ensure high fidelity, while reduced-order
models, e.g., the Gaussian-curl hybrid (GCH), provide computational efficiency.
We integrate LES results and the GCH model to develop a machine learning (ML)
framework based on an autoencoder-based convolutional neural network, allowing
for a reliable and cost-effective prediction of the wake flow field. We trained
the ML model using high-fidelity LES results as the target vector, while
low-fidelity data from the GCH model serve as the input vector. The efficiency
of the ML model to predict the AEP of the South Fork wind farm, offshore Rhode
Island, was illustrated. Then, we integrated the ML model into a greedy
optimization algorithm to determine the optimal wind farm layout in terms of
turbine positioning. The optimized wind farm layout is shown to achieve a 2.
05\% improvement in AEP over the existing wind farm.

Motivation: 解决非平面循环轮廓的湍流循环统计这一具有挑战性的问题，传统方法难以处理复杂几何形状的循环统计。

Method: 基于场论描述，使用标量顶点算子表示高斯相关涡旋结构的多重分形密度涨落，在最优弯曲空间中建模循环，并通过蒙特卡洛方法评估概率分布函数。

Result: 模型与广泛的直接数值模拟结果高度一致，证明了该方法的适用性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该模型成功处理了非平面循环轮廓的湍流统计问题，最小曲面在惯性范围内最优，但在小尺度下需要考虑次主导效应。

Abstract: We put forward a novel formulation of the vortex gas model of turbulent
circulation statistics to address the challenging case of nonplanar circulation
contours. Relying upon a field-theoretical description, statistical moments of
the circulation turn out to be functionally dependent on specific {\it{optimal
surfaces}} bounded by the circulation loops. Circulation is modeled in the
optimal curved spaces with the help of scalar vertex operators that represent
the multifractal density fluctuations of Gaussian-correlated vortex structures.
We show that minimal surfaces are optimal within the inertial range, but
subdominant deviations are expected to become significant for contours with
linear dimensions close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. As a case study,
we demonstrate the model's applicability through a Monte Carlo evaluation of
the circulation probability distribution function for a nonplanar contour,
which is in excellent agreement with results of extensive direct numerical
simulations.

Result: 开发了一种新的决策方法，能够有效处理可再生能源选择等复杂决策问题中的不确定性和模糊判断。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为处理不确定环境下的多准则决策问题提供了有效工具，特别是在可再生能源选择等具有技术和政策双重意义的复杂决策场景中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个全频谱神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板，在频谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和频谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了结合符号推理的可解释性和神经网络的可扩展性，开发一个能够在知识图谱上高效推理的统一框架，解决传统方法在准确性、推理速度和鲁棒性方面的局限性。

Method: 利用图信号处理和基于拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板。包含动态图和基学习、有理和扩散滤波器、频谱专家混合、证明引导训练、不确定性量化等扩展功能。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了一个可扩展且原则性的基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other

are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.

Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长时程动作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时仍存在困难，需要一种能够利用专家演示来解决这类挑战性工作流的方法。

Method: 给定单个演示，代理提取逐步指令并严格遵循用户意图轨迹执行，避免执行错误。使用验证器和回溯器模块来理解每个动作的结果并处理执行过程中的意外中断。

Result: 在OSWorld任务集上达到60%的成功率，而所有顶级代理都未能完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

Motivation: 皮肤神经活动(SKNA)作为交感神经系统活动的非侵入性指标，但容易受肌电(EMG)干扰，传统滤波方法在肌肉沉续活动时效果差

Method: 设计轻量化一维卷积自动编码器，结合LSTM瓶颈结构，使用认知压力实验的清洁SKNA数据和肌肉刺激录音模拟实际干扰，采用留一受试者交叉验证

Result: 信噪比提高9.65dB，相关系数从0.40提高到0.72，疯爆特征识别能力恢复到清洁水平(AUROC≥0.96)，基线与压力条件分类准确率达91-98%

Conclusion: 深度学习重构方法能在强肌电干扰下保留生理学相关的交感神经疯爆信息，为自然环境下的SKNA监测提供更稳健的技术支撑

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要改进

Method: 采用两种管道：1) 基于上下文学习的语言强化学习框架，使用开源和闭源大语言模型作为骨干；2) 思维链强化学习管道，使用小型骨干模型配合专门设计的奖励函数和两阶段强化学习

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA，Spider2.0-SQLite基准上verbal-RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的Text-to-SQL性能，混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Conclusion: BlendedNet填补了非常规构型气动数据的空白，为数据驱动的气动代理建模研究提供了重要资源和支持。

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于云的大语言模型在医疗监测中的隐私泄露、内存占用高和延迟问题，探索轻量级小语言模型在移动设备上的本地化部署潜力

Method: 系统评估SLMs在健康预测任务中的表现，使用零样本、少样本和指令微调方法，并将最佳微调模型部署到移动设备进行实际效率测试

Result: SLMs能达到与LLMs相当的性能，同时在效率和隐私保护方面有显著优势，但在处理类别不平衡和少样本场景时存在困难

Conclusion: SLMs尽管目前还不完美，但作为下一代隐私保护的医疗监测解决方案具有很大潜力

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对中间代币生成(ITG)机制进行了批判性研究，发现中间追踪长度与问题难度无明显相关性，而是更多受训练数据分布影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批判性检验中间代币生成是否真正反映问题难度，谨慎对待对语言模型"思考"过程的人类学化解释

Method: 使用A* 搜索算法的演绎追踪训练transformer模型，在平凡空间问题和分布外问题上系统评估中间代币序列长度与真实问题复杂度的关系

Result: 中间代币长度与A* 追踪长度仅呈松散相关，相关性主要出现在训练分布附近的问题中，表明是近似回忆而非真正问题适应性计算

Conclusion: 中间追踪生成并非适应问题难度，而是受训练数据分布影响，应谨慎解释长序列作为"思考努力"的标志

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Motivation: 受到AlphaEvolve的启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，需要将LLM代码进化能力扩展到完整的仓库规模，以解决更复杂的实际问题。

Method: 构建SATLUTION框架，协调LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器仓库，同时自我进化进化策略和规则，针对SAT竞赛代码库和基准进行进化。

Result: 从SAT Competition 2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中显著超越了人类设计的冠军，同时在2024基准测试中也超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: SATLUTION成功证明了LLM代码进化可以扩展到完整仓库规模，并在复杂算法问题上超越人类专家表现，为大规模代码自动进化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型发展面临的根本瓶颈——需要持续获取更多训练数据的问题，探索无需额外数据就能提升模型能力的方法

Method: 基于博弈论的自博弈框架，将模型能力转化为竞争游戏中的表现，通过让模型与自己博弈来产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct上的实验表明，预训练模型仅通过自博弈就能提升在指令跟随基准测试上的性能，且效果优于数据驱动的基线方法

Conclusion: 自博弈强化学习为语言模型提供了一条不依赖额外训练数据的持续改进路径，具有重要的研究和应用价值

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

TL;DR: SheetDesigner是一个零样本、无需训练的电子表格布局生成框架，使用多模态大语言模型结合规则和视觉反射，在离散网格结构中处理组件放置和内容填充，比基线方法性能提升至少22.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格具有丰富的结构化布局，但手动设计需要大量时间和专业知识。现有自动化布局模型不适合电子表格，因为它们忽略了电子表格的离散网格结构和独特的语义关系（如数据依赖性和上下文链接）。

Method: 提出SheetDesigner框架，使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），结合规则反射和视觉反射进行组件放置和内容填充。该方法为零样本、无需训练的方法，专门处理电子表格的离散网格结构。

Result: 在包含3,326个电子表格的数据集上，SheetDesigner在七个评估标准下表现优异，比五个基线方法性能提升至少22.6%。通过视觉模态，MLLMs能很好地处理重叠和平衡问题，但在对齐方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: SheetDesigner为电子表格布局生成提供了有效的自动化解决方案，证明了混合规则和视觉反射策略的重要性。该方法在保持电子表格特有语义关系的同时，实现了高质量的布局生成。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在可转移漏洞利用中发据关键作用，提出的框架有效提升了黑盒提示注入攻击的实用性和效果。

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架为解决组织LLM采用过程中的对齐问题提供了理论基础和实践指导，填补了现有研究的空白

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理后再符号推理的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图等不规则数据结构中。

Method: 扩展ProbLog引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层处理，支持多层神经符号推理。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Method: FTR框架：负反馈触发再生避免错误传播，LTM解码通过延迟序列评估实现多路径推理探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比最先进的提示式自校正方法取得了显著改进

Conclusion: FTR框架有效解决了LLM自校正的局限性，通过用户反馈触发和增强解码机制提升了模型性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

TL;DR: RIMO是一个新的数学奥林匹克竞赛基准测试，包含两个轨道：RIMO-N（335个整数答案问题）和RIMO-P（456个证明问题），旨在消除评估噪声并提供高分辨率的能力评估。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏见问题，如异构答案格式需要模型评分和依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案。

Method: 创建两个轨道：RIMO-N重写IMO问题为单一整数答案，实现确定性正确性检查；RIMO-P提供专家验证的证明问题，分解为子问题序列进行自动化评分。

Result: 测试10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现优秀，但在RIMO上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RIMO揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级别推理之间的巨大差距，为未来研究提供了具有挑战性且易于评估的基准套件。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework

Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境可持续性和气候变化问题严峻，但生命周期评估复杂且数据分散，需要更可访的碳踹迹估算方法

Method: 结合生命周期评估进展和公开数据库，使用知识增强AI技术（包括检索增强生成）估算食品从原料到出厂的碳踹迹

Conclusion: 该方法为提供可访问的生命周期评估见解带来潜力，但仍面临数据库不确定性和AI误解等限制

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)方法，通过critic模型动态评估推理置信度，在达到目标置信阈值时提前终止推理，平衡效率与可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)在解决复杂任务时使用固定的推理token预算，缺乏对推理充分性的动态评估，需要一种能自适应平衡准确性和计算效率的方法

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用critic模型定期探测自身推理状态，评估是否达到置信结论。未达到目标置信阈值时继续推理，达到时提前终止

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率同时减少token使用。64次多种子评估显示方法稳定，减少方差，在惩罚性评分下提升考试表现。可节省数百万token

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有力信号，CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署铺平道路

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较了矩阵基于检索和图基于检索两种RAG方案在教学问答中的性能，发现矩阵方案适合低成本事实检索，图基方案更适合主题性问题和数据完整性要求高的场景，建议采用动态分流框架优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术基于外部资源提高回答的可靠性。

Method: 使用新的EduScopeQA数据集（3,176个问题），测试矩阵检索和图检索两种RAG方案在不同学科、问题类型下的表现，并使用系统改动的教科书进行对比。

Result: OpenAI矩阵检索RAG在低成本事实检索中表现优异；GraphRAG Global在主题性问题中提供更丰富的教育内容；GraphRAG Local在数据完整性要求高的场景下准确率最高，但资源消耗高10-20倍。

Conclusion: 建议采用动态分流框架，根据查询类型路由到最优检索方法，以平衡效果和效率，为教育者提供可行的RAG-LLM集成指南。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM依赖于从专有模型精粳的大规模指令数据，成本高昂。需要找到一种方法减少对专有LLM的依赖，降低数据生成成本。

Method: 提出迭代自我精粳方法：1)通过少量优质样本增强小模型数据合成能力；2)设计多检查点采样和多方面评分策略获取多样化高质量数据；3)使用梯度基准影响估计方法筛选最关键样本。

Result: 基于小规模合成器生成的代码指令数据集，从DeepSeek-Coder微调的SCoder模型家族获得了最先进的代码生成能力。

Conclusion: 证明小规模开源LLM可以通过迭代自我精粳成为高效的数据合成器，有效减少对专有模型的依赖，为低成本高质量代码指令数据生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程虽然具有强大的问题解决能力，但其复杂的建模语言、大量的全局约束和建模技巧阻碍了非专家用户的使用。需要一种方法让非专家能够轻松获得专家级别的模型。

Method: 构建专家编写的模型数据库，通过自然语言描述检索最接近的源代码模型。系统自动匹配用户问题描述与模型库中的模型，无需人工数据标注。

Result: 实验显示系统在不同专业水平的用户问题描述下，都能以优秀的准确率检索到正确的模型。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo通过利用积累的专家模型资源，为约束编程的非专家用户提供了有效的建模辅助工具，显著降低了使用门槛。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

TL;DR: HiPhO是首个专注于高中物理奥林匹克竞赛的基准测试，提供人类对齐的评估，包含13个最新奥赛试题、专业评分标准和人类选手对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试缺乏对真实物理竞赛（如物理奥林匹克）的系统覆盖，且无法直接比较模型与人类表现。

Method: 收集2024-2025年13个国际和地区奥赛试题，采用官方评分标准进行细粒度评分，基于奖牌阈值将模型与人类选手对比。

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于铜牌水平；开源LLM偶尔获得金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；所有模型与满分仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在巨大差距，闭源推理模型物理推理能力强，但仍有很大改进空间。HiPhO为推进多模态物理推理提供了严谨的基准。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

Motivation: 研究者想要开发实验性方法来测量语言模型的神福感，以便更好地理解AI系统的认知状态咊神福主体性。

Method: 对比模型的言语偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为选择，测试成本咊奖励对行为的影响，并验证神福度量尺度在语义等价提示下的一致性。

Result: 观察到了说明的偏好与行为之间的可靠相关性，但不同模型咊条件下一致性程度有差异，并且对提示变动敏感。

Conclusion: 虽然不确定是否成功测量了语言模型的神福状态，但这些发现高亮了在语言模型中测量神福感的可行性，引领更远的探索。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过生成反事实样本和使用图神经网络来减少虚假相关性，提高检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络在源代码漏洞检测中容易学习到虚假的相关性，导致泛化能力差，需要解决训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成反事实样本，进行目标化的图神经网络训练，并利用基于图的解释性方法来识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION框架有效减少了虚假学习，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，为构建可信的AI网络安全系统提供了新方法。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 睡眠质量对健康有重要影响，医疗保健提供者和个人需要可访问且可靠的预测工具来进行预防性干预。

Method: 使用多尺度卷积层建模空间交互，循环层和注意力机制捕捉长期时间依赖，采用两阶段域适应策略（训练时适应和测试时无源适应）来增强泛化能力。

Result: 在5种输入窗口和5种预测窗口设置下均优于LSTM、Informer等基线模型，最佳性能为3天输入窗口和1天预测窗口，RMSE为0.216。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备稀疏数据实现个性化睡眠预测提供了鲁棒、自适应和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

Method: 构建GSTBench基准，在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估5种代表性SSL方法在多个目标图上的迁移性能，标准化实验设置以消除混淆因素

Conclusion: 掩码自编码器方法在跨数据集迁移方面具有优势，为图学习的"预训练-迁移"范式奠定了坚实基础，提供了指导未来可迁移图SSL研究的见解

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 整合人类知识和经验到交通预测模型中能显著提升预测准确性和鲁棒性，KGCM模型为多模态交通预测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Method: 框架采用YAML配置文件解耦实验与代码，支持库和仓库模型，并使用三层验证协议：张量级别接近度、激活对齐和任务级别指标。

Result: 在672次检查中，72.0%的运行通过，大多数差异出现在更严格的宽容度设置下。检测模型和编译后端更容易出现偏差，主要原因是非确定性后处理。

Conclusion: 该框架是首个统一的系统化方法，能够量化和减少深度学习中的跨后端潮流。确定性适配器和选择性回退机制可以显著提高一致性而不伤害性能，为异构运行时环境提供可复现的可靠部署方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Conclusion: 所提出的Kriging-HDMR主动学习方法有效解决了高维可靠性分析问题，通过多阶段子代理模型构建和优化采样策略，在计算效率和预测精度方面都取得了良好效果。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

TL;DR: 公交车达到时间预测方法NSATP，通过两阶段结构在提高预测性能的同时保留非稳态性特征，在德絡顿公交数据上显著降低了误差指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步预测中非稳态数据会降低模型性能，传统规一化方法容易导致过度稳态化问题，隐藏了非稳态性中的有用特征。

Method: 提出两阶段方法NSATP：1）序列稳态化提高预测性能；2）非稳态性效应恢复，将状态前沿方法从一维扩展到二维模型，学习缩放和偏移因子来补偿过度稳态化。

Result: 在德絡顿125天公交运营数据上，NSATP方法与基线方法相比，电车的RMSE、MAE和MAPE分别降低2.37%、1.22%和2.26%，公交车的相应指标分别降低1.72%、0.60%和1.17%。

Conclusion: NSATP方法能够在多步公交车到达时间预测中有效地平衡预测性能和非稳态性特征，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Motivation: 大语言模型在基础推理方面表现出色，但在需要与外部工具交互的任务中表现不佳，需要解决多轮工具使用的挑战

Method: 采用异步调用器、解耦工具/训练架构、奖励层支持多种评估信号，通过引入观察标记重建MDP，实现生成-解析-调用-更新的动态策略优化工作流

Result: 在Qwen3-4B模型上，Natural Questions数据集测试得分0.486，超越类似技术训练的更大模型(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO的0.473)，训练吞吐量提升6.8倍

Conclusion: RLFactory提供了一个低门槛、高适应性的框架，能够有效增强LLM在真实场景中的多轮工具使用能力

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在现实应用中部署时，确保解码时输出的安全性成为关键挑战，现有方法往往在安全性和响应质量之间做出严重权衡

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)实时安全监控的守卫模型；(2)带令牌缓冲区的回滚机制；(3)基于自省的干预策略，模型生成对先前输出的自我反思批判

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率方面达到优越平衡，有害响应率低，用户体验干扰最小，同时保持高响应质量

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确干预、及时修正和有效自我校正，实现了安全性和响应质量之间的优越权衡

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Method: 提出维度聚合策略重新加权LoRA更新，避免信息稀释；采用轻量级分层模型编辑方法选择性整合全局参数修复本地组件

Conclusion: FediLoRA有效解决了联邦学习中异构LoRA秩和缺失模态的挑战，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出lmKANs作为线性层的替代方案，通过可训练低维多元函数实现高维映射，显著提升推理效率与容量的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型中线性层占据大量参数和计算成本，需要更高效的替代方案

Method: 使用样条查找表实现的可训练低维多元函数来表达高维映射，每个函数包含数十到数百个可训练参数但计算成本低

Result: 推理FLOPs减少高达6.0倍，在甲烷配置数据集上实现10倍以上H100吞吐量提升，CNN中推理FLOPs减少1.6-2.1倍

Conclusion: lmKANs在保持MLP灵活性的同时显著提升推理效率，是线性层的有效替代方案

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

TL;DR: GyroBN是一个基于陀螺群结构的黎曼批量归一化框架，将欧几里得批量归一化扩展到非欧几里得流形数据上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的欧几里得归一化层不适用于流形数据，而许多机器学习中的黎曼流形具有陀螺结构，需要一种理论上有保证的黎曼批量归一化方法

Method: 提出了GyroBN框架，建立了伪约简和陀螺等距陀螺两个必要条件来保证样本统计的理论控制，并在七个代表性几何结构上实例化

Result: 实验证明GyroBN在各种几何结构上都具有有效性，且包含了多个现有黎曼归一化方法作为特例

Conclusion: GyroBN提供了一个理论上有保证的通用黎曼批量归一化框架，适用于具有陀螺结构的各种流形数据

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at
https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/GyroBN.git.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出TabGFM框架，通过将图数据转换为表格格式，利用表格基础模型进行零样本节点分类，在28个实际数据集上超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型在真实图数据上的泛化性能力有限，而表格基础模型在多个领域都表现出艰强的适用性。

Method: 将节点表示为表格行（特征、结构、标签信息作为列），通过特征和结构编码器转换图数据，使用多个表格基础模型对重采样表格进行预测，最后集成聚合结果。

Result: 在28个实际图数据集上，TabGFM正常地超过了任务特定GNN和现有最佳图基础模型。

Conclusion: 表格化重构方案为可扩展和可泛化的图学习提供了新的潜力。

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于系统论和合同论的方法，提出了有效信息一致性分数（EICS），用于量化Transformer电路的一致性和可信质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一种形式化的单次扫描方法来量化Transformer电路的一致性和可靠性

Method: 结合（1）基于局部雅可比矩阵和激活值计算的标准化合同不一致性，以及（2）基于同样的前向状态计算的高斯有效信息代理值，用于表征电路层面的因果出现

Result: 设计了一种白盒、单次扫描的方法，使得分数无维度且单元明确，并提供了实践指导

Conclusion: EICS为量化Transformer电路的一致性和可靠性提供了一种形式化的方法，但实验验证尚未完成

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

TL;DR: PLaID++是一个基于大语言模型的晶体结构生成方法，通过Wyckoff文本表示和强化学习优化，显著提高了稳定、新颖晶体的生成效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料发现过程缓慢且昂贵，需要加速新材料开发流程，特别是针对太阳能电池、电池和碳捕获等技术应用

Method: 基于Qwen-2.5 7B模型进行微调，使用Wyckoff文本表示法生成晶体结构，采用基于Direct Preference Optimization的强化学习技术进行属性引导

Result: 相比先前方法，生成热力学稳定、独特且新颖结构的成功率提高了约50%，在无条件生成和空间群条件生成方面分别实现了115%和50%的改进

Conclusion: 该工作展示了将自然语言处理的后训练技术应用于材料设计的潜力，为靶向高效发现新材料开辟了新途径

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

TL;DR: Fed-REACT是一个针对异构和演化客户端数据的联邦学习框架，通过表示学习和进化聚类的两阶段方法，在保持数据本地化的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端数据分布随时间演化且存在显著异构性导致标准算法性能下降的问题，同时应对高资源成本和隐私担忧。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段客户端学习本地模型提取特征表示；第二阶段服务器基于表示动态聚类客户端，协调集群级任务特定模型训练。

Result: 理论分析了表示学习阶段，实证显示Fed-REACT在真实数据集上实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Fed-REACT通过结合表示学习和进化聚类，有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性和数据演化问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

TL;DR: 量化加剧了模型对不同群体的性能差异，研究发现量化过程中权重和激活值的变化导致网络性能下降，特别是对少数群体的影响更严重。作者提出结合混合精度量化感知训练、数据集采样和加权损失函数来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现后训练量化(PTQ)虽然能高效压缩模型，但会加剧对不同群体(特别是少数群体)的性能差异，需要研究量化过程中的不公平影响机制并找到解决方案。

Method: 分析量化过程中权重和激活值变化对网络性能的级联影响，研究其对梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值的影响，提出结合混合精度量化感知训练(QAT)、数据集采样方法和加权损失函数的解决方案。

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加、群体准确率下降，对少数群体的影响更为显著，通过提出的方法可以有效缓解量化带来的不公平影响。

Conclusion: 量化会加剧模型对不同群体的性能差异，需要采用专门的公平性保护措施，如混合精度QAT与数据集采样和加权损失相结合的方法，才能实现公平的量化神经网络部署。

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a
standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3)
discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive

Motivation: 传统PINNs在解决逆问题时，每次面对新的观测数据都需要重新进行昂贵的训练过程，计算成本高昂，无法满足多查询场景的需求。

Method: 采用离线-在线分解策略：离线训练深度网络生成参数化微分方程解空间的基函数；在线冻结网络，仅训练轻量级线性输出层来同时重建解和识别参数。关键创新包括在线损失函数、前向模式自动微分和验证机制。

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为逆问题提供了高效的计算框架，通过元学习方法实现了快速推理，解决了多查询场景下的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于从紧凑模型到大型架构的各种场景。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用人口统计预训练模型(GDP)，专门针对年龄和性别特征进行表示学习，通过顺序排序策略和编码方法提升医疗预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口统计属性在电子健康记录中普遍存在且是重要的临床风险预测因子，但现有模型往往将其作为辅助特征，缺乏专门的表示学习方法

Method: 开发GDP模型，探索不同的排序策略和编码方法，将表格形式的人口统计输入转换为潜在嵌入表示，并在不同疾病和人群数据集上进行预训练和评估

Result: 顺序排序策略显著提升了模型在判别、校准和决策树分裂信息增益方面的性能，特别是在年龄和性别对风险分层贡献显著的疾病中表现突出

Conclusion: 面向表格人口统计属性的基础模型能够跨任务和人群泛化，为提升医疗预测性能提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedTeddi是一种面向联邦边缘学习的时序漂移和分歧感知调度算法，针对动态数据演化和通信资源限制，通过量化时序漂移和集体分歧来优化客户端选择和带宽分配，实现快速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中客户端数据具有时变和非独立同分布特性，现有研究大多假设静态数据集，需要一种能够及时有效适应动态数据演化的方法。

Method: 使用时序漂移和集体分歧量化数据动态特性，表示为类别分布的地球移动距离，提出新颖优化目标并开发联合调度和带宽分配算法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上相比随机调度分别提高了58.4%和49.2%的收敛速度，实现了更高的测试精度和更快收敛。

Conclusion: FedTeddi算法能够有效处理动态数据演化，在资源受限环境下实现快速模型适应，同时避免遗忘先前知识。

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

TL;DR: SBS是一种参数高效的方法，通过抑制频谱偏差来改进神经网络的神经表示，使用单向排序平滑和自适应傅里叶特征来提升重建精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的MLP在神经网络权重表示中存在明显的频谱偏差，难以有效重建高频细节，需要改进参数压缩效果

Method: 提出两种技术：1）单向排序平滑改善输出空间核平滑性；2）基于排序平滑的自适应随机傅里叶特征，根据层参数数量调制输入编码频率带宽

Result: 在多种ResNet模型和CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet数据集上的广泛评估显示，SBS以更少参数实现了显著更好的重建精度

Conclusion: SBS通过抑制频谱偏差，在神经网络权重表示中实现了参数效率更高的压缩和更好的重建性能

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection

creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where
the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of
EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF), we call it as EMORF-II. As it is
equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出DPH-RL框架，通过使用mass-covering f-divergences（如前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，解决RLVR微调中多尝试性能退化和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RLVR目标缺乏知识保留机制，反向KL散度会加速知识衰减，而无散度项则无法防止模型偏离其多样化的知识库。

Method: DPH-RL利用mass-covering f-divergences作为排练机制，通过持续参考初始策略来保持广泛的解决方案覆盖范围，使用生成函数计算f-divergence，仅需从初始策略采样而无需在线参考模型。

Result: 在数学和SQL生成任务上的实验表明，DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k退化问题，还提高了域内和域外的Pass@1和Pass@k性能，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 散度度量的正确选择是构建更通用和多样化推理模型的有力工具，为改进RLVR提供了一个关键但被忽视的维度。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅在性能上超越了现有方法，还能够识别出用户可能不会自然消费但会喜欢的内容，为推荐系统提供了更加丰富的预测信息

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提高短期水需求预测的准确性，同时为理解影响需求的确定性因素提供了更深入的见解

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Conclusion: RoseCDL为大规模信号中的罕见事件检测提供了一个实用且高效的解决方案，推动了CDL在异常检测领域的应用。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

Motivation: RLVR在提升大语言模型推理能力方面显示强大潜力，但训练中响应长度变化大导致梯度方差高和优化不稳定，现有方法存在估计偏差或梯度方差高的问题

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，将问题重新表述为寻找最小方差无偏估计量，提出ΔL归一化方法

Result: 在多个模型大小、最大长度和任务上一致取得优异结果，不仅提供无偏估计还能最小化梯度方差

Conclusion: ΔL归一化是简单有效的损失聚合方法，在RLVR框架中解决了动态生成长度带来的优化挑战

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Conclusion: 该框架为将不确定性感知组件集成到现代神经架构中奠定了基础，为判别性和生成性建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

Method: 引入PINN框架的双重公式化，包括强形式和变分（弱）形式，使用谱和神经网络基的测试函数，比较标准PINNs与变分PINNs(VPINNs)

Result: 强形式PINNs在受控设置中可能优于VPINNs，但对材料不连续性敏感且可能无明确诊断失败；VPINNs能直接处理分段常数材料参数但需要仔细选择测试函数

Conclusion: 双重公式化可作为收敛质量的可靠指标，将其集成到PINN框架中增强了在微观力学均匀化问题中的适用性

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

state-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that
includes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time
enhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了二元分类器在类不平衡情况下的性能，特别是在不使用重新平衡技术的情况下，并发现TabPFN和提升集成等先进模型在极端不平衡情况下保持了较好的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然有许多研究探讨重新平衡技术，但少有研究在不使用这些技术的情况下评估二元分类器的性能，特别是在医疗诊断和异常检测等关键领域。

Method: 系统性评估多种二元分类器在真实和合成数据集上的性能，逐渐减少少数类样本数量，使用一次学习和少量学习场景作为基准。通过合成决策边界生成模拟不同的数据复杂性，包括了过量采样、不足采样策略和单类分类方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究为不平衡学习中的模型选择提供了价值较高的指导，并了解了在不依赖明确重新平衡技术的情况下分类器的稳健性。

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成梯度(IG)方法假设数据是连续的，而图是离散结构，因此IG不适用于图数据解释。需要开发专门针对图数据的解释方法

Method: 开发了图集成梯度(GB-IG)方法，扩展了IG技术以适应图结构。在四个合成数据集上验证了方法识别关键图结构组件的能力

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification
tasks.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

TL;DR: IBN网络通过不确定性感知插值和双向建模，解决了多元时间序列预测中变量缺失问题，在多种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空图神经网络在处理缺失变量时难以建模变量间相关性，现有方法GinAR缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式。

Method: 提出可解释双向建模网络(IBN)，集成不确定性感知插值(UAI)和基于高斯核的图卷积(GGCN)，使用MC Dropout估计重建值的不确定性，并采用双向递归单元增强时间依赖性建模。

Result: 大量实验表明，IBN在各种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: IBN为具有缺失变量的多元时间序列预测提供了一个更可靠和可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 使用误差有界压缩算法压缩MoE模型中的非激活专家，减少GPU内存与主存间的数据传输开销，并分析不同层次专家压缩误差对推理准确性的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在有限GPU内存下的高效服务面临挑战，将非激活专家卸载到主存需要解决数据传输问题，需要探索高效的专家压缩方法并分析压缩误差对推理性能的影响

Method: 采用误差有界损失压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩非激活专家，在不同基准测试上进行广泛实验，全面分析不同层次专家压缩误差对整体推理准确性的影响

Result: 浅层专家（负责注意力机制和输入标记向量化）对压缩误差容忍度高；中间层专家（负责模型推理）的误差会显著损害推理准确性；深层专家（负责指令跟随和输出整合）的有界误差有时能提高推理准确性

Conclusion: 不同层次的专家对压缩误差的敏感度不同，需要针对不同层次的专家采用差异化的压缩策略，以实现内存效率与推理准确性的最佳平衡

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Conclusion: 提出的策略为个性化聚合药物屏幕提供了可行的早期决策路径，有助于更有效的个性化治疗选择

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Conclusion: 耳内电极作为一种低负担、舒适的睡眠监测方法具有巨大潜力，可用于开发如自动暂停媒体播放等消费级应用

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Conclusion: 模块化设计允许灵活替换适配性组件和集成多重预测器的辅助知识，实验结果证明了方法的有效性和适配性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into
numerical representations. Therefore, pre-trained models for popular knowledge
graphs and ontologies are increasingly valuable, as they spare the need to
retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used
biomedical ontologies. Given the dynamic nature of these ontologies,
Bio-KGvec2go also supports regular updates aligned with ontology version
releases. By offering up-to-date embeddings with minimal computational effort
required from users, Bio-KGvec2go facilitates efficient and timely biomedical
research.

TL;DR: ScaleZero：基于MoE架构和动态参数缩放策略的异构多任务学习模型，在保持单任务性能的同时仅需80%的环境交互步数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务世界模型在处理大规模异构环境时存在梯度冲突和模型可塑性损失问题，限制了样本和计算效率

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)架构缓解梯度冲突，并引入基于LoRA的动态参数缩放策略(DPS)来平衡计算负载

Result: 在Atari、DMControl和Jericho基准测试中达到与专用单任务基线相当的性能，且仅需80%的环境交互步数

Conclusion: ScaleZero展示了在大规模多任务学习中有效平衡性能和效率的潜力

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

Motivation: 解决多模态多任务基础模型在教育领域部署时面临的隐私法规、数据孤岛和领域特定数据有限的问题

Method: 整合联邦学习(FL)与多模态多任务(M3T)基础模型，构建M3T FedFMs框架，支持去中心化机构的协作隐私保护训练

Result: 提出了一个前景广阔但尚未充分探索的方法，能够推进下一代智能教育系统的三大关键支柱：隐私保护、个性化和公平包容

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs是教育领域有前景的研究方向，但需要解决机构间隐私法规异质性、数据模态特性不均等、模型遗忘、持续学习和可解释性等开放研究挑战

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

TL;DR: ACE方法通过自训练学习一致概念来解决完全伪相关导致的未指定问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异，且具有更好的可配置性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关敏感，现有方法主要处理不完全伪相关，但完全伪相关会导致泛化根本性未指定问题

Method: 提出ACE方法，通过自训练学习与训练数据一致但在新未标记输入上做出不同预测的概念集合，采用自信和选择性分歧策略

Result: ACE在完全伪相关基准测试中匹配或优于现有方法，对不完全伪相关保持鲁棒性，在语言模型对齐应用中表现竞争性

Conclusion: ACE在克服未指定问题方面取得显著进展，但仍存在重要限制

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力的低维投影会导致信息损失，且对所有输入对使用相同的评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖性计算偏置。

Method: 使用计算高效的高秩结构化矩阵（包括Block Tensor-Train和Multi-Level Low Rank矩阵）构建新的注意力评分函数。

Result: 在高维输入的上下文回归任务中，任何固定计算预算下都优于标准注意力；在语言建模中，MLR-based注意力相比标准注意力和滑动窗口注意力变体实现了更好的缩放规律；在长程时间序列预测中也显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于能够编码全秩或距离依赖性计算偏置的高效结构化矩阵家族，有效解决了标准注意力的显著缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Result: 学习率预热能持续加速梯度下降，在某些特定情况下比非递增学习率计划快Θ(T)倍收敛

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略在优化理论角度具有明确优势，新提出的广义平滑度假设为理解这一技术提供了理论框架

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

Conclusion: PeTTO方法有效地埋平了高性能计算与拓扑优化的间隔，为实际工程设计提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: We present a Pseudo-Transient Topology Optimization (PeTTO) approach that can
leverage graphics processing units (GPUs) to efficiently solve single-material
and multi-material topology optimization problems. By integrating PeTTO with
phase field methods, the partial differential equations (PDEs) constrained
optimization problem in topology optimization is transformed into a set of time
dependent PDEs, which can be analyzed using the knowledge of transient physics.
The sensitivities with respect to the design variable are calculated with the
automatic differentiation which help avoid tedious and error-prone manual
derivations. The overall system of equations is efficiently solved using a
hybrid of the pseudo-transient method and the accelerated pseudo-transient
method, balancing the convergence rate and numerical stability. A variety of
numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed PeTTO approach. These examples cover different
physics scenarios including mechanical and thermal problems, as well as
single-material and multi-materials cases in both 2D and 3D. The numerical
results show a 40- to 50-fold speedup when running the same PeTTO code on a
single GPU compared to desktop CPUs. This work helps bridge the gap between
high-performance computing and topology optimization, potentially enabling
faster and better designs for real-world problems.

Motivation: 传统ICE方法使用轻尾混合模型估计失效概率时收敛缓慢且不稳定，特别是针对极小的失效概率时表现不佳，且需要预先确定混合分量数量。

Method: 采用加权交叉熵惩罚的EM算法自动修剪冗余分量，并设计包含轻尾和重尾分布的两分量混合模型，以更好地探索尾部区域。

Result: 在各种测试问题上，Safe-ICE比标准ICE收敛更快，失效概率估计更准确，并能自动确定合适的混合分量数量。

Conclusion: Safe-ICE方法通过自动分量修剪和重尾混合设计，有效解决了传统ICE方法在极小失效概率估计中的收敛慢和稳定性问题。

Abstract: The Improved Cross-Entropy (ICE) method is a powerful tool for estimating
failure probabilities in reliability analysis. Its core idea is to approximate
the optimal importance-sampling density by minimizing the forward
Kullback-Leibler divergence within a chosen parametric family-typically a
mixture model. However, conventional mixtures are often light-tailed, which
leads to slow convergence and instability when targeting very small failure
probabilities. Moreover, selecting the number of mixture components in advance
can be difficult and may undermine stability. To overcome these challenges, we
adopt a weighted cross-entropy-penalized expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm that automatically prunes redundant components during the iterative
process, making the approach more stable. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
two-component mixture that pairs a light-tailed distribution with a
heavy-tailed one, enabling more effective exploration of the tail region and
thus accelerating convergence for extremely small failure probabilities. We
call the resulting method Safe-ICE and assess it on a variety of test problems.
Numerical results show that Safe-ICE not only converges more rapidly and yields
more accurate failure-probability estimates than standard ICE, but also
identifies the appropriate number of mixture components without manual tuning.

Abstract: We present an auxiliary space theory that provides a unified framework for
analyzing various iterative methods for solving linear systems that may be
semidefinite. By interpreting a given iterative method for the original system
as an equivalent, yet more elementary, iterative method for an auxiliary system
defined on a larger space, we derive sharp convergence estimates using
elementary linear algebra. In particular, we establish identities for the error
propagation operator and the condition number associated with iterative
methods, which generalize and refine existing results. The proposed auxiliary
space theory is applicable to the analysis of numerous advanced numerical
methods in scientific computing. To illustrate its utility, we present three
examples -- subspace correction methods, Hiptmair--Xu preconditioners, and
auxiliary grid methods -- and demonstrate how the proposed theory yields
refined analyses for these cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波数接近Dirichlet-Laplace特征值时，Steklov-Helmholtz特征值问题变得极度痴条，最低的特征值会发散到负无穷大，需要稳健的计算方法来解决这个数值不稳定性问题。

Method: 重构问题为Dirichlet-to-Neumann映射，使用间接方法基于单层假设，对离散单层矩阵进行降维奇异值分解，避免近例外波数时的痴条性。平滑域上进行谱收敛，曲线多边形上使用多项式分级网格。

Result: 方法成功移除了近例外波数时的痴条性，在多边形上达到10位数的高精度，在平滑域上达到任意精度。证明了碱优化中圆相对于适当缩放下的第二特征值的最优性。

Conclusion: 提出的BIO-MOD方法有效解决了Steklov-Helmholtz特征值问题在近例外波数时的数值不稳定性，并成功应用于谱几何研究和形状优化问题。

Abstract: We present a wavenumber-robust strategy for computing Steklov eigenpairs of
the Helmholtz operator $-\Delta -\mu^2$. As the wavenumber $\mu \rightarrow
\mu_D$ from below (where $\mu_D^2 $ is a Dirichlet- Laplace eigenvalue of
multiplicity $\ell$), the lowest $\ell$ Steklov-Helmholtz eigenvalues diverge
to $-\infty$. Computationally, the Steklov-Helmholtz eigenvalue problem becomes
severely ill-conditioned when $\mu \approx \mu_D$.
  We first reformulate the problem in terms of a suitably-defined
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We then use an indirect approach based on a single
layer ansatz. The discrete single layer matrix is nearly singular close to
exceptional wavenumbers, and we use a reduced singular value decomposition to
avoid the consequent ill-conditioning. For smooth domains, convergence of our
eigenvalue solver is spectral. We use this method (called the BIO-MOD approach)
for shape optimization of scale-invariant Steklov-Helmholtz problems and prove
that the disk maximizes the second eigenvalue under appropriate scaling. For
curvilinear polygons, we use polynomially-graded meshes rather than uniform
meshes. As a proof of concept, we also implemented BIO-MOD using RCIP
quadratures (using the ChunkIE implementation). The BIO-MOD approach
successfully removes ill-conditioning near exceptional wavenumbers, and very
high eigenvalue accuracy (up to 10 digits for polygons, arbitrary precision
accuracy for smooth domains) is observed.
  We deploy our approach to computationally study the spectral geometry of the
Steklov-Helmholtz operator, including some questions about spectral asymptotics
and spectral optimization.

Abstract: The block elimination with additive modifications (BEAM) method was recently
proposed as a alternative to LU with partial pivoting requiring less
communication. Because of the novelty of BEAM, the existing theoretical
analysis is lacking. To that end, we analyze both the numerical stability of
the underlying block LU factorization and the effects of additive
modifications. For the block LU factorization, we are able to improve the
previous results of Demmel et al. from being cubic in the element growth to
merely quadratic. Furthermore, we propose an alternative measure of element
growth that is better aligned with block LU; this new measure of growth allows
our analysis to apply to matrices that cannot be factored with pointwise LU. In
the second part, we analyzed the modifications produced by BEAM and the effect
they have on the condition number and growth factor. Finally, we show that BEAM
will not apply any modifications in some cases that regular block LU can safely
factor.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了凤卡洛积分中重要性采样的问题，适用于高维问题，为高维积分提供了一种有效的数值求解方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new importance sampling (IS) that is tailored to
quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration over $\mathbb{R}^s$. IS introduces a
multiplicative adjustment to the integrand by compensating the sampling from
the proposal instead of the target distribution. Improper proposals result in
severe adjustment factor for QMC. Our strategy is to first design a adjustment
factor to meet desired regularities and then determine a tractable transport
map from the standard uniforms to the proposal for using QMC quadrature points
as inputs. The transport map has the effect of damping the boundary growth of
the resulting integrand so that the effectiveness of QMC can be reclaimed.
Under certain conditions on the original integrand, our proposed IS enjoys a
fast convergence rate independently of the dimension $s$, making it amenable to
high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the artificial viscosity and hourglass
control algorithms for high-order staggered Lagrangian hydrodynamics(SGH), as
proposed in~\cite[Sun et al., 2025]{Sun2025High}. Inspired by the subzonal
pressure method in classical staggered Lagrangian hydrodynamics, we extend the
stiffness-based hourglass control algorithm to the high-order setting,
enriching the pressure field from the $Q^{m-1}$ to the $Q^{m}$ polynomial
space. A unified framework for this hourglass control approach is established,
from which the classical subzonal pressure method naturally emerges as the
special case of the $Q^1-P^0$ space. The artificial viscosity follows the
formulation in~\cite[Dobrev et al., 2012]{Dobrev2012High}. We show that the
viscosity admits a concise form, with intermediate variables explicitly
computable, leading to improved computational efficiency and easier
implementation. Moreover, the tensor viscosity in classical staggered
Lagrangian hydrodynamics can be derived in a similarly compact and explicit
form. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional problems are presented to
demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: We present the Physics-Informed Low-Rank Neural Operator (PILNO), a neural

framework, ensuring that PDE constraints and boundary conditions are satisfied
in both supervised and unsupervised settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness
on diverse problems, including function fitting, the Poisson equation, the
screened Poisson equation with variable coefficients, and parameterized Darcy
flow. The low-rank structure provides computational efficiency in
high-dimensional parameter spaces, establishing PILNO as a scalable and
flexible surrogate modeling tool for PDEs.

Motivation: M1辐射传输系统的非线性平衡定律需要确保数值解在物理可实现的凸集内，同时保持双曲性和物理可容许性。现有方法在处理这些约束时存在困难，需要开发一种既能保持物理可实现性又能达到高阶精度的鲁棒数值方法。

Method: 采用连续有限元离散化M1模型，构建低阶不变域保持(IDP)方法。通过引入表示齐次黎曼问题精确解的中间状态(bar states)，证明其可实现性。使用两步MCL算法：第一步对守恒变量施加局部限制以避免伪振荡和保持粒子密度正性；第二步约束矢量一阶矩的大小以实现物理可实现性。

Result: 开发出的通量校正有限元方案被证明具有IDP性质。数值测试验证了该方法在平滑区域能达到高阶精度，同时能有效防止非物理行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为放射治疗中的剂量计算提供了一个鲁棒的模拟工具，成功解决了M1辐射传输模型中物理可实现性和数值精度之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: We discretize the $M_1$ model of radiative transfer using continuous finite
elements and propose a tailor-made monolithic convex limiting (MCL) procedure
for enforcing physical realizability. The $M_1$ system of nonlinear balance
laws for the zeroth and first moments of a probability distribution function is
derived from the linear Boltzmann equation and equipped with an entropy-based
closure for the second moment. To ensure hyperbolicity and physical
admissibility, evolving moments must stay in an invariant domain representing a
convex set of realizable states. We first construct a low-order method that is
provably invariant domain preserving (IDP). Introducing intermediate states
that represent spatially averaged exact solutions of homogeneous Riemann
problems, we prove that these so-called bar states are realizable in any number
of space dimensions. This key auxiliary result enables us to show the IDP
property of a fully discrete scheme with a diagonally implicit treatment of
reactive terms. To achieve high resolution, we add nonlinear correction terms
that are constrained using a two-step MCL algorithm. In the first limiting
step, local bounds are imposed on each conserved variable to avoid spurious
oscillations and maintain positivity of the scalar-valued zeroth moment
(particle density). The second limiting step constrains the magnitude of the
vector-valued first moment to be realizable. The flux-corrected finite element
scheme is provably IDP. Its ability to prevent nonphysical behavior while
attaining high-order accuracy in smooth regions is verified in a series of
numerical tests. The developed methodology provides a robust simulation tool
for dose calculation in radiotherapy.

Abstract: This work describes models and numerical approximations that describe the
mechanical behavior of deformable continua with embedded structural members,
such as rigid bodies, beams, shells, etc. The continuum formulation extends an
idea first presented in the context of the Arlequin method and constrains the
kinematics of the two types of bodies to be compatible in the energy sense. In
the article, we exploit the shared similarities of all structural theories to
introduce a general framework for energetically coupling the latter with
continua. In addition, we show that the problems, as well as their finite
element approximations, are well-posed. Numerical examples of bodies with
inclusions, fibers, and embedded surfaces are provided to illustrate the
generality and robustness of the approach.

Abstract: We propose a novel sparsity enhancement strategy for regression tasks, based
on learning a data-adaptive kernel metric, i.e., a shape matrix, through
2-Layered kernel machines. The resulting shape matrix, which defines a
Mahalanobis-type deformation of the input space, is then factorized via an
eigen-decomposition, allowing us to identify the most informative directions in
the space of features. This data-driven approach provides a flexible,
interpretable and accurate feature reduction scheme. Numerical experiments on
synthetic and applications to real datasets of geomagnetic storms demonstrate
that our approach achieves minimal yet highly informative feature sets without
losing predictive performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Barrett-Garcke-Nurnberg (BGN) method for evolving
geometries under general flows and present the corresponding convergence
analysis. Specifically, we examine the scenario where a closed curve evolves
according to a prescribed background velocity field. Unlike mean curvature flow
and surface diffusion, where the evolution velocities inherently exhibit
parabolicity, this case is dominated by transport which poses a significant
difficulty in establishing convergence proofs. To address the challenges
imposed by this transport-dominant nature, we derive several discrete energy
estimates of the transport type on discretized polynomial surfaces within the
framework of the projection error. The use of the projection error is
indispensable as it provides crucial additional stability through its
orthogonality structure. We prove that the proposed method converges
sub-optimally in the L2 norm, and this is the first convergence proof for a
fully discrete numerical method solving the evolution of curves driven by
general flows.
