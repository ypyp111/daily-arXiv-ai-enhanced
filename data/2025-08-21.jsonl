To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a\nsleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs.

Post-training quantization\n(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language\nModels (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced\ngeneralization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a\n16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key\nmechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -\nclash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency."}

Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies.

We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a\nformal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles\nin memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems\nencode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling\ncontext-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive\nsystems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent\nmanifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of\ndelta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for\nMountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a\nlocal inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we\nestablish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:\nwhereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes\nbackward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient\ninference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI.

To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control.

This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework.

These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision.

However, their\ntheoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains\nunderexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a\ncontrolled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align\nwith our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical\nunderstanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,\nand provides practical guidance for designing effective models."}

To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects.

Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale\nvision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data\npoints and outperforms strong baselines."}

Objects of the\nsame class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further\naffected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the\nobjects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same\nimage. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium\ncanonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can\nbe easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted\nto a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet\nbenchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency\nacross four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT.

This study introduces an\ninnovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to\npeform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model\nrelational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our\napproach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or\nregions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the\nform of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant\nimprovement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several\nbenchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in\nscenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The\nexperimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential\nof integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification\ntasks.

First, we encode poses\nusing bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to\nimprove the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we\nintroduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic\nsimilarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,\naiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey\nrelevant semantic information.

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM.
