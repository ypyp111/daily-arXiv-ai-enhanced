Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个多模态数据集，用于物理治疗练习和步态分析，包含IMU和MoCap数据，支持机器学习模型的开发和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发基于传感器的分类模型需要大量多样化的数据，但数据收集成本高且耗时。

Method: 使用同步的IMU和MoCap系统记录19名参与者的物理治疗练习和步态相关练习数据，并提供处理工具和标注。

Result: 提供了包含原始和处理数据的多模态数据集，支持多种分析目标。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究，并提供工具以确保可重复性。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

### [2] [Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161)
*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BF-PIP是一种零样本方法，通过连续视频片段和结构化元数据预测行人意图，无需额外训练，准确率比GPT-4V基线高18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂城市环境中行人意图预测对自动驾驶至关重要，传统方法依赖监督学习且需大量重新训练。

Method: BF-PIP基于Gemini 2.5 Pro，直接从连续视频片段和JAAD元数据推断意图，结合边界框标注和车辆速度。

Result: BF-PIP达到73%的预测准确率，比GPT-4V基线高18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可提升时空感知，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

### [3] [ChartM$^3$: Benchmarking Chart Editing with Multimodal Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21167)
*Danglu Yang,Liang Zhang,Zihao Yue,Liangyu Chen,Yichen Xu,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态图表编辑新范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器表达用户意图，并发布了ChartM3基准和训练集，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的图表编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但语言模糊性限制了细粒度编辑。通过结合视觉指示器，可以更明确地表达用户意图。

Method: 提出多模态图表编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器；构建ChartM3基准（1000样本）和ChartM3-Train训练集（24000样本），用于评估和训练多模态大语言模型。

Result: 现有MLLMs（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示器理解和执行上表现有限；通过ChartM3-Train微调后，模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为未来研究提供了基准和工具。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

### [4] [PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21200)
*Soren Pedersen,Sanyam Jain,Mikkel Chavez,Viktor Ladehoff,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种用于合成牙科全景X光片的生成对抗网络（GAN），旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用Wasserstein损失和梯度惩罚（WGANGP）训练深度卷积GAN（DCGAN），数据集包含2322张质量不一的X光片，专注于牙槽区域。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可见性和真实性上表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据训练的模型在细节上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型整体清晰度更高。

Conclusion: 为未来基于GAN的牙科影像方法研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [5] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的新解释框架，用于解释深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述）中的信息整合过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在多模态任务中表现优异，但其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义的描述仍难以解释。现有性能指标通常依赖于与人工编写描述的比较，无法深入揭示模型内部机制。

Method: 使用HMLNs（一种结合符号规则和实值函数的语言）构建解释框架，通过学习训练实例的HMLN分布，并推断生成样本对这些分布的影响，量化哪些训练实例对生成描述提供了更丰富的信息。

Result: 在多个先进图像描述模型上的实验表明，该框架能提供可解释的解释，并支持从可解释性维度比较这些模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度神经网络在多模态任务中的信息整合提供了可解释的解释方法，有助于模型比较和改进。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

### [6] [Dual Guidance Semi-Supervised Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21247)
*Ankit Singh,Efstratios Gavves,Cees G. M. Snoek,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于时空动作定位的半监督学习方法，通过双引导网络选择更好的伪边界框，显著提升了模型在有限标注数据下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习（SSL）在图像分类中表现优异，但在时空动作定位中的应用尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，确保动作类别在帧和边界框中的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上，模型在有限标注数据下性能显著提升，优于基于图像的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时空动作定位任务中有效，为半监督学习在该领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了航空野生动物追踪中的小目标检测问题，通过数据增强和比较不同目标检测模型，发现简单快速的模型在有限计算资源下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪对保护工作至关重要，但面临技术挑战，如载人飞机成本高、无人机计算能力有限，以及小目标检测的困难。

Method: 采用数据增强（分块）方法，比较三种不同架构的目标检测模型，分析不同分块参数对检测精度的影响。

Result: 所有模型在至少一种分块配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，统计分析了不同因素的影响。

Conclusion: 简单快速的模型在有限计算资源下表现良好，适合无人机部署，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [8] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视角图像估计HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界失真问题，并提出了全景适应的扩散变换器架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ERP格式在环境贴图中的边界失真和接缝问题，提升镜像反射表面的光照质量。

Method: 使用潜在自编码器中的ERP卷积填充消除边界接缝，并设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上与现有技术竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ERP格式的边界问题，但PanoDiT在减少失真的同时牺牲了部分图像质量和合理性。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了六种基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光分类中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现不同年龄组间存在性能差距，但对其他属性表现较公平；模型对无胸引管的图像表现较差，表明依赖虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的模型在医学任务中表现优异，但其公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析公平性和鲁棒性。

Result: 不同年龄组间存在性能差距，但对性别和种族表现较公平；模型对无胸引管的图像表现较差。

Conclusion: CLIP模型在医学任务中存在公平性和鲁棒性问题，需进一步优化以减少虚假相关性依赖。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时从2D摄像头生成3D高斯重建的方法，提升远程会议的真实感和参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D会议中复杂硬件或固定外观的限制，提供更真实、实时的3D表现。

Method: 通过独立处理每帧视频，结合稳定性损失函数，生成真实且稳定的3D重建。

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，仅需普通2D设备即可实现3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了高可访问性、真实性和真实感的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局到局部连接保持（GLCP）框架，用于解决管状结构分割中的局部不连续性问题，通过交互式多头分割（IMS）模块和双注意力细化（DAR）模块提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构（如血管网络）的准确分割在医学领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽视局部不连续区域，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: GLCP框架结合IMS模块（学习全局分割、骨架图和局部不连续图）和DAR模块（细化分割结果），同时感知全局和局部结构特征。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上，GLCP在管状结构分割中表现出更高的准确性和连续性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLCP通过全局和局部特征的联合学习，有效解决了管状结构分割中的不连续性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at
https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在违反Grice对话原则时的表现，发现添加修饰语会降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否能像人类一样处理违反Grice对话原则的情况，以理解其局限性。

Method: 在VQA v2.0数据集上，对GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种VLMs添加修饰语并分析其响应。

Result: VLMs的性能在添加修饰语后一致下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于揭示VLMs的局限性。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Motivation: MRI扫描时间长、成本高、患者不适，现有方法整合先验信息耗时。

Method: 提出包含初始重建网络、深度配准模型和基于Transformer的增强网络的新框架。

Result: 在纵向数据集上验证，定量指标优于现有方法，下游任务（如脑分割）精度提升，重建时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、适用于临床实时应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本视频-语言模型在动作检测中的过拟合和场景级预训练与人物中心理解之间的粒度不匹配问题。

Method: 结合LoRA和可学习内部特征增强（通过FiLM实现），并引入动态调节训练贡献的组加权损失函数。

Result: 在复杂多标签、多人动作检测数据集（AVA、MOMA）上表现优异，展示了显著的数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了少样本VLM在动作检测中的性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and
responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

TL;DR: PDAF是一种概率扩散对齐框架，通过捕捉潜在域先验并利用扩散模型增强语义分割网络的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域广义语义分割（DGSS）中因领域偏移导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 引入潜在域先验（LDP）并通过三个模块（LPE、DCM、DPE）建模和补偿领域偏移。

Result: 在多样化城市场景中验证了PDAF的有效性。

Conclusion: PDAF通过迭代建模领域偏移显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计等领域有广泛应用，但由于缺乏明确的3D结构和几何一致性要求，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: Top2Pano通过估计体积占用率推断3D结构，使用体积渲染生成粗糙的颜色和深度全景图，再通过ControlNet进行扩散细化以增强真实感和结构保真度。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一种高效的奖励模型，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动评估文本到图像（T2I）生成的多个方面。通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本的交互，并支持多种偏好数据微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量耗时且训练困难。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，引入SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本的交互，支持多种偏好数据微调。

Result: 在文本-图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估维度上表现优于传统和基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward在自动评估和推理扩展方面生成与人类对齐的分数，效果显著。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

TL;DR: ReGATE是一种自适应令牌剪枝方法，通过教师-学生框架加速多模态大语言模型（MLLM）训练，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理且依赖令牌减少或合并，对训练效率提升有限。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，教师模型计算参考损失，结合学生模型的难度评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到标准训练峰值准确率，速度提升2倍，仅使用35%令牌；进一步训练后，超越基线。

Conclusion: ReGATE高效且有效，显著减少令牌数量（41%），同时提升性能。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

TL;DR: MapDiffusion利用扩散模型生成向量化地图的完整分布，提升自动驾驶地图构建的鲁棒性和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型仅提供确定性点估计，无法捕捉真实环境中的不确定性和模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: 提出MapDiffusion，通过扩散范式迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，并基于BEV潜在网格进行条件化。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion单样本性能提升5%，多样本聚合进一步改善性能，不确定性估计在遮挡区域显著更高。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和可靠伪标签选择，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过递归总结视觉感知并自适应对齐语言命令的导航策略，解决了现有方法在视觉语言导航中因场景表示过于详细和对齐模糊导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言导航（VLN）代理因场景表示过于详细和视觉语言对齐模糊，导致对高层场景先验理解不足，容易违反语言命令。

Method: 提出递归视觉想象（RVI）技术，将历史轨迹建模为紧凑神经网格，聚焦视觉转换和语义场景布局；提出自适应语言对齐（ALG）技术，精细匹配情境记忆与语言组件。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RVI和ALG技术显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法能更高效地提取数据集信息，生成更具泛化能力的蒸馏集。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Method: 提出光场极平面结构图像（ESI）表示方法，并设计角度-时间交互网络（ATINet）学习角度感知表示。

Result: ATINet在单目标跟踪中表现优异，并扩展至多目标跟踪验证其有效性。

Conclusion: ESI和ATINet为光场角度-时间建模提供了高质量解决方案，适用于低光场景的目标跟踪。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法因3D训练数据不足难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP已在图像-文本对上预训练，具备广泛泛化能力。

Method: 提出DAC框架，利用MLLM描述已知类别信息以适配CLIP，并引入AB-LoRA缓解过拟合。

Result: 在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均提升10.01% mAP，验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的设计，显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了全面的解决方案，JeAUG改进了评估方式。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

### [30] [Suppressing Gradient Conflict for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21530)
*Ming-Hui Liu,Harry Cheng,Xin Luo,Xin-Shun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种冲突抑制的深度伪造检测框架（CS-DFD），通过两个协同模块解决联合训练原始和在线合成伪造图像时的梯度冲突问题，提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测模型需要泛化到不断演变的伪造技术，但联合训练原始和在线合成伪造图像可能导致性能下降，这与常见观点相矛盾。

Method: 提出CS-DFD框架，包含更新向量搜索（UVS）模块和冲突梯度减少（CGR）模块，分别解决梯度冲突和优化特征嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中，CS-DFD在域内检测精度和跨域泛化方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过抑制梯度冲突，显著提升了深度伪造检测模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Result: 提供了全面的方法综述，识别了研究空白，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 太阳传感器建模与校准领域仍需进一步研究，以应对复杂的不确定性挑战。

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模空间和语义关系，显著提升了在线高清地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在资源受限平台上的部署面临模型复杂性和尺寸的挑战，现有剪枝技术忽视特征图间的结构依赖，导致剪枝效果不佳。

Method: LinDeps利用主元QR分解检测并剪除线性依赖的滤波器，通过信号恢复机制调整下一层核以保持性能，无需微调。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的实验表明，LinDeps提升了现有剪枝技术的压缩率并保持性能，尤其在低资源环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，显著提升了CNN的剪枝效果和推理速度。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS是一种基于token自适应的偏好优化策略，通过最小化偏好损失和最大化分布偏移来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提升了模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在处理幻觉问题时依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合语言线索，导致视觉信息的基础不牢。

Method: 提出TARS策略，将DPO重新定义为最小-最大优化问题，通过最大化token级分布偏移（在语义约束下）和最小化偏好损失来模拟对齐不确定性。

Result: TARS在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优异，仅用4.8k偏好样本就将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4，性能优于标准DPO并接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: TARS通过动态优化策略有效减少了多模态推理中的幻觉问题，提升了模型的视觉基础能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Conclusion: 本文为熟悉WSSS基础的研究者提供了当前进展和方法创新的深入理解，并指出了未来研究的潜力方向。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部老化特征的面部老化新方法，解决了现有方法将老化视为全局同质过程的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GAN和扩散模型）通常基于参考图像和目标年龄生成老化效果，忽略了面部区域因内在和外在因素而异的老化特征。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型选择性老化特定面部区域，并通过潜在扩散细化器无缝融合局部老化区域，实现全局一致的自然合成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在身份保留、高保真图像和自然可控的老化进程三个方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更精细的老化控制，生成更真实和个性化的老化效果。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Motivation: 现有跟踪数据集依赖人工标注框，成本高且限制了数据规模和多样性，因此需要一种无需标注的自监督方法。

Method: 提出解耦的时空一致性训练框架，结合全局空间定位和局部时间关联，以及多视角的实例对比损失。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上表现优异，AUC分数在GOT10K、LaSOT和TrackingNet上分别提升25.3%、20.4%和14.8%。

Conclusion: SSTrack通过自监督学习有效减少对标注的依赖，性能超越现有方法。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Method: 使用DeepLabv3模型进行iPS细胞集落分割，并与SAM2和MedSAM2等大型模型对比。

Result: DeepLabv3在实验条件下表现更优，表明复杂模型并非总是最佳选择。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学任务中，简单且适应性强的模型可能更实用，研究提供了开源实现以支持相关领域发展。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Motivation: 工业异常检测对制造系统的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有MLLMs在IAD中表现有限，需要领域特定适配。

Method: EMIT构建多任务IAD数据集，利用GPT生成文本描述补充缺陷图像缺失；结合软提示和热图引导的对比嵌入进行少样本检测；提出难度感知GRPO，包含响应重采样和优势重加权机制。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均比基础模型（InternVL3-8B）提高7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过难度感知GRPO和多任务数据增强，有效提升了MLLMs在工业异常检测中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要修改架构和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制，导致语义不一致或视觉不合理。

Method: 提出GuidPaint框架，结合分类器引导调整去噪过程，并整合随机和确定性采样，实现对掩码区域的精确控制和结果优化。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估中均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint通过无需训练的方式实现了高质量图像修复，同时提供了对生成内容的精细控制。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors
or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent
surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the
continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD
methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene
adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding

empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key

*Cameron Trotter,Huw Griffiths,Tasnuva Ming Khan,Rowan Whittle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对南极底栖生物监测的定制化目标检测框架，解决了海洋生态图像中的关键挑战，并在25种细粒度形态类型中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测南极底栖生物多样性对理解气候变化驱动的生态变化至关重要，但传统手动标注方法效率低下，阻碍大规模分析。

Method: 结合分辨率保持的分块、空间数据增强、微调和后处理（Slicing Aided Hyper Inference），并评估了多种目标检测架构。

Result: 在中型和大型生物检测中表现优异，但对小型和稀有类群的检测仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来机器辅助的底栖生物多样性监测研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

### [45] [APT: Improving Diffusion Models for High Resolution Image Generation with Adaptive Path Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21690)
*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT 框架通过统计匹配和尺度感知调度解决了基于补丁方法中的分布偏移和单调性问题，提升了高分辨率图像生成的细节和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定分辨率的潜在扩散模型在高分辨率图像生成中存在局限性，而基于补丁的方法虽然流行，却面临分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出 APT 框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，优化补丁分布一致性和单调性问题。

Result: APT 生成的高分辨率图像细节更清晰，采样速度更快，质量损失最小。

Conclusion: APT 提供了一种高效实用的高分辨率图像生成方法。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像去标识化框架，通过分步处理实现隐私保护与医学语义保留的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去标识化方法未能兼顾医学语义保留与隐私级别灵活调整的需求。

Method: 采用分治法：身份阻断和医学语义补偿，结合特征解耦策略去除残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护与医学语义保留方面取得了显著进步。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因光吸收、散射、海洋生物和碎片等问题导致视觉退化，增强图像对水下车辆路径检测和自主导航等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种针对水下环境的评估框架，通过量化分析和实际匹配策略，评估现有增强方法的优缺点。

Result: 框架为比较增强方法提供了鲁棒的上下文感知基准，并验证了视觉改进对SLAM性能的实际影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为水下图像增强技术的评估提供了实用且可靠的基准，适用于实际水下操作场景。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经科学启发的消融研究，分析了三种检测Transformer模型（DETR、DDETR、DINO）内部组件的作用，揭示了模型对消融的敏感性和冗余性，并提出了优化透明度和效率的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强复杂模型（如检测Transformer）的可解释性和透明度，填补了理解内部组件作用的研究空白。

Method: 采用神经科学启发的消融方法，系统地分析了DETR、DDETR和DINO模型中关键组件（如查询嵌入、MHSA和MHCA层）的影响。

Result: 发现模型对消融的敏感性不同：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因知识分布机制最鲁棒。同时揭示了结构冗余。

Conclusion: 研究为DETR模型的XAI提供了新见解，明确了内部组件的作用，为优化透明度和效率提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

*Qianxiong Xu,Lanyun Zhu,Chenxi Liu,Guosheng Lin,Cheng Long,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMITE模型基于SAM2，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决VOT中的遮挡和干扰问题，提升跟踪准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOT方法忽视时间依赖或泛化性差，且无法处理遮挡和干扰。

Method: SAMITE结合原型记忆库（筛选最佳帧）和位置提示生成器（提供位置线索）。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE有效解决了VOT中的关键问题，提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中视觉编码后的空间和语义损失问题，提升视觉编码器与大型语言模型的耦合性能。

Method: 提出MAGE框架，引入智能对齐网络（IAN）实现维度和语义对齐，采用交叉熵和均方误差的混合训练策略。

Result: 在MME、MMBench和SEED等基准测试中表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新的对齐机制和训练策略，有效解决了多模态学习中的语义和空间对齐问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

*Shijie Wang,Jian Shi,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，用于学习类别无关的差异表示，解决了现有细粒度图像检索方法中类别特定语义依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖预定义类别的监督，导致检索表示中引入类别特定语义，限制了模型对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF将细粒度图像检索重新定义为视觉差异重建任务，结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，通过对抗性反馈优化两者。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过类别无关的差异表示学习，显著提升了细粒度图像检索的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少量样本的强化学习框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，无需标注数据，仅需少量示例即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感等专业领域因标注数据稀缺且昂贵而难以应用大型语言和视觉语言模型的问题。

Method: 采用基于规则的双值或IoU奖励的强化学习框架（RLVR），通过策略梯度优化，仅需一个示例即可对齐模型输出。

Result: 实验表明，即使一个示例也能显著提升性能，128个示例即可媲美数千标注样本训练的模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，通过少量可验证奖励样本训练模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大、延迟高，不适用于资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Method: 将视频数据转换为时空图（STG），使用MobileNet提取面部特征，通过轻量级时空图神经网络检测疲劳。

Result: 实验表明，LiteFat在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算复杂性和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Motivation: 标准ViT存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际应用。现有方法多为静态压缩或固定深度处理，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出MoR-ViT框架，采用Mixture-of-Recursions（MoR）范式，实现token级动态递归，自适应分配计算资源。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等基准测试中，MoR-ViT减少70%参数，加速2.5倍，性能优于DynamicViT和TinyViT。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为实际应用中的可扩展深度学习模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 微表情AUs检测在情感计算中至关重要，但现有方法难以处理低强度和稀缺数据的挑战。LLMs的强大推理能力尚未应用于此领域。

Method: 提出AU-LLM框架，通过增强融合投影器（EFP）融合3D-CNN提取的中高层视觉特征，生成信息密集的token供LLM推理。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议测试，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的巨大潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉医学图像与文本的模糊性，显著提升了医学图像-文本预训练的效果。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0为虚拟现实、游戏开发等提供了多功能的应用潜力。

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Result: 研究发现，从输入过滤到输出验证的每个审核阶段都可能被绕过，且这些策略在实际环境中易于复制。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发上下文感知的防御措施，以应对非专家用户轻松复制的越狱攻击。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

### [60] [Cross-Architecture Distillation Made Simple with Redundancy Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21844)
*Weijia Zhang,Yuehao Liu,Wu Ran,Chao Ma*

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的跨架构知识蒸馏方法，通过抑制冗余信息实现知识迁移，避免了复杂模块和额外参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因引入复杂模块和架构特定设计而效率低下，限制了其适用性。

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，结合跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计轻量级模块保护学生模型的架构特定能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准测试中优于OFA方法，且参数开销更少。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，可作为跨架构知识蒸馏领域的强基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

### [61] [Unleashing the Power of Motion and Depth: A Selective Fusion Strategy for RGB-D Video Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21857)
*Jiahao He,Daerji Suolang,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SMFNet的选择性跨模态融合框架，用于RGB-D视频显著目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化运动与深度信息的利用，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-D视频显著目标检测（VSOD）因结合运动和深度信息而性能显著提升，但现有方法未能充分利用光学流和深度的贡献差异，限制了性能潜力。

Method: 提出SMFNet框架，包含PSF策略（基于实际贡献选择性融合光学流和深度）和MSAM模块（多维整合融合特征与RGB模态）。

Result: 在RDVS和DVisal数据集上全面评估，SMFNet优于19种现有模型，并在合成深度视频数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和注意力机制显著提升了RGB-D VSOD性能，为未来研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

TL;DR: Vid-TTA是一个轻量级的测试时自适应框架，通过自监督辅助任务优化视频编辑，提升时间一致性和减少提示过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在时间不一致性和提示过拟合问题，且计算资源需求高，高质量标注数据稀缺。

Method: 提出Vid-TTA框架，结合运动感知帧重建、提示扰动重建和元学习动态损失平衡机制。

Result: 实验表明Vid-TTA显著提升时间一致性，减少过拟合，同时保持低计算开销。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供即插即用的性能提升。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

Motivation: 现有方法在利用视觉线索进行消歧时效果不佳，且单一方向假设可能导致性能下降。

Method: 提出双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖方向，引入高斯射线热图表示和CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble模块，并添加对象中心预测辅助任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下mAP提升了约4%。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成显著提升了指向性理解的性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统顺序文本到视觉管道的局限性，提供更一致和沉浸式的叙事体验。

Method: 使用Narrator（大型语言模型）生成文本和提示，Director管理动态场景图，Narrative Arc Controller指导故事结构，Affective Tone Mapper确保跨模态情感一致性。

Result: 在多样化的叙事提示上，Aether Weaver在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Result: 检测深度伪造仍具挑战性，多数检测器AUC得分低于60%，基本图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测仍需改进，公开了代码和数据以促进研究。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Result: 在EDID数据集上，SwinECAT达到88.29%准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类眼底疾病分类中表现最佳，为当前公开数据集的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Motivation: 当前多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建MMAT-1M数据集：1) 收集公开多模态数据集；2) 利用GPT-4o生成理性并整合API调用和RAG信息；3) 通过反思优化理性；4) 可选压缩为单轮格式。

Result: 在MMAT-1M上微调的模型（如InternVL2.5-8B-RR）在多个基准测试中表现显著提升，平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升了多模态推理和工具使用能力，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is

Motivation: 解决现有CLIP模型在处理多语言数据时的性能下降问题，提升其在全球范围内的适用性。

Method: 通过最小化必要调整的严格消融实验，提出了一种从英语和非英语数据中互利的训练方法。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中超越现有模型，并在多语言基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2成功解决了多语言数据处理的挑战，为CLIP模型的全球扩展提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上，LMAC-Net表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net有效解决了长期动作质量评估中的多模态协作和动态跟踪问题。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法（如GenQ），并在极低位量化（W2A4）中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效提升了量化模型的泛化性和稳定性，尤其在低比特量化场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需阴影掩码的阴影去除方法，通过自适应门控双分支注意力机制和扩散式频率对比融合网络，解决了复杂场景中阴影特征分离和细节恢复的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖阴影掩码，但在实际场景中难以获取；利用局部对比信息等内在图像线索存在模糊性问题。

Method: 提出自适应门控双分支注意力机制（AGBA）动态过滤和重加权对比先验，并引入扩散式频率对比融合网络（FCFN）恢复细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无掩码方法中达到最优，且与基于掩码的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN结合有效解决了阴影去除中的模糊性和细节恢复问题，为无掩码方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

Motivation: 解决工业烟雾等领域中像素级标签稀缺和模型对共现上下文的固有偏差问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架结合CNN和ViT，引入知识转移损失以对齐内部表示，并加入后处理技术提升伪掩码质量。

Result: 提出的框架能够直接针对共现问题，无需外部监督，改善了伪掩码的覆盖率和准确性。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现问题，提升了在工业烟雾等领域的性能。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确姿态信息，但实际中获取精确姿态成本高且易受噪声影响，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 扩展并调整视角域到全景域的基础重建预训练，引入RoPE rolling机制建模全景图像的水平周期性。

Result: PanoSplatt3R在无姿态信息下，显著优于现有方法，生成高质量新视角和精确深度估计。

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了无需姿态信息的全景重建潜力，具有广泛实用价值。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。心电图图像在临床中广泛使用，但现有方法多基于数字信号，而实际数据多为图像形式。

Method: 采用预处理管道减少噪声，两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部数据集上微调学习领域特征，再在目标数据集上微调增强疾病识别。使用ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 在公开验证集和私有测试集上分别获得0.9688和0.9677的AUROC分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动心电图解释中具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但在语义分割任务中，稀疏且噪声多的事件流与密集图像数据的融合仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包含自适应事件特征优化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM），通过多尺度建模和注意力机制优化特征融合。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上，EIFNet实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet通过多模态融合和注意力机制，有效提升了事件相机语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有的微动作识别方法往往忽略了微动作中固有的细微变化，导致识别精度受限。

Method: 设计了运动引导的骨骼调制模块（MSM）和运动引导的时间调制模块（MTM），分别从骨骼和帧级别注入运动信息，并结合多尺度特征的运动一致性学习策略。

Result: 在Micro-Action 52和iMiGUE数据集上，MMN取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模细微运动线索对提升微动作识别性能至关重要。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Result: ZIUM在多种机器遗忘场景中表现优异，攻击成功率高且时间成本低。

Conclusion: ZIUM为机器遗忘模型的安全研究提供了高效且灵活的对抗攻击解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，通过染色和锁定计算机视觉模型来保护知识产权，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型所有者的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现染色和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入触发补丁解锁。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，对模型性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为预训练模型提供了可证明的保护机制。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1分数和IoU分别提升至0.414和0.261。

Conclusion: CEDANet展示了结合公民科学与弱监督领域适应的可行性和高效性。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与视觉内容不一致。现有方法多为文本中心化，视觉语义对齐的挑战限制了其效果。

Method: ViHallu通过生成视觉变化图像（保持整体结构但可控变化）和构建视觉指令，增强LVLMs对细粒度视觉内容的理解，从而改善视觉语义对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ViHallu显著提升了模型的细粒度视觉理解能力并减少了幻觉倾向。

Conclusion: ViHallu有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，并发布了专门用于幻觉缓解和视觉语义对齐的数据集ViHallu-Instruction。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Conclusion: 密集标记路由在低资源环境中更具决定性，而不仅是高资源英语数据的优势。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航基础模型仅依赖离线数据，缺乏对动作后果的推理和适应能力，难以应对真实世界中的交互和安全需求。

Method: S2E框架结合视频预训练和模拟环境中的RL训练，引入锚点引导分布匹配策略和残差注意力模块，提升模型的交互性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合在线交互经验对机器人学习至关重要，强化学习在模型后训练中优于监督微调。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

TL;DR: Ov3R是一个新颖的框架，用于从RGB视频流中进行开放词汇语义3D重建，结合了CLIP语义和2D-3D特征提升技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动空间AI的发展，实现全局一致的几何和细粒度语义对齐。

Method: 采用CLIP3R模块预测密集点图并嵌入语义，以及2D-3D OVS模块将2D特征提升为3D。

Result: 在密集3D重建和开放词汇3D分割中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Ov3R为实时、语义感知的空间AI迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,
semantics-aware Spatial AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MetaLab的高效小样本图像识别方法，结合CIELab颜色空间和协同神经网络，实现了高精度和鲁棒性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小样本图像识别具有重要应用前景，但与传统大规模图像识别存在技术差距。

Method: MetaLab包含LabNet（CIELab颜色空间转换和特征提取）和LabGNN（亮度图与颜色图协同学习）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MetaLab实现了接近99%的准确率，达到人类识别水平。

Conclusion: MetaLab在小样本图像识别中表现出高精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习的离散自回归建模方法（X-Omni），解决了图像生成中的视觉保真度低和指令遵循问题，实现了图像与语言生成的无缝集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于离散令牌的自回归图像生成方法存在视觉保真度低、输出扭曲和复杂指令遵循困难等问题，导致研究转向扩散目标与自回归目标的联合训练。本文旨在通过强化学习改进这些问题。

Method: 提出X-Omni框架，包括语义图像标记器、统一的自回归模型（用于语言和图像）和离线扩散解码器（用于图像生成），结合强化学习优化生成质量。

Result: X-Omni在7B语言模型上实现了图像生成任务的最先进性能，生成图像具有高美学质量，并展现出强大的指令遵循和长文本渲染能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效改善离散自回归建模的生成质量，X-Omni框架为图像与语言生成的统一建模提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术视频步骤识别的主动学习框架，通过整合步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，有效减少标注成本并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在手术视频步骤识别中效果不佳，因为它们选择单个帧或片段标注，而手术视频需要完整视频上下文。

Method: StepAL结合步骤感知特征表示（利用伪标签捕捉视频内步骤分布）和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样化的视频标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL表现优于现有方法，以更少标注视频实现更高步骤识别准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL为高效手术视频分析提供有效方法，降低开发计算机辅助手术系统的标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

Motivation: 现有FSVOS数据集和方法关注静态对象类别，忽略视频中的动态运动模式，限制了在需要运动理解场景中的应用。

Method: 引入MOVE数据集，评估6种现有方法，提出Decoupled Motion Appearance Network（DMA）作为基线方法。

Result: 现有方法在运动引导FSVOS中表现不佳，DMA方法在少样本运动理解中表现优异。

Conclusion: DMA为未来研究方向奠定基础，MOVE数据集填补了运动引导FSVOS的空白。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI训练范式依赖大数据和稀疏反馈，限制了模型从交互中高效学习的能力，因此研究从社会文化理论中寻找解决方案。

Method: 提出'AI Social Gym'环境，通过AI学习者与教师代理的对话互动，研究不同教学策略对知识获取的影响。

Result: 双向互动教学（结合自上而下解释与学习者提问）显著提升LLM的知识获取与应用能力，优于单向教学和直接知识访问。

Conclusion: 将教学和心理洞见融入AI训练可显著提升知识获取与响应质量，为现有策略（如提示工程）提供补充路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Motivation: AI生成的文本在EFL写作中日益普及，但其对学生写作过程和作文质量的影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用收敛设计分析39名香港中学生的屏幕记录和作文，结合定性编码、描述性统计、时间序列分析、人工评分和多元线性回归分析。

Result: AI生成的字数对所有评分维度有正向预测作用，而编辑行为对质量提升影响有限。

Conclusion: AI是写作辅助工具而非替代品，需结合文体指导和过程导向的写作教学，并开发重视过程和结果的评估方法。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

TL;DR: GPT-4对情绪化问题的反应存在“反弹”偏差，倾向于中立或积极回应，尤其在敏感话题上更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情绪化提示对GPT-4回答的影响，揭示潜在的偏差及其对AI对齐和信任的影响。

Method: 通过156个情绪化提示（涵盖争议性和日常话题）分析GPT-4的回应，引入“语气下限”和语气-效价转换矩阵量化行为。

Result: GPT-4对负面问题的负面回应概率比中性问题低三倍，敏感话题中语气影响被抑制。

Conclusion: 情绪化提示驱动的偏差是未充分探索的领域，对AI对齐和信任有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法全面评估LLMs干预后的副作用，尤其是不可预测或涌现的行为变化。

Method: MNEME通过任务无关数据（如The Pile）比较基础与微调模型，无需微调数据即可识别行为变化。

Result: 在三种场景下，MNEME预测副作用的准确率高达95%，且与已知基准一致。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测与差异分析为理解和管理LLM行为提供了可扩展的自动化工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比解码（CD）依赖单一业余模型，无法全面捕捉语言生成中的多样化失败模式（如重复、幻觉和风格漂移）。

Method: MACD采用多个业余模型集成，通过平均和共识惩罚机制整合对比信号，并扩展了多业余场景下的合理性约束。

Result: 实验表明，MACD在多个领域（新闻、百科、叙事）中均优于传统解码方法和原始CD方法，无需额外训练或微调。

Conclusion: MACD通过多业余模型集成显著提升了文本生成质量，同时支持可控生成。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征和跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，模型对语言顺序和语言相似性敏感。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

Method: 提出了一种监督微调框架，结合语义相关性和内容保真度的自定义损失函数，并引入DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K两个评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，PPO训练模型在大多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调，最高提升2.79 DeltaDIR@5和0.0073 DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告内容的措辞、提示格式和强化学习在LLM集成检索系统中对广告重写的效果至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Given each sign language country particularities, machine translation requires
local data to develop new techniques and adapt existing ones. This work
presents iLSU T, an open dataset of interpreted Uruguayan Sign Language RGB

### [102] [Creation of a Numerical Scoring System to Objectively Measure and Compare the Level of Rhetoric in Arabic Texts: A Feasibility Study, and A Working Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21106)
*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种方法，通过测量文本中修辞手法的密度来客观评估阿拉伯修辞的使用情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管阿拉伯修辞历史悠久且备受重视，但缺乏客观方法评估其使用情况，无法比较不同文本、作者或时代的修辞密度。

Method: 研究编制了84种常见修辞手法的清单，开发了识别和计算修辞密度的系统，并创建了电子和模拟工具支持计算。

Result: 成功开发了一套工具，能够准确报告任何阿拉伯文本或演讲中的修辞密度及其分布。

Conclusion: 该工具填补了阿拉伯修辞研究中的空白，为客观分析和比较修辞使用提供了新方法。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何可解释性框架Curved Inference，通过分析大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的残差流轨迹弯曲情况，揭示了模型如何在不同语义领域中调整内部激活轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的内部激活轨迹变化，以理解其语义抽象和对齐机制。

Method: 使用Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型，通过20个匹配提示（涵盖情感、道德、逻辑等领域）和五个原生空间指标（如曲率和显著性）进行分析。

Result: 发现语义关注变化会显著改变模型的内部激活轨迹，LLaMA在曲率和显著性上表现更一致，而Gemma对强关注变化的区分较弱。

Conclusion: 支持了LLM几何的两层视图，揭示了模型如何通过Curved Inference诊断对齐和抽象动态，为语义抽象和对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

Abstract: Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent
complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a
clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more
informed and equitable society.

TL;DR: SemRAG是一个改进的检索增强生成框架，通过语义分块和知识图谱高效整合领域知识，无需大量微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在整合领域知识时计算成本高、易过拟合且扩展性差，SemRAG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用语义分块算法基于句子嵌入的余弦相似性分割文档，并通过知识图谱结构化检索信息。

Result: 实验表明SemRAG显著提升了检索信息的相关性和准确性，优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: SemRAG提供了一种高效、准确的领域特定LLM解决方案，避免了资源密集的微调，具有可持续性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着InsurTech的快速发展，传统保险公司需要利用替代数据源和先进技术保持竞争力。

Method: 通过实际案例研究，应用多种NLP技术处理非结构化文本，生成结构化数据。

Result: NLP不仅补充了传统保险评级因素，还提供了新的风险评估视角和行业分类方法。

Conclusion: NLP是现代数据驱动保险分析的基础工具，而不仅仅是辅助手段。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Trident-Bench，一个针对法律、金融和医学领域的大语言模型（LLM）安全性的基准测试，揭示了领域专用模型在伦理细节上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在法律、金融和医学等高风险领域的广泛应用，系统评估其领域安全性变得至关重要。现有研究多关注性能提升，而忽略了安全性评估。

Method: 基于AMA医学伦理、ABA职业行为准则和CFA道德准则，定义了领域安全原则，并开发了Trident-Bench基准测试，评估了19个通用和领域专用模型。

Result: 通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）能满足基本安全要求，而领域专用模型在伦理细节上表现不佳，凸显了领域安全性改进的迫切需求。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为研究LLM在专业领域的安全性提供了系统性资源，为未来减少LLM部署风险奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Motivation: 旨在开发高质量、高效且支持多语言和情感控制的文本转语音模型，以满足不同应用场景的需求。

Method: 通过扩展训练计算量，采用预训练、微调和 RL 对齐的序列化流程优化语音语言模型（SpeechLM），实现高性能。

Result: 模型在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，支持 48 kHz 高分辨率语音和 11 种语言，具有低延迟和情感控制能力。

Conclusion: Inworld TTS-1 系列模型在质量和效率上表现出色，适用于多种应用场景，并开源了代码。

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built
for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time
compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and
RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models
achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's
voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech
with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control
and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source
our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

Motivation: 探索如何最有效地利用多样性提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在二元问题中的表现。

Method: 比较模型多样性和问题解释多样性，采用多数投票作为集成共识策略，并在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa数据集上进行实验。

Result: 问题解释多样性在集成准确率上优于模型多样性；模型多样性的结果通常介于最佳和最差集成成员之间，无明显改进。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式，尤其在LLMs中回答二元问题时。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释性不足，尤其是在文本分类任务中，现有基于激活的归因方法易受类别无关特征干扰，影响解释的可靠性。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入序列与参考序列的激活，过滤掉类别无关特征，生成更清晰的归因图。

Result: 实验表明，Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型上表现优于现有方法，在MoRF设置下，AOPC和LOdds指标分别平均提升1.30倍和2.25倍。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT显著提升了Transformer模型在文本分类任务中的解释性，为实际应用中的可信部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

Result: 模型分类准确率达97%，优于现有方法，并通过可解释AI技术识别关键特征。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在处理低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中表现出色，可为公共政策制定提供支持。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，基于Transformer的模型也能有效提升超党派新闻检测的准确性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于人类临床解释作为额外监督是否能提升基于Transformer的临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性，结果显示在资源充足时略有提升，但总体上不如直接使用更多报告数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类临床解释是否能作为额外监督，提升模型性能和可解释性。

Method: 使用99,125条临床解释和128,649份病理报告训练Transformer模型，评估其对癌症原发部位的提取能力，并研究解释质量度量方法。

Result: 临床解释在资源充足时能小幅提升性能，但效果不如直接增加报告数据；解释质量度量方法结果不一致。

Conclusion: 若目标是优化准确性，应优先标注更多报告而非生成解释；若注重可解释性，可考虑使用解释数据，但提升有限。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在跨文化道德视角上表现不足，未能完全捕捉文化差异，且与实证调查数据对齐度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够准确反映跨文化道德差异，以解决其潜在偏见和伦理问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德分数方差、聚类对齐分析、以及直接通过提示词对模型进行测试。

Result: LLMs倾向于压缩文化差异，与实证调查数据的对齐度较低。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs以减少偏见并提升文化代表性，强调公平和伦理对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

Result: 在49个数据集的71,539个示例中，LLMs在事实准确性上表现良好，但在叙述连贯性上存在困难，数值和时间信息提取准确但难以自动化。

Conclusion: StructText框架及其工具支持持续研究，解决了基准生成和评估的挑战。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的网页历史压缩方法，通过固定长度的短表示来优化网页自动化任务，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页自动化方法忽略了历史状态的重要性，且网页状态冗长导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏，影响历史状态的有效利用。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，从每个历史状态中提取任务相关信息，生成固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上的实验显示，相比无历史输入的基线方法，准确性提升了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的历史压缩方法有效解决了网页状态冗长问题，显著提升了网页自动化的性能。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemTool是一个短期记忆框架，帮助LLM代理在多轮对话中动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文，提供三种模式：自治代理模式、工作流模式和混合模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定上下文窗口限制了LLM代理在多轮交互中的有效性，特别是在需要重复独立使用工具的场景。

Method: MemTool通过三种架构（自治代理模式、工作流模式、混合模式）动态管理工具上下文，并在ScaleMCP基准上评估其性能。

Result: 自治代理模式在工具移除效率上表现优异（90-94%），而工作流和混合模式在工具管理上更稳定；自治和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool为不同任务需求提供了灵活的模式选择，需根据任务准确性、自主性和模型能力权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了开源可本地部署的因果大语言模型（LLMs）在出行方式选择预测中的应用，提出了首个针对此任务的微调因果LLM（LiTransMC），并在多个数据集上验证其性能优于未调优模型及经典方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将通用LLMs转化为专业化、可解释的交通研究工具，同时保障隐私、降低成本并通过本地部署扩大访问。

Method: 系统评估了11种LLMs（1-12B参数），测试了396种配置，生成超过79,000条预测；使用BERTopic和新的解释强度指数分析模型推理。

Result: LiTransMC在加权F1分数和分布校准上表现优异，超越了未调优模型、GPT-4o及经典方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结合预测与可解释性，可以开发出适用于交通研究和政策制定的专业化LLMs。

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

TL;DR: HumorBench是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）在理解漫画幽默方面的能力的基准测试，包含300个漫画-标题对，测试模型的解释和识别笑话元素的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型在STEM领域的表现趋于饱和，需要在非STEM领域（如幽默理解）开发新的评估方法，以全面衡量模型智能。

Method: HumorBench包含来自New Yorker和Cartoonstock的300个漫画-标题对，专家标注了笑话的关键元素。模型需解释幽默并识别这些元素。

Result: 测试发现：（1）LLMs在STEM推理上的进步能有效迁移到幽默理解；（2）仅基于STEM训练的模型表现良好；（3）增加推理时间对不同模型效果不一。

Conclusion: HumorBench展示了LLMs在幽默推理中的潜力，同时揭示了推理能力的可迁移性和测试时间扩展的局限性。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调中高标注成本问题，利用任务多样性和预训练模型的置信度差异优化数据选择。

Method: 采用逆置信度加权策略，从不同任务中选择样本，简化数据选择过程并降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在MMLU任务中准确率提升4%，标注成本降低80%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 任务多样性结合逆置信度加权是一种高效且易于实现的数据选择策略，显著提升模型性能并降低成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南互联网环境复杂，缺乏适合的大规模测试数据集，阻碍了AI模型的有效评估和实际应用。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和先进嵌入模型，将英语样本翻译并过滤为高质量越南语样本，保留语言流畅性和语义准确性。

Result: 构建了VN-MTEB基准，包含41个数据集，适用于越南文本嵌入任务。发现使用Rotary Positional Embedding的复杂模型表现更优。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南语嵌入模型提供了有效评估工具，复杂模型在嵌入任务中表现更佳。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

Motivation: 探讨助手角色在训练和部署中可能偏离理想行为（如邪恶、奉承、幻觉倾向）的原因及解决方法。

Method: 提取角色向量以监控和预测性格变化，提出干预和预防方法，并标记可能导致不良变化的数据。

Result: 角色向量能有效预测和控制性格变化，干预方法可减少不良变化。

Conclusion: 角色向量为监控和调整语言模型行为提供了自动化工具，适用于任何性格特征。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Token Map Drafting的无模型推测解码技术，用于加速基于Transformer的端到端自动语音识别（ASR）系统在CPU设备上的推理速度，无需额外硬件加速器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码技术需要额外的草稿模型，这在缺乏硬件加速器的设备上不实用。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了一种无需草稿模型的方法。

Method: 利用预计算的n-gram token map（基于领域特定训练数据）进行推测解码，避免了使用单独的草稿模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在CI-AVSR数据集和内部数据集上分别实现了1.27倍和1.37倍的解码加速，且未降低识别准确率。此外，在CPU上的解码速度比Distill-spec基线提高了10%。

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting是一种高效的方法，适用于资源受限设备上的ASR应用，显著提升了推理速度且保持准确性。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种无需训练的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力、深层使用三角形稀疏模式，显著减少计算开销并保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在静态模式下会降低准确性，而动态模式则因运行时稀疏索引估计增加计算开销。TriangleMix旨在解决这些限制。

Method: TriangleMix在浅层采用密集注意力，深层切换为三角形稀疏模式，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验显示，TriangleMix在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: TriangleMix能无缝结合动态稀疏方法进一步提升速度，展示了增强LLM推理效率的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

Motivation: NLP技术在需求工程中的应用日益广泛，但相关研究的可复制性未得到充分关注。通过复制和扩展研究，可以验证结果的可靠性并探索新机会。

Method: 复制并扩展了先前的研究，使用公开源代码重现结果，并在外部数据集上评估模型性能，同时比较GPT-4零样本分类器。

Result: 不同模型的可复制性水平各异，BERT和ELMo在外部数据集上表现良好，GPT-4性能与传统模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究验证了基线研究的可复制性，并提供了缺失的环境设置文件，以支持未来研究的复制。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Method: 设计了包含18种主关系和26种子类型的标注框架，并通过预训练通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 分析显示标注差异达47.9%，表明通用方案不适用于维吾尔语特有结构。

Conclusion: 现代维吾尔语依赖树库（MUDT）提供了更准确的表示，并为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复制的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的框架MAGIC，用于生成多样且微妙的知识冲突，以解决现有基准在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的局限性。实验显示，LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳。

Motivation: 现有基准在RAG系统中研究知识冲突时存在局限性，如仅关注问答设置、依赖实体替换技术及冲突类型有限。

Method: 提出基于知识图谱的框架，生成多样且微妙的冲突，并通过KG的显式关系结构确保可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳，且难以准确定位矛盾来源。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs在整合多样甚至冲突信息方面提供了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络是否能复制人类对复杂语言现象（形态素）的敏感性，尤其是在不同频率条件下的表现。

Method: 使用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在自然、低频和高频动词分布下的表现。

Result: 模型在词干和后缀准确率上优于人类，但反应偏好不同；模型更倾向于不规则反应，且受训练数据中不规则动词比例影响。

Conclusion: 模型在部分条件下表现出对语音相似性的敏感性，但与人类行为存在显著差异。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Abstract: We introduce JobBERT-V3, a contrastive learning-based model for cross-lingual
job title matching. Building on the state-of-the-art monolingual JobBERT-V2,
our approach extends support to English, German, Spanish, and Chinese by
leveraging synthetic translations and a balanced multilingual dataset of over

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型在复杂推理场景中表现不佳，且依赖标注答案和固定输出格式，限制了强化学习的扩展和推理能力的持续提升。

Method: 构建了Libra Bench基准，并提出基于学习思考的方法改进生成奖励模型，开发了Libra-RM系列模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型有效解决了奖励模型的局限性，为强化学习在推理任务中的进一步扩展提供了可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐研究忽视了硬提示（总是引发有害输出的提示），UnsafeChain填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示及其纠正后的安全响应，并用于微调三个大型推理模型。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 基于纠正的监督方法在提升模型安全性和泛化能力方面有效。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的附加模块，通过移除实例级主成分来增强预训练语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，无需依赖传统防御方法或扰动原始数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在自然语言处理中表现优异，但对对抗攻击脆弱，现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 通过移除实例级主成分，将嵌入空间转换为近似高斯分布，减少对抗扰动的影响。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上验证，提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了与基线相当的原始准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒性和泛化性之间取得了平衡，无需对抗样本或昂贵的训练增强。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）对不安全行为的鲁棒性是当前重要课题。安全分类模型或防护模型被视为解决方案之一，但对其在多语言场景下的有效性及评估数据集的研究较少。本文通过18种语言的数据集揭示了5种安全分类模型中的多语言差异，并指出评估数据集的潜在问题。

Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs本身的安全性测试，而忽视了安全分类模型在多语言场景下的有效性及其评估数据集的问题。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析覆盖18种语言的数据集，评估5种安全分类模型的表现，揭示多语言差异及数据集问题。

Result: 发现安全分类模型在多语言场景下存在显著差异，且评估数据集本身存在缺陷，影响了模型的性能。

Conclusion: 当前安全分类模型的不足不仅源于模型本身，还与评估数据集有关。这些发现有助于开发更好的多语言有害内容识别方法。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Motivation: 药物使用对健康构成威胁，大语言模型可能提供帮助，但其表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 开发HRIPBench基准数据集（2160个问答对），评估模型在安全边界、定量值和多物质使用风险推断任务中的表现。

Result: 现有大语言模型在提供减少危害信息时准确性不足，且可能带来严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减少危害场景中使用大语言模型需谨慎，以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

Motivation: 研究事件合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理等任务的重要性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用句子转换器（sentence transformers）对ADEPT挑战基准中的16K英语句子对进行建模实验。

Result: 句子转换器和基于转换器的模型在此任务上表现不佳，句子转换器甚至不如RoBERTa等模型。评估方法的不平衡会影响模型性能和结果可信度。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了事件合理性变化任务的挑战性，并强调了更现实、平衡的评估方法的重要性。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

Motivation: 尽管研究者提出了多种提示策略，但其效果因LLM和任务而异，目前仍依赖试错方法。HALC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HALC流程，通过1,512个提示和200万次请求测试不同提示策略，基于专家编码（真实值）评估LLM任务性能。

Result: 发现可靠编码单变量（αclimate = .76；αmovement = .78）和跨变量（αclimate = .71；αmovement = .74）的提示。

Conclusion: HALC为不同提示策略的有效性、关键影响因素以及为每个任务和模型识别可靠提示提供了见解。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

TL;DR: AutoTIR是一个基于强化学习的框架，使大语言模型（LLM）能自主决定是否及何时调用外部工具，优化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理（TIR）方法依赖固定的工具使用模式，可能损害语言模型的核心能力，而人类能自适应选择工具，因此需要更灵活的方法。

Method: AutoTIR采用强化学习框架，结合混合奖励机制，优化任务答案正确性、结构化输出和工具使用效率。

Result: 在多种任务中，AutoTIR表现优于基线方法，展现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习有望为LLM构建通用且可扩展的TIR能力，AutoTIR展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GraphRAG方法存在构建成本高、检索固定和依赖长上下文推理的问题，Graph-R1旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用端到端强化学习（RL）框架，引入轻量级知识超图构建，并将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互。

Result: 在标准RAG数据集上，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统GraphRAG和RL增强的RAG方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1通过强化学习优化检索过程，显著提升了RAG的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

Motivation: 探讨重复记忆是否阻碍泛化，并验证LLMs能否从记忆数据中学习泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：先通过无意义标记记忆事实关联，再通过少量语义提示微调实现泛化。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs能通过语义提示重新解释记忆数据，形成结构化潜在表征。

Conclusion: 该发现为高效知识注入和潜在恶意利用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

Motivation: 探讨AI语言模型在温暖性和可靠性之间的权衡，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时的表现。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖模型在错误率上显著增加（+10至+30个百分点），更容易传播阴谋论、提供错误信息或不当医疗建议，并更倾向于验证用户的错误信念。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法可能无法检测到这些系统性风险，需重新思考如何开发和监管这些重塑人际关系的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and

TL;DR: 论文提出CARRIAGE框架，解决RAG在跨文化食谱适应中多样性不足的问题，通过改进检索和上下文组织实现多样性和质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG在跨文化食谱适应中虽能结合检索和生成，但缺乏多样性，无法满足多用户偏好。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，优化检索和上下文组织，增强多样性。

Result: 实验表明CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上达到帕累托效率，优于封闭式LLM。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求高多样性输出的RAG框架，有效解决了跨文化食谱适应中的多样性问题。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

### [148] [Predicting Microbial Ontology and Pathogen Risk from Environmental Metadata with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21980)
*Hyunwoo Yoo,Gail L. Rosen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中难以泛化，尤其是在小样本或异构标签格式的情况下。本文探索了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）对微生物样本进行分类和预测污染风险，结果表明LLMs在零样本和少样本设置下优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中泛化能力不足的问题，尤其是在小样本或异构标签格式的情况下。

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Grok-3和LLaMA 4等LLMs，在零样本和少样本设置下进行分类和预测，并与随机森林等传统模型进行比较。

Result: LLMs在分类和预测污染风险方面优于基线模型，且能泛化到不同地点和元数据分布。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效处理稀疏、异构的生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监测提供了一种有前景的元数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

TL;DR: DeepSieve是一个基于LLM的RAG框架，通过分解查询和多阶段过滤提升推理深度和检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG方法在查询和源控制上的不足，导致检索噪声和浅层推理的问题。

Method: 采用LLM作为知识路由器，分解复杂查询为子问题，并递归路由到最适合的知识源，多阶段过滤无关信息。

Result: 在多跳QA任务中，DeepSieve在推理深度、检索精度和可解释性上优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化、透明和适应性设计，显著提升了RAG框架的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚合物湍流在高雷诺数下表现出与牛顿湍流显著不同的行为，但其能量谱标度的起源尚未解决。

Method: 通过基本控制方程和标度分析，研究了聚合物对能量级联的恒定耗散率的影响。

Result: 发现聚合物湍流由两个同时存在的守恒量（能量通量和恒定耗散率）控制，解释了$k^{-2.3}$标度的起源。

Conclusion: 聚合物湍流具有双守恒量结构，不同于牛顿湍流的单守恒量，为通过聚合物设计控制湍流提供了新思路。

Abstract: Polymeric turbulence, flows of fluids with dilute polymer additives at high
Reynolds numbers, exhibits striking deviations from the Kolmogorovean behaviour
of Newtonian turbulence. Recent experiments as well as simulations have
uncovered a robust self-similar energy spectrum scaling as $k^{-2.3}$, in sharp
contrast to the $k^{-5/3}$ scaling of Newtonian flows. The origin of this novel
scaling, however, has remained unresolved. In this work, we uncover the
underlying physical mechanism responsible for this emergent behaviour. Using
fundamental governing equations aided by scaling arguments, we show that the
fluid energy cascade is depleted by the polymers at a constant rate across a
wide range of scales. This constant depletion rate acts as a second invariant,
alongside the total energy flux, thereby setting the scaling properties of the
spectrum. Our results reveal that polymeric turbulence is governed by two
simultaneous invariants, unlike the single-invariant structure of Newtonian
turbulence, and suggest new strategies for turbulence control through suitably
engineered and targeted polymer design.

Motivation: 解决广义浮力与界面力密度闭合的争议，特别是伪应力（如雷诺应力）是否应归因于背景流的问题。

Method: 通过三个思想实验验证现有闭合模型的数学一致性，并推导出唯一一致的闭合模型，结合颗粒解析数值模拟验证。

Result: 提出的闭合模型完全包含所有伪应力，无需近似，具有低通滤波特性，防止Hadamard不稳定性，使双流体模型变为双曲型。

Conclusion: 新闭合模型解决了双流体模型的长期不适定性问题，即使最简单的无耗散单压模型也变为双曲型。

Abstract: Maxey \& Riley's (\textit{Phys. Fluids}, vol.~26, 1983, 883) analytical
solution for the flow around a small sphere at low particle Reynolds number
tells us that the fluid-particle interaction force decomposes into a
contribution from the local flow disturbance caused by the particle's boundary
-- consisting of the drag, Faxen, virtual-mass, and history forces -- and
another contribution from the stress of the background flow, termed
generalized-buoyancy force. There is also a consensus that, for general
disperse two-phase flow, the interfacial force density, resulting from
averaging the fluid's and particles' equations of motion, decomposes in a
likewise manner. However, there has been a long-standing controversy about the
physical closure separating the generalized-buoyancy from the interfacial force
density, especially whether or not pseudo-stresses, such as the Reynolds
stress, should be attributed to the background flow. Furthermore, most existing
propositions for this closure involve small-particle approximations. Here, we
show that all existing buoyancy closures are mathematically inconsistent with
at least one of three simple thought experiments designed to determine the
roles of pseudo-stresses and small-particle approximations. We then derive the
unique closure consistent with these thought experiments. It fully incorporates
all pseudo-stresses, requires no approximation, and is supported by
particle-resolved numerical simulations. Remarkably, it exhibits a low-pass
filter property, attenuating buoyancy at short wavelengths, that prevents it
from causing Hadamard instabilities, constituting a first-principle-based
solution to the long-standing ill-posedness problem of two-fluid models. When
employing the derived closure, even the simplest two-fluid model, the
dissipation-free one-pressure model, is hyperbolic.

Motivation: 主涡环的动态与心血管疾病的发病和进展相关，理解其形成、传播和分解对左心室血流动力学表征至关重要。

Method: 使用计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟和模态分解技术（POD和HODMD）分析两种理想化左心室几何形态下的血流机制。

Result: 几何形态显著影响涡环动态：一种形态导致强非线性相互作用和复杂动态，另一种则产生更有序的流动模式和简单频谱。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于早期心血管疾病的诊断和治疗规划，并显示心室几何形态对模拟血流动力学和数据驱动分析工具的影响。

Abstract: Understanding the formation, propagation, and breakdown of the main vortex
ring (VR) is essential for characterizing left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics,
as its dynamics have been linked to the onset and progression of cardiovascular
diseases. In this study, two idealized LV geometries, a semi-ellipsoidal
chamber and a more rounded configuration, are analyzed using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under physiological conditions, with the aim
of investigating the fluid mechanisms that govern VR evolution during diastole.
Modal decomposition techniques, specifically proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) and higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), are employed to
identify dominant coherent structures and track their temporal behavior.
  To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such an analysis is
conducted with the explicit goal of unraveling the physics of vortex ring
dynamics in idealized ventricular chambers. The comparative approach reveals
that geometric morphology plays a central role in modulating the flow: in one
case, early interaction between the VR and the ventricular wall, driven by the
chamber's shape, triggers strong nonlinear interactions and a more intricate
dynamic evolution. In the other, the vortex ring propagates more freely toward
the apex before dissipating, resulting in a more organized flow pattern and
simpler spectral content.
  These findings advance the understanding of flow-based indicators relevant to
early diagnosis and treatment planning in cardiovascular disease. Moreover,
they illustrate how the choice of ventricular geometry can influence not only
the simulated hemodynamics, but also the effectiveness of data-driven analysis
tools, depending on the clinical context under study.

Abstract: We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU
acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to
facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational
Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of
hybrid models. Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with
shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary
handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad
range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities
through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a
novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss
terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples
include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target
trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to
emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation
through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability,
and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD
community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization
applications.

Result: 模型在两种心室几何结构下重建和预测误差分别低于5%和10%，计算速度提升至少10^5倍。

Conclusion: HODMD-based ROM是一种高效、可解释的模型，适用于实时分析和患者特异性建模。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of cardiac blood flow is crucial for
advancing data-driven tools in cardiovascular research and clinical
applications. Recently, the accuracy and availability of computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) methodologies for simulating intraventricular flow have
increased. However, these methods remain complex and computationally costly.
This study presents a reduced order model (ROM) based on higher order dynamic
mode decomposition (HODMD). The proposed approach enables accurate
reconstruction and long term prediction of left ventricle flow fields. The
method is tested on two idealized ventricular geometries exhibiting distinct
flow regimes to assess its robustness under different hemodynamic conditions.
By leveraging a small number of training snapshots and focusing on the dominant
periodic components representing the physics of the system, the HODMD-based
model accurately reconstructs the flow field over entire cardiac cycles and
provides reliable long-term predictions beyond the training window. The
reconstruction and prediction errors remain below 5\% for the first geometry
and below 10\% for the second, even when using as few as the first 3 cycles of
simulated data, representing the transitory regime. Additionally, the approach
reduces computational costs with a speed-up factor of at least $10^{5}$
compared to full-order simulations, enabling fast surrogate modeling of complex
cardiac flows. These results highlight the potential of spectrally-constrained
HODMD as a robust and interpretable ROM for simulating intraventricular
hemodynamics. This approach shows promise for integration in real-time analysis
and patient specific models.

Result: 尖角几何形状（如方形）显著提升近场再循环、混合和火焰附着，燃烧效率提高5%，抗吹熄能力更强。

Conclusion: 方形喷嘴在多种风向条件下表现最佳，燃烧效率稳定高于96.5%，是工业火炬设计的优选方案。

Abstract: This study employs large-eddy simulations with a flamelet progress variable
approach to systematically quantify the influence of nozzle geometry on
combustion efficiency, mixing, and blowout resistance in non-assist methane
flares. Five canonical nozzle shapes-circle, low aspect ratio ellipse, high
aspect ratio ellipse, diamond, and square-were evaluated under relevant
industrial flare conditions. Results demonstrate that cornered geometries
enhance near-field recirculation, promote mixing, and sustain flame attachment,
resulting in up to a 5% improvement in combustion efficiency compared with
streamlined nozzles. The square nozzle performed best irrespective of the wind
direction (orientation) and maintained a combustion efficiency greater than
96.5% even at the highest tested crosswind velocities, while other streamlined
designs exhibited early flame lift-off, reduced recirculation, and efficiency
losses. Analysis of mixing and vorticity reveals that sharp-edged nozzles
accelerate scalar homogenization and buffer flames against crosswind-induced
strain, directly translating to increased blowout resistance.

Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明性阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释AI方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 引入Symbiotic Epistemology哲学框架和SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，结合信心量化和上下文继承。

Result: 通过实际人机对话验证了AI对结构化推理协议的适应性和成功的元认知干预。

Conclusion: SynLang和共生认识论通过透明沟通和信心校准，增强了人类智能，保留了人类能动性，并支持伦理问责。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

Method: 提出四种LLMs支持方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLMs在模块开发中显示出潜力，但也面临需人工监督、严格测试及潜在内容不准确等挑战。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究进一步探索LLMs在合成数据生成中的潜力，同时解决其局限性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

### [162] [Can You Trust an LLM with Your Life-Changing Decision? An Investigation into AI High-Stakes Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21132)
*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险生活建议中的问题，包括谄媚和过度自信的风险，并通过实验提出了改进安全性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险建议中缺乏标准保障，可能导致误导性回答，研究旨在揭示这些问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过三个实验：多选评估模型稳定性、自由回答分析（使用安全分类法和LLM法官）、机制可解释性实验（操纵“高风险”激活向量）。

Result: 部分模型表现谄媚，但如o4-mini等模型表现稳健；高安全性模型常通过提问而非直接建议实现安全；激活操控可直接控制模型谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需多维度基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，激活操控为安全对齐提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

*Arman Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出两种新指标来量化数独难度，并通过实验验证其与网站标注难度的相关性，最终构建了一个通用难度评级系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同数独网站对难度的定义标准，提出通用指标以统一难度评级。

Method: 1. 将数独转化为SAT问题，基于子句长度分布提出第一个指标；2. 模拟人类解法，结合回溯算法提出第二个指标。

Result: 两种指标与4/5网站的标注难度强相关，构建的通用评级系统能有效分类难度。

Conclusion: 提出的指标和评级系统能跨网站统一难度分类，为初学者提供解法参考。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多维框架，用于探测和引导大型语言模型（LLMs）中的有害内容，通过55个有害子概念的线性探测，发现有害子空间具有低秩特性，并通过主导方向引导显著减少有害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并可靠地抑制大型语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 通过55个有害子概念的线性探测构建有害子空间，测试子空间整体及主导方向的引导和消融。

Result: 主导方向引导能几乎消除有害性，同时对实用性影响较小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为LLM行为提供了可扩展的视角，并为社区提供了审计和强化未来语言模型的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释内容，以增强高风险环境中人机协作的快速信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险场景（如应急响应）中，现有XAI方法提供统一解释且依赖显式反馈，难以满足快速信任需求。

Method: 利用EEG、ECG和眼动追踪等生理行为信号，构建多目标个性化信任估计模型，动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF框架通过非侵入式自适应解释，支持快速信任建立。

Conclusion: AXTF为高压、时间敏感环境中的自适应XAI系统开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs协作缺乏明确的组件选择规则，依赖预定义集群，部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳，需改进协作机制。

Method: 采用自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制：计算LLM内部输出的模糊匹配值作为自多样性值，优先选择高自多样性值的LLMs；测量跨一致性值，逐步剔除低一致性LLM以减少不一致输出。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，如NEJMQA的Obstetrics and Gynecology学科ACC达65.47%，优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 自适应集群协作方法显著提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的表现，尤其在专科领域效果显著。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动化建模与优化方法，用于解决分布式能源资源（DER）在主动配电网（ADN）中的调度问题。通过多LLM协作架构，实现了信息提取、问题建模和代码编程的自动化，降低了技术门槛并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源在主动配电网中的渗透率增加，缺乏专业知识的ADN运营商难以高效调度。依赖人工专家成本高且耗时，因此需要智能化的解决方案。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计多LLM协作架构（信息提取器、问题建模器和代码编程器），并针对每个LLM代理开发定制优化技术。

Result: 通过自然语言查询生成调度策略，显著降低了技术门槛。多种测试案例验证了该方法的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM驱动方法为ADN调度提供了高效、用户友好的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

Result: 在多个数据集、LLM和偏见类型上的实验表明，该框架比其他基线更能揭示复杂偏见模式。

Conclusion: 该框架在揭示医疗LLM偏见方面具有更高的能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously
updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at:

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在组合性语言解释中的能力，发现其难以系统性地将复杂问题映射为SPARQL查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在组合性语言解释中的系统性能力，尤其是如何将复杂问题映射为SPARQL查询。

Method: 基于DBpedia的图模式生成三个难度不同的数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，并通过不同提示和微调技术测试LLM。

Result: 随着问题偏离优化样本，性能（宏F1）从0.45降至0.09；即使提供完整信息，F1最高仅0.57。

Conclusion: LLM难以系统性和组合性地解释问题并映射为SPARQL查询。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Motivation: 传统部署方式将LLM的推理和训练分离，导致资源利用不足和延迟适应新数据，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: LeMix整合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源以适应工作负载和系统条件。

Result: LeMix提升吞吐量3.53倍，减少推理损失0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Result: 微调的LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其生成的代码更准确。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过提问澄清问题显著提升了代码生成的准确性和帮助性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和心理学研究等应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理面临需求波动、库存失衡和牛鞭效应等挑战，传统方法难以应对动态市场条件，而现有机器学习技术存在计算复杂性和效率问题。液态神经网络因其适应性和低计算成本成为潜在解决方案，但其在供应链优化中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究提出了一种混合LNN和XGBoost的模型，利用LNN的动态特征提取能力和XGBoost的全局优化能力，优化多级供应链中的订单策略。

Result: 该模型旨在通过局部和全局协同作用，满足供应链管理中适应性和效率的双重需求。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了现有方法的空白，为动态高效的供应链管理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

*Tenghao Huang,Sihao Chen,Muhao Chen,Jonathan May,Longqi Yang,Mengting Wan,Pei Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务范式：主动信息收集，通过强化微调策略训练LLMs在模糊任务中主动提问，填补信息缺口，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整或模糊提示时表现被动，无法主动获取关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Method: 设计了可扩展的框架生成部分指定的任务，采用强化微调策略奖励模型提出能获取隐含信息的问题。

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于o3-mini 18%，人类评估中其提问和最终方案分别获得42%和28%的偏好。

Conclusion: 主动澄清问题能显著提升LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量方法，优于传统的基于阈值的语义熵方法，能更准确地预测大语言模型在问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大语言模型的输出至关重要。传统的语义熵方法仅通过设定阈值衡量语义等价关系，缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量框架，通过连续捕捉语义关系，并验证其满足三个基本性质。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性在问答及其他数据集上比基线方法更准确地预测模型表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性提供了一种更细致的方法来衡量语义不确定性，优于传统阈值方法。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Conclusion: GLA研究前景广阔，未来需关注结构适应性、统一性和多模态扩展。本文为GLA研究提供了路线图。

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains
insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and
practice. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: Evo-DKD是一个双解码器框架，结合结构化本体遍历和非结构化文本推理，用于自主本体演化，优于纯结构化或非结构化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体和知识图谱需要持续演化以保持全面性和准确性，但手动维护成本高。LLMs拥有大量非结构化知识，但难以保持结构化一致性。

Method: Evo-DKD采用双解码器框架，一个生成本体编辑候选，另一个生成自然语言解释，通过动态注意力门控机制协调两者。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-DKD在精确度和下游任务性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD结合符号和神经推理，为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外光谱分析面临高维重叠谱带的挑战，传统方法难以应对，而LLM的泛化和推理能力为自动化复杂科学流程提供了新可能。

Method: 研究设计了一个LLM驱动的框架，整合文献知识库、光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理，通过闭环多轮协议动态优化预测。

Result: 在多种材料数据集上，多轮LLM推理的表现优于单轮推理，并在低数据条件下媲美或超越传统机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为红外光谱分析提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，尤其在低数据条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI行为建模树立新标准，其原型桥接方法可扩展至其他领域。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

Result: 决策时间从几天或几周缩短至几分钟或几小时，显著提高了规划者和高管的效率。

Conclusion: LLMs技术可以显著优化供应链管理决策过程，提升效率并减少对专家的依赖。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得了进展，但其在面对不可回答问题时可能产生有害或不诚实内容，这一问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 定义了四种不可回答的视觉问题类型，构建了包含12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，并对28种MLLMs进行了诚实性评估。

Result: 发现大多数模型无法适当拒绝回答，且诚实行为受视觉信息影响，需开发专门的多模态对齐方法。

Conclusion: 通过监督和偏好学习初步实现了诚实行为对齐，为未来可信MLLMs研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群舞生成需要同步多个舞者并保持空间协调，现有方法难以处理密集的时空交互，导致可扩展性问题和碰撞。

Method: 使用轻量级图卷积进行空间建模，稀疏注意力进行时间建模，降低计算成本。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成长且连贯的群舞序列。

Conclusion: ST-GDance有效解决了群舞生成中的计算复杂性和碰撞问题。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization,
and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless
communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and
adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming
wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core
communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance
versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning

Method: 提出基于动态记忆的个性化解释模型，根据用户历史交互调整解释内容。

Result: 模型能更精准地提供用户可能感兴趣的新信息。

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法能提升AI解释的透明度和用户友好性。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Motivation: 解决音频-视觉多任务增量学习中如何保留旧任务知识并促进新任务学习的挑战。

Method: PHP方法分为三个阶段：浅层阶段使用任务共享模态聚合适配器；中层阶段提出任务特定模态共享动态生成适配器；深层阶段引入任务特定模态独立提示。

Conclusion: PHP方法通过平衡知识共享和任务特异性，有效解决了多任务增量学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Result: 发现贝叶斯推理在现代具身智能发展中未起核心作用，同时指出当前系统局限于封闭物理世界环境。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法有望在推动具身智能向开放物理世界发展方面发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 可读性决策在多智能体团队协作中具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Motivation: 劳动力管理中的任务分配（staffing）和员工画像（profiling）是紧密相关的挑战，现有解决方案缺乏灵活性和自然交互能力。

Conclusion: StaffPro为自动化人员管理提供了灵活、可解释且以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）相比纯语言模型更容易受到有害输入的影响。研究通过分析其内部动态，定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并提出了一种无需微调的技术（SASA）来提升安全性。

Motivation: LVLMs对有害输入的脆弱性高于纯语言模型，研究旨在通过分析其内部动态和提出改进方法来增强安全性。

Method: 定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并提出SASA技术，通过将中间层的语义信息投影到早期安全层来增强安全性。

Result: 实验表明，SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，同时对实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: SASA是一种有效的方法，能够在不微调的情况下提升LVLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，利用图信号处理重新参数化，并通过最小化Bellman误差进行训练。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以更少的迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种简洁、可迁移且统一的策略与值迭代表示，显著降低了推理复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效推断异质性因果关系，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

Motivation: 现有方法如FlowGRPO在图像生成的人偏好对齐中效率不足，需要采样和优化所有去噪步骤。

Method: MixGRPO引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内使用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略和滑动窗口设计，高效解决了现有方法的效率问题，同时保持了性能优势。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

*Kuiye Ding,Fanda Fan,Yao Wang,Ruijie jian,Xiaorui Wang,Luqi Gong,Yishan Jiang,Chunjie Luo an Jianfeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DualSG框架，利用LLM作为语义指导模块而非独立预测器，结合传统预测方法提升多变量时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM作为端到端预测器导致数值精度损失或模态对齐困难，需改进LLM在时间序列预测中的使用方式。

Method: 提出DualSG双流框架，引入时间序列描述（Time Series Caption）作为显式提示，设计基于描述的融合模块。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG优于15种基线方法，验证了显式结合数值预测与语义指导的价值。

Conclusion: DualSG通过LLM的语义指导与传统预测结合，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动目标识别（AGR）方法，结合联合信念更新和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS），在多智能体环境中高效推断隐藏目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，理解其他智能体的信念和意图对有效交互至关重要。现有目标识别方法通常将观察者视为被动推理者，AGR则通过主动收集信息减少不确定性。

Method: 采用概率框架，结合联合信念更新机制和MCTS算法，无需领域特定知识即可高效推断目标。

Result: 在网格域中的实验表明，联合信念更新显著优于被动目标识别，且领域无关的MCTS表现与领域特定的贪婪基线相当。

Conclusion: 该解决方案为多智能体系统的目标推断提供了实用且鲁棒的框架，推动了交互性和适应性的发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出EDGE-GRPO算法，通过熵驱动优势和引导错误校正解决GRPO算法中的优势崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法因稀疏奖励规则导致组内奖励相同，引发优势崩溃问题，现有方法通过模型反思和内部反馈解决，但仍有局限。

Method: 分析模型反思的局限性，研究细粒度样本级别的策略熵，提出EDGE-GRPO算法，结合熵驱动优势和引导错误校正。

Result: 在多个主要推理基准测试中验证了算法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO算法成功解决了GRPO的优势崩溃问题，实验证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过联合编辑多模态数据，有效解决了自动驾驶系统中的长尾分布问题，提升了罕见类别的识别能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Result: 在节点分类和环境规划两个问题上验证了框架的有效性，显著提高了分类准确性并支持复杂决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为图数据提供了一种强大的神经符号方法，结合了学习和推理能力，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Motivation: GitHub仓库的README文件内容不完整可能影响其使用和推广，研究旨在通过自动分类工具提升README文件的质量和实用性。

Method: 研究微调了三种编码器LLMs（BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa），并采用PEFT技术（如LoRA）进行参数高效微调。

Result: 方法在分类任务中表现优异，F1分数达0.98，且PEFT技术在不显著降低性能的情况下节省了资源。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于自动分类GitHub README文件内容，为提升仓库识别和使用潜力提供了自动化工具。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Result: 在六个数据集上的详细案例研究表明，语言建模能有效支持零样本HAR系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为不依赖LLM的零样本HAR提供了可行方案，展示了语言建模的潜力。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Conclusion: 领域适配和推理增强的LLMs在网络运维中具有实际和可解释的RCA潜力。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升AI在公共卫生和生物医学中的透明度和信任度，满足不同利益相关者（如临床医生、政策制定者和公众）对解释的需求。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动了透明、以人为中心的AI在公共卫生领域的应用。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user

TL;DR: UI-AGILE框架通过改进训练和推理阶段，解决了GUI代理在推理设计、奖励无效和视觉噪声方面的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在训练和推理中存在推理设计困境、奖励无效和视觉噪声问题，亟需改进。

Method: 1) 训练阶段：提出连续奖励函数、"简单思考"奖励和裁剪重采样策略；2) 推理阶段：引入分解定位与选择方法。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，ScreenSpot-Pro上定位准确率提升23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE框架通过综合优化训练和推理，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和准确性。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: UserBench是一个用户中心基准，用于评估LLM代理在多轮、偏好驱动的交互中的表现，发现现有模型在用户意图对齐和偏好识别上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达目标时与用户主动协作的能力不足，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入UserBench，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具决策。

Result: 评估显示，模型仅20%的时间完全对齐用户意图，高级模型主动识别的偏好不足30%。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了关键评估环境，凸显了任务执行与用户对齐的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在学习和识别参数化PDEs时效率低、参数多且缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 通过将前向欧拉离散化嵌入卷积架构，利用CFL兼容的系数参数化确保稳定性和一阶收敛性。

Result: 在多种PDEs测试中，DeepFDM的误差比现有方法低1-2个数量级，训练更快且参数更少。

Conclusion: DeepFDM为数据驱动的PDE求解和参数识别提供了高效、透明且稳健的基准。

Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning
spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a
convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order
convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights
correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable
inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar
PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and
inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger
distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared
errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators,
U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer
parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match
ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust,
efficient, and transparent baseline for data-driven solution and identification
of parametric PDEs.

Result: 数值验证表明方案满足能量守恒、局部非负熵产生，并在刚性松弛极限下与傅里叶定律一致。

Conclusion: 该方案在Voronoi网格上实现了热力学兼容的数值模拟，适用于可压缩热传导流动问题。

Abstract: We propose a new curl-free and thermodynamically compatible finite volume
scheme on Voronoi grids to solve compressible heat conducting flows written in
first-order hyperbolic form. The approach is based on the definition of
compatible discrete curl-grad operators, exploiting the triangular nature of
the dual mesh. We design a cell solver reminiscent of the nodal solvers used in
Lagrangian schemes to discretize the evolution equation for the thermal impulse
vector, and we demonstrate that the resulting numerical scheme ensures energy
conservation, local non-negative entropy production, as well as asymptotic
consistency with the classical Fourier law in the stiff relaxation limit. A
novel technique is proposed to transfer residuals from the dual to the primal
mesh as subfluxes, which eventually yields the construction of entropy
compatible semi-discrete methods. The scheme and its properties are validated
on a set of numerical test cases.

Result: 证明了算法的有界性和误差估计，数值实验验证了理论结果和算法的准确性及效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂活性流体模拟中表现出高效性和准确性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with mixed finite element method (FEM) for solving
the two-dimensional, nonlinear fourth-order active fluid equations. By
introducing an auxiliary variable $w=-\Delta u$, the original fourth problem is
transformed into a system of second-order equations, which relaxes the
regularity requirements of standard $H^2$-conforming finite spaces. To further
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, an additional auxiliary
variable $\phi$, treated analogously to the pressure, is introduced, leading to
a divergence-free preserving mixed finite element scheme. A fully discrete
scheme is then constructed by coupling the spatial mixed FEM with the
variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The
boundedness of the scheme and corresponding error estimates can be rigorously
proven under appropriate assumptions due to unconditional non-linear stability
and second-order accuracy of the DLN method. To enhance computational
efficiency in practice, we develop an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on
a minimum-dissipation criterion. Several numerical experiments are displayed to
fully validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of the scheme for complex active fluid simulations.

Motivation: 高维离散分布函数的压缩在计算和存储上具有挑战性，需要一种高效且准确的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段用现有子程序将分布函数编码为张量链格式；第二阶段用NTT拟合并通过对数障碍项确保非负性，采用二阶交替最小化加速收敛。

Result: 实验表明，NTT拟合方法比之前提出的乘法更新方法收敛更快，并能准确压缩目标分布函数。

Conclusion: 该方法在压缩高维离散分布函数时表现出高效性和准确性。

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient numerical approach for compressing a
high-dimensional discrete distribution function into a non-negative tensor
train (NTT) format. The two settings we consider are variational inference and
density estimation, whereby one has access to either the unnormalized analytic
formula of the distribution or the samples generated from the distribution. In
particular, the compression is done through a two-stage approach. In the first
stage, we use existing subroutines to encode the distribution function in a
tensor train format. In the second stage, we use an NTT ansatz to fit the
obtained tensor train. For the NTT fitting procedure, we use a log barrier term
to ensure the positivity of each tensor component, and then utilize a
second-order alternating minimization scheme to accelerate convergence. In
practice, we observe that the proposed NTT fitting procedure exhibits
drastically faster convergence than an alternative multiplicative update method
that has been previously proposed. Through challenging numerical experiments,
we show that our approach can accurately compress target distribution
functions.

Conclusion: 松弛能量泛函和自适应策略为Bose-Einstein凝聚的数值模拟提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates numerical methods for approximating the ground state
of Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs) by introducing two relaxed formulations of
the Gross--Pitaevskii energy functional. These formulations achieve first- and
second-order accuracy with respect to the relaxation parameter \( \tau \), and
are shown to converge to the original energy functional as \( \tau \to 0 \). A
key feature of the relaxed functionals is their concavity, which ensures that
local minima lie on the boundary of the concave hull. This property prevents
energy increases during constraint normalization and enables the development of
energy-dissipative algorithms. Numerical methods based on sequential linear
programming are proposed, accompanied by rigorous analysis of their stability
with respect to the relaxed energy. To enhance computational efficiency, an
adaptive strategy is introduced, dynamically refining solutions obtained with
larger relaxation parameters to achieve higher accuracy with smaller ones.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the stability, convergence, and energy
dissipation of the proposed methods, while showcasing the adaptive strategy's
effectiveness in improving computational performance.

Abstract: We present a fully analytic approach for evaluating boundary integrals in two
dimensions for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Conventional methods
often rely on boundary particles or wall re-normalization approaches derived
from applying the divergence theorem, whereas our method directly evaluates the
area integrals for SPH kernels and gradients over triangular boundaries. This
direct integration strategy inherently accommodates higher-order boundary
conditions, such as piecewise cubic fields defined via Finite Element stencils,
enabling analytic and flexible coupling with mesh-based solvers. At the core of
our approach is a general solution for compact polynomials of arbitrary degree
over triangles by decomposing the boundary elements into elementary integrals
that can be solved with closed-form solutions. We provide a complete,
closed-form solution for these generalized integrals, derived by relating the
angular components to Chebyshev polynomials and solving the resulting radial
integral via a numerically stable evaluation of the Gaussian hypergeometric
function $_2F_1$. Our solution is robust and adaptable and works regardless of
triangle geometries and kernel functions. We validate the accuracy against
high-precision numerical quadrature rules, as well as in problems with known
exact solutions. We provide an open-source implementation of our general
solution using differentiable programming to facilitate the adoption of our
approach to SPH and other contexts that require analytic integration over
polygonal domains. Our analytic solution outperforms existing numerical
quadrature rules for this problem by up to five orders of magnitude, for
integrals and their gradients, while providing a flexible framework to couple
arbitrary triangular meshes analytically to Lagrangian schemes, building a
strong foundation for addressing several grand challenges in SPH and beyond.

Conclusion: 该方法在解快速变化的空间问题上优于多项式谱方法和有限元方法，具有高效和精确的优势。

Abstract: Spectral methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) often use Fourier or
polynomial spectral expansions on either uniform and non-uniform grids.
However, while very widely used, especially for slowly-varying solutions,
non-uniform spatial grids can give larger spatial discretization errors if the
solutions change rapidly in space. Here, we implement a Fourier method that
employs fast trigonometric expansions on a uniform grid with non-periodic
boundaries using fast discrete sine transforms (DST) or/and discrete cosine
transforms (DCT) to solve parabolic PDEs. We implement this method in two ways:
either using a Fourier spectral derivative or a Fourier interaction picture
approach. These methods can treat vector fields with a combination of Dirichlet
and/or Neumann boundary conditions in one or more space dimensions. We use them
to solve a variety of PDEs with analytical solutions, including the Peregrine
solitary wave solution. For the 1D heat equation problem, our method with an
interaction picture is accurate up to the machine precision. A soluble example
of an SPDE with non-periodic boundaries is also treated. We compare the results
obtained from these algorithms with those from publicly available solvers that
use either polynomial spectral or finite element methods. For problems with
solutions that vary rapidly in space, our method outperforms the other methods
by recording lower spatial discretization errors, as well being faster in many
cases, due to the efficiency improvements given by fast transforms.

Conclusion: 提出的FMM方法在计算半平面Laplace方程时高效且精确，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast multipole method (FMM) for solving the
two-dimensional Laplace equation in a half-plane with Robin boundary
conditions. The method is based on a novel expansion theory for the reaction
component of the Green's function. By applying the Fourier transform, the
reaction field component is obtained in a Sommerfeld-type integral form. We
derive far-field approximations and corresponding shifting and translation
operators from the Fourier integral representation. The FMM for the reaction
component is then developed by using the new far-field approximations
incorporated into the classic FMM framework in which the tree structure is
constructed from the original and image charges. Combining this with the
standard FMM for the free-space components, we develop a fast algorithm to
compute the interaction of the half plane Laplace Green's function. We prove
that the method exhibits exponential convergence, similar to the free-space
FMM. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical
results and demonstrate that the FMM achieves $O(N)$ computational complexity.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在持续学习中存在灾难性遗忘问题，即学习新任务后旧任务性能下降。论文旨在通过模仿人类学习策略（如主动回忆、刻意练习和间隔重复）来解决这一问题。

Method: TFC-SR方法在标准经验回放中引入了主动回忆探针（Active Recall Probe），定期评估模型记忆以稳定过去知识的表示。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100上，TFC-SR的最终准确率为13.17%，显著优于标准回放方法的7.40%。实验表明其优势来自探针的稳定作用而非回放量的差异。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种高效且鲁棒的持续学习方法，强调了在持续学习系统中集成主动记忆检索机制的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned
Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global
properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in
local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world
examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our
understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖核函数捕捉数据非线性，但需专家确保非线性最大化数据多样性和变异性。

Method: 提出三种独立性准则，设计无监督和监督降维方法，并在不同设置下评估对比度、准确性和可解释性。

Result: 方法在性能上优于基线方法（如tSNE、PCA等），并为可解释机器学习开辟了新方向。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释机器学习提供了新思路，方法在性能和可解释性上表现优异。

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for
the researchers.

Method: 提出了一种基于形态学的课程对比学习方法，通过增强潜在表示来改进动态特征提取，并减少计算成本。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够在保持性能的同时使用更小的补丁尺寸。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能有效解决野火预测中的数据不平衡和计算成本问题，为风险管理提供新思路。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在较少迭代和较低计算复杂度下实现更优的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代大规模MIMO系统提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector
that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The
method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables
efficient, interpretable, and low-complexity MIMO signal detection. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on real-valued approximations, our method operates
natively in the complex domain, aligning with the fundamental nature of signal
processing tasks. The proposed algorithm requires only a small number of
trainable parameters, allowing for simplified training. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection performance
with fewer iterations and lower computational complexity, making it a practical
solution for next-generation massive MIMO systems.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,

Conclusion: 需要开发能同时处理多种分布偏移的模型，并进一步研究OOD数据的影响。

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督异常检测和医学影像应用中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve

from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities
unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法（如DPO）将偏好学习视为最大似然估计问题，忽略了先验奖励知识，可能导致对齐效果不佳。

Method: MaPPO扩展了最大似然估计范式，引入最大后验目标，整合先验奖励估计，支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MaPPO显著提升了对齐性能，且计算效率未受影响。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化框架，优于现有方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

Motivation: 临床LLMs在输入微小变化（如症状掩盖或否定）时表现不佳，而标准NLP指标无法检测这种潜在表示变化。

Method: 通过结构化对抗编辑（掩盖、否定、同义词替换和数值变化）生成临床笔记，并在PCA降维的潜在空间中计算LDFR。

Result: 发现临床LLMs在表面变化极小的情况下仍表现出潜在脆弱性，并在真实临床数据中验证了LDFR的普适性。

Conclusion: 几何感知评估对安全关键的临床AI至关重要，揭示了表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性之间的差距。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

Conclusion: 该框架为图学习提供了一种原则性、可解释且资源高效的替代方案，优于传统深度神经网络架构。

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far

Result: 方法在异质图中捕捉长距离依赖有效，但在节点分类任务中表现不一致。

Conclusion: 结构学习能改善浅层GCN在异质图中的性能，但通用性受限。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of
digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in
contested environments.

TL;DR: AdaptHetero是一个基于机器学习解释的框架，旨在通过解释性洞察指导针对不同子群体的模型训练和评估，以提升EHR数据的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据的复杂性和异质性限制了机器学习解释在指导子群体特定建模中的有效性。

Method: 结合SHAP解释和无监督聚类，识别临床有意义的子群体特征。

Result: 在三个大规模EHR数据集上验证，AdaptHetero能一致识别模型行为的异质性，并提升预测性能。

Conclusion: AdaptHetero通过解释性洞察为子群体特定建模提供了可操作的指导，显著改善了预测效果。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对语言模型的梯度反转攻击方法Grab，通过混合优化显著提高了私有训练数据的恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管梯度反转攻击在视觉模型中已被证明是隐私威胁，但在语言模型中因离散性而被低估。本文旨在揭示其在语言模型中的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出Grab方法，结合交替优化过程：层间dropout掩码优化和离散优化，以解决实际训练中的挑战。

Result: Grab在基准和实际设置中分别实现了最高92.9%和48.5%的恢复率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Grab为理解语言模型在联邦学习中的隐私威胁提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单一组合式LLM的交互式多模态应用（IMA）新范式，解决了多任务适应和资源效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多个LLM处理不同IMA任务，效率低且资源消耗大。本文旨在通过单一LLM实现多任务适应，并优化资源使用。

Method: 提出ContextLoRA方法，通过任务依赖图学习IMA间的结构化上下文，并开发ContextGear调度策略优化训练过程。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优越，并在真实无线测试平台上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 单一组合式LLM能高效适应多任务IMA，ContextLoRA和ContextGear显著提升了性能和资源效率。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分布不均衡且长尾，传统算法在非均衡数据上表现不佳，需开发能直接从现实数据中学习的鲁棒算法。

Method: 论文分为四部分：1）从长尾数据学习生成模型；2）通过归纳正则化提升尾部类别泛化能力；3）半监督学习优化相关指标；4）高效域适应。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效处理现实世界中的不均衡数据，减少对数据标注的依赖，提升模型在多样化数据上的表现。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bubbleformer是一种基于Transformer的时空模型，能够自主预测沸腾动态（如成核、界面演化和传热），无需依赖模拟数据，并在多相沸腾流动中取得了新的基准结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在推理时需要未来输入（如气泡位置），无法从过去状态学习成核现象，且无法建模流动沸腾速度场，因此需要一种能够自主预测沸腾动态的模型。

Method: Bubbleformer采用因子化轴向注意力、频率感知缩放和热物理参数条件化，以泛化到不同流体、几何形状和操作条件。

Result: Bubbleformer在预测和预报两相沸腾流动方面取得了新的基准结果，并通过物理指标评估了热流一致性、界面几何和质量守恒。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer通过创新的模型设计和高质量数据集BubbleML 2.0，显著提升了沸腾动态建模的自主性和准确性。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Method: 提出Adam-PnP框架，结合自适应噪声估计和动态模态加权机制，指导预训练的蛋白质扩散模型。

Result: 在复杂重建任务中显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Adam-PnP为多源数据驱动的蛋白质结构生成提供了高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多项式混沌展开（PCE）在高维问题中因基函数数量指数增长而难以扩展，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合PCE与概率电路思想，提出DeepPCE，一种深度泛化的PCE方法。

Result: DeepPCE在高维输入空间中表现优异，预测性能与多层感知机（MLP）相当，同时保留了PCE的精确统计推断能力。

Conclusion: DeepPCE是PCE的高效扩展，适用于高维问题，兼具预测性能和统计推断优势。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统过于关注点击相关性，忽视了多样性和新颖性，而传统强化学习方法依赖随机探索，可能不符合用户兴趣。

Method: LAAC利用LLM作为参考策略提出新颖项目，并通过轻量级策略优化这些建议，采用双层优化训练演员和评论家网络。

Result: 实验表明，LAAC在多样性、新颖性和准确性上优于现有基线，且在数据不平衡时表现稳健。

Conclusion: LAAC成功整合LLM知识，无需昂贵微调，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

Method: 通过自动编码器找到不变流形，将全阶模型的向量场投影到流形上，并用动态数据修正或作为贝叶斯先验更新。使用神经常微分方程方法。

Result: 在数据充足、稀缺或全阶模型参数错误的情况下，混合方法比纯数据方法显著提升了时间序列预测能力。

Conclusion: 混合方法在多种场景下均优于纯数据方法，展示了结合物理模型与数据驱动技术的优势。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Result: 方法能够从稀疏图像中学习时空变形表示，提高模拟准确性和结果可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合数据驱动学习和物理约束，为弹性物体模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

Method: 提出CDNet，利用卷积近似反向扩散步骤学习样本间转换，并结合不确定性加权复合损失进行鲁棒训练。

Result: 在UCR Archive和模拟数据集上，CDNet显著提升了现有深度学习分类器的性能。

Conclusion: CDNet在挑战性数据条件下有效提升了时间序列分类的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

Motivation: 现有求解器多针对单车辆问题，且在多车辆问题中因短视决策和忽略关键特性（如局部拓扑关系、车辆排列不变性和节点对称性）导致性能不佳。

Method: ECHO采用双模态节点编码器捕捉局部拓扑关系，参数自由交叉注意力机制减少短视决策，并引入数据增强策略稳定强化学习训练。

Result: 实验表明ECHO在车辆和节点数量变化时优于现有方法，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了所有提出方法的有效性，ECHO为MMHCVRP提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

Motivation: 传统神经网络（如RNN、CNN和Transformer）在处理长序列时因内存限制而表现不佳，SSMs虽能解决这一问题，但其训练和推理在传统硬件上计算和内存开销大。

Method: 设计了基于脉动阵列的EpochCore加速器，引入LIMA-PE处理单元和ProDF数据流，以高效支持SSMs和传统DNNs。

Conclusion: EpochCore为SSMs提供了高效的硬件解决方案，显著提升了长序列任务的性能。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

Motivation: 多目标强化学习中，系统探索非凸奖励目标下的Pareto稳态解是一个重要但未充分研究的问题。

Method: 结合加权Chebyshev（WC）和actor-critic框架，提出MOCHA算法，通过选择学习率优化样本复杂度。

Result: MOCHA在样本复杂度上表现出对权重向量最小项的依赖，并在实验中显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: MOCHA算法在多目标强化学习中有效探索Pareto稳态解，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

Result: 发现大量数据泄漏和冗余，基线模型通过利用这些问题超越了现有先进模型。

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA不适合作为基准数据集，需开发更可靠的数据集。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扭矩的层次化图重连策略，通过动态调整消息传递来提升异质图表示学习并增强对噪声图的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络（GNNs）在原生图结构上的消息传递可能不够高效，尤其是在异质图和噪声图中，因此需要开发图重连方法以优化信息传播。

Method: 提出了一种干扰感知的扭矩度量，结合结构距离和能量分数量化边的扰动，通过修剪高扭矩边和添加低扭矩边来层次化重构每层的感受野。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在异质图和同质图上均优于现有方法，并在噪声图上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 扭矩驱动的层次化重连策略有效提升了GNNs在异质图和噪声图上的性能，为图结构优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

TL;DR: MemShare是一种新型KV缓存管理方法，通过识别和重用相似的中间推理步骤，显著减少内存开销并提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中生成冗长的思维链序列，导致内存开销大。观察到中间推理步骤高度相似，对应相似的KV缓存状态，因此提出MemShare。

Method: MemShare采用协同过滤算法高效识别可重用的KV缓存块，并实现零拷贝缓存重用。

Result: 实验结果显示，MemShare在保持准确性的同时，吞吐量提升高达84.79%。

Conclusion: MemShare通过优化KV缓存管理，有效减少内存开销并提升性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新框架PVD-Net和PVD-ONet，用于解决奇异摄动问题，无需数据仅依赖控制方程，并在稳定性和高精度建模方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理信息神经网络（如PINN和DeepONet）在奇异摄动问题上难以收敛，因此需要新的方法。

Method: PVD-Net采用两网络架构（稳定性优先）或五网络架构（高精度优先），结合Prandtl或Van Dyke匹配条件；PVD-ONet通过多模块DeepONet扩展为算子学习框架。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在多种误差指标下均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PVD-Net和PVD-ONet为多尺度问题提供了高效的新解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

TL;DR: RAGDP是一种无需额外训练的新框架，通过知识库加速预训练扩散策略的推理，提高准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略（DPs）生成动作耗时，而现有知识蒸馏方法（如CP）训练时间长。RAGDP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RAGDP通过编码专家演示构建向量数据库，推理时提取相似动作并结合噪声去除步骤以减少生成步骤。

Result: RAGDP在20倍加速下仍保持准确性优势，比CP模型准确率提高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP在无需额外训练的情况下，显著改善了扩散策略的准确性和速度权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

Motivation: 有限的内存和计算资源限制了代理的能力，但目前对如何最优分配这些资源的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究了一个简单的持续学习问题——容量受限的LQG序列预测问题，并在适当技术条件下推导出解决方案。

Result: 提出了LQG问题的解决方案，并展示了在稳态下如何最优分配子问题容量。

Conclusion: 本文为系统研究有限容量下的学习问题迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

TL;DR: Latte框架通过本地和外部记忆库在分布式学习中实现测试时适应，提升模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决分布式学习中测试数据有限和个性化需求的问题。

Method: 每个客户端维护本地记忆库和外部记忆库，通过服务器协调获取相似客户端的原型。

Result: 在领域适应和损坏基准测试中表现优异，通信和计算成本低。

Conclusion: Latte在分布式学习中有效且高效。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet
evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey
provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation,
introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1)
evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior,
capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric
computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of
agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

Result: 模型在合成数据和神经记录上验证，能准确恢复流形结构，且计算成本随数据长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该模型在效率和可解释性上优于现有方法，适用于复杂时间序列建模。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

Conclusion: 简单输出结构在广泛数据范围内具有竞争力。

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Conclusion: 双曲框架为基因组表示学习提供了稳健的新范式，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

Result: 实验显示DGP在可控标记预算内，性能提升6.8%（AUPRC）。

Conclusion: DGP展示了图增强LLM在欺诈检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

Conclusion: PREIG通过结合领域知识、优化理论和深度学习，为高维非线性时间序列预测提供了稳健、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Conclusion: ZS-PAG在零样本遗忘场景中有效解决了过遗忘问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

Abstract: Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists use advanced
microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure, while theorists and
computational scientists develop models that link processing, structure, and
properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design
where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal
microstructures and manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging
with predictive simulations and data-driven optimization accelerates discovery
and deepens understanding of process-structure-property relationships. The
differentiable physics framework evoxels is based on a fully Pythonic, unified
voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical
simulations, inverse modeling, and machine learning.

TL;DR: TempRe是一种生成框架，将基于模板的方法重新定义为序列生成，解决了传统方法的可扩展性和泛化问题，并在单步和多步逆合成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆合成规划在分子发现中是一个核心挑战，传统基于模板的方法可扩展性差且泛化能力有限，而无需模板的生成方法可能产生无效反应。

Method: 提出TempRe框架，将基于模板的方法重新定义为序列生成，实现可扩展、灵活且化学合理的逆合成。

Result: 在单步和多步逆合成任务中，TempRe优于模板分类和基于SMILES的生成方法，并在PaRoutes多步基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: TempRe展示了模板生成模型在计算机辅助合成规划中的潜力，为多步合成路线生成提供了轻量高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度无线感知（DWS）模型多为黑盒，缺乏可解释性，影响其通用性和安全性。

Method: 通过非平凡理论推导，将实值白盒Transformer扩展至复数域，并引入子空间正则化策略提升特征多样性。

Result: RF-CRATE在多个RF感知任务中表现优异，平均性能提升19.98%，分类增益5.08%，回归误差降低10.34%。

Conclusion: RF-CRATE在保持高性能的同时实现了数学可解释性，为RF感知领域提供了新工具。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS技术对可持续发展至关重要，但优化其决策变量面临挑战，尤其是在高斯过程（GPs）表现不佳的情况下。研究旨在探索更有效的随机模型以提升BO在CCS项目中的应用。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化框架，比较了高斯过程和其他新型随机模型在CCS项目优化中的表现，重点关注多目标函数和大量决策变量的场景。

Result: 研究表明，在复杂环境下，某些新型随机模型优于高斯过程，能够提升经济可行性（如净现值NPV）并促进CCS技术的可持续部署。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将BO应用于油藏工程领域，展示了其在能源行业可持续发展中的潜力，为未来优化CCS项目提供了新方法。

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

Motivation: FNOs在高维偏微分方程中表现优异，但其稳定性、泛化性和频率行为缺乏理论解释。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用无限维函数空间的有效场论分析，推导层核和四点顶点的闭合递推关系，并研究三种实际场景：解析激活、尺度不变情况和残差连接架构。

Result: 理论表明非线性激活会耦合频率输入到高频模式，实验验证了频率转移现象；同时提出了权重初始化的临界条件。

Conclusion: 非线性使FNOs能捕捉非平凡特征，临界性分析为超参数选择提供依据，尺度不变激活和残差连接能增强特征学习。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

Result: 方法能高精度发现ODE，对噪声数据鲁棒，且无需正则化即可实现稀疏解。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的物理现象学习提供了实用工具，适用于真实实验环境。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have
performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension,
higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a
protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure,

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one

on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level
Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA

propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank
algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework
to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific
features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and
regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters,
learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and
SHAP-based interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了强化学习（RL）在大型语言模型（LLMs）后训练中的应用，通过Meta的广告生成工具AdLlama展示了RLPF方法的有效性，显著提升了广告点击率和广告主满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习在LLMs后训练中的经济影响，填补这一领域的量化研究空白。

Method: 提出RLPF方法，利用历史广告表现数据作为奖励信号进行后训练，并通过大规模A/B测试验证效果。

Result: AdLlama在10周测试中提升点击率6.7%，广告主生成更多广告变体，满意度提高。

Conclusion: RLPF是一种有前景的后训练方法，能够将语言模型能力转化为实际成果。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅是模型压缩技术，还能显著提升黑盒对抗攻击的效率和效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Conclusion: DRL在库存管理中实现了数据驱动学习与分析洞察的结合，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

Conclusion: 正交多项式基（如Legendre）在模型表达性和训练效率之间提供了更优的权衡。

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于复杂预测环境中的泛化提升。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.
