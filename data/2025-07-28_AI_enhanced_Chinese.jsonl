However, their application\nto CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical\nsimulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of\nresolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in\nsmall-scale turbulent structures, error propagation becomes a major issue,\nmaking long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace\nmethods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process\nturbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a\nvery large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this\nwork, a ROM framework using Koopman $\\beta$-variational autoencoders\n($\\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale\nturbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear\ndynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By\nconstraining the latent space of a $\\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman\nloss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in\nreconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an\nunsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time.\nCombined with an LSTM ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables,\nthe model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles,\nshowing that the Koopman $\\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables\nand remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally\nover multiple cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman \u03b2-VAE\u7684\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u964d\u9636\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6e4d\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u5b9a\u5e38\u6d41\u52a8\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u03b2-VAE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5f15\u5165Koopman\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LSTM\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Windsor\u4f53LES\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u566a\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Koopman \u03b2-VAE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6e4d\u6d41\u964d\u9636\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002"}}

The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends\nfeatures of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in\nmulti-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media\ncharacterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow\nbehavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and\nby Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from\nthe incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the\nStokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The\nprimary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified\nnumerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow\nregimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to\nresolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework. The\nmethod supports general finite element partitions consisting of convex and\nnon-convex polytopal elements, and employs bubble functions as a critical\nanalytical component to achieve stability and convergence. Optimal-order error\nestimates are rigorously derived for the WG finite element solutions.\nAdditionally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted to validate the\ntheoretical findings, illustrating the method's robustness, reliability,\nflexibility, and accuracy in solving the Brinkman equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f31Galerkin\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3Brinkman\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Stokes\u548cDarcy\u6d41\u7684\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5143\u7d20\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Brinkman\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728Stokes\u548cDarcy\u6d41\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f31Galerkin\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6ce1\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u5143\u7d20\u5212\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Brinkman\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

(2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC\n\"System 2\" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,\nstoring variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By\nexplicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed\nschematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations\nthrough explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on\nfrozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates\nsystematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%\naccuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer\nmodule.

In soft microfluidic channels, internal pressure\ngradients generated by diffusioosmotic flow to conserve mass result in elastic\ndeformation of the channel walls, triggering fluid-structure interaction. In\nthis work, we analyze the fluid-structure interaction between diffusioosmotic\nflow of an electrolyte solution and a deformable microfluidic channel. We\nprovide insight into the physical behavior of the system by developing a\nreduced-order model, in which a viscous film is confined between a rigid bottom\nsurface and an elastic top substrate, represented as a rigid plate connected to\na linear spring. Considering a slender configuration and applying the\nlubrication approximation, we derive a set of two-way coupled governing\nequations describing the evolution of the fluidic film thickness and the solute\nconcentration. Our theoretical predictions show that above a certain\nconcentration gradient threshold, negative pressures induced by diffusioosmotic\nflow give rise to fluid-structure instability, causing the elastic top\nsubstrate to collapse onto the bottom surface.

This research presents the first successful instance of learning under\npartial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves\nperformance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,\ndespite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,\nthe policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in\nbody part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that\nprocesses a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel.

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing\nliquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,\ncompetition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new\nmethodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive\nmarket making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic\ntrading in complex financial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u76c8\u5229\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u6743\u7b97\u6cd5POW-dTS\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5e93\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u505a\u5e02\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u7406\u5e93\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faPOW-dTS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In the experiment, we\nfurther find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for\nassessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the\namount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we\ndevise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of\nun-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of\nun-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms.

Critical to ML-ADAS is the\ncollision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and\nestimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs\nlike YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,\ndetection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features\nextracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the\nmodel trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,\nand reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5916\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u6216\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08\u5982Burgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001Navier-Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1134%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs.

At\nthe same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer\ncompute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.\nThis paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal\ncan be obtained \"for free\" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that\nhas already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive\nset of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we\ndemonstrate that the \"Squisher\" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an\napproximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher\ndiagonal while outperforming baseline methods.

Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating\nclass-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce\nattention to class-defining features.

However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical\nimages remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse\nfinite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep\nlearning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape\ndirectly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating\nbiophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with\nphysiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and\nfiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts\na graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to\nenable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial\nself-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training\ndatasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV\ngeometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter\naccuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing\ninference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and\nsignificantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the\ncycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as\nfew as 200 training samples.

Conventional\ndesign flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are\nlimited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this\npaper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the\nautomatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically\nmultipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two\nstages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised\nfinetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area\nfrom abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

Videos and images\ngenerated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more\ndifficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new\nmodels to detect artificially-generated media.

Using a dataset consisting of\nboth deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an\napproach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on\nidentifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image\nprocessing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction\ntechnique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial\nlandmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance\nmetrics indicating its potential for real-world applications.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired.

First, it is interpretable for\nlife detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as\nbuilding blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.\nSecond, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be\nphysically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from\nother approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular\ncomplexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass\nspectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address\nthis, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly\nwith high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.\nSimulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double\nmodel error, emphasizing the need for standardization.

However, directly training with synthetic datasets\ncompared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To\ntackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely\nSyn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD).

In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition.

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas.

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a\nRectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted\nrectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving\nintricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we\nfurther incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts\nbased on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and\nadaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently\nunify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point\ncloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete\npoint cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

First, our Adaptive\nSemantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused\nsemantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local\ncontext to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and\nPhase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce\nglobal structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,\nour work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal\nmodeling.

While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key\nlimitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to\nbalance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and\nthe time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling\ntrajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a\ndynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain\nand frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory\ninto raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch\npartitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical\nmotion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with\nscale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to\nmodel both fine-grained and long-range dependencies.

The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed\napproach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic\nsystemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents\na fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a\ndynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain\nevent logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential\nTime-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through\nthe Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that\nmeasures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This\ncombined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an\nLP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used\nby existing methods.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool\nfor clinical applications in mammogram synthesis.

However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical\nfindings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep\nlearning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed\nclasses. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image\nPre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the\nlatent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP\nperforms well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals\nthat its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed\ndistribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space.

Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and\nfollow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track\nlesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a\nsharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan\nregistration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence\nprocess. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled\nexperiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the\ntrue lesion center.

Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/", "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

Project Page: https://bjkim95.github.io/haircup/", "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u8138\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u6210\u5206\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8138\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u79bb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u5934\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u8138\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u4ea4\u6362\u8138\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u76843D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
