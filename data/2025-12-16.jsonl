Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

To bypass this, latent-space thinking allows models to think using the continuous embedding space. While existing methods for training those models show domain-specific gains, they fail to maintain performance in complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. We experimentally demonstrate that the Coconut approach, a form of supervised fine-tuning for latent-space thinking, is highly sensitive to design choices and exhibits several inherent limitations. To address these issues, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques -- an underexplored direction in latent-space thinking -- including GRPO and design a novel Latent RL method for directly optimizing the latent thinking steps. Our experimental results reveal that these RL-trained models still lag behind traditional language-space CoT models in the mathematical reasoning domain. We make our codebase publicly available."}

Khmer is a language spoken daily by over 17 million people in Cambodia, receiving little attention in the development of document AI tools.

To address this gap, we present \\textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols. This multi-level approach supports both comprehensive layout analysis and precise information extraction. We benchmark several leading models, providing the first set of baseline results for Khmer business documents, and discuss the distinct challenges posed by non-Latin, low-resource scripts.

Calibration seeks to achieve this by improving the alignment between the model's confidence and the actual likelihood of its responses being correct or desirable. However, it has been observed that the internal confidence of a model, derived from token probabilities, is not well aligned with its verbalized confidence, leading to misleading results with different calibration methods. In this paper, we propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a method using Direct Preference Optimization to align an LLM's verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than ground-truth accuracy, enhancing model transparency and reliability by ensuring closer alignment between the two confidence measures. We evaluate DCA across multiple open-weight LLMs on a wide range of datasets. To further assess this alignment, we also introduce three new calibration error-based metrics. Our results show that DCA improves alignment metrics on certain model architectures, reducing inconsistencies in a model's confidence expression. However, we also show that it can be ineffective on others, highlighting the need for more model-aware approaches in the pursuit of more interpretable and trustworthy LLMs."}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents."}

The surrogate is formulated as a reduced-order model for a canonical configuration in which a one-degree-of-freedom heaving sphere operates near a vertical wall. High-fidelity CFD simulations are used to generate a parametric dataset of heave-decay responses over varying wall distances (WD) and drop heights (DH). Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is then applied to each CFD trajectory to identify a low-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with polynomial terms representing effective hydrostatic restoring and radiation damping, and the harmonic terms representing the wave-induced excitation forces. The SINDy identified coefficients are then used as a prior constraint in a neural operator network (ONet) that learns a smooth mapping from wall distance and drop height to the ODE coefficients, yielding a surrogate capable of predicting dynamics at arbitrary points in the input space without rerunning expensive CFD calculations. The resulting surrogate reproduces CFD heave-decay responses with near-optimal accuracy given the limiting assumptions while being capable of running in real time. The approach provides a practical pathway toward real-time, physics-informed surrogate modelling for launch-and-recovery operations."}

Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs."}

On OpenLane, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 by +6.2 and yields smoother temporal trajectories, showing that small architectural and loss refinements significantly enhance 3D lane robustness without extra sensors or scaling."}

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting."}

The method combines an isoparametric Scott--Vogelius velocity-pressure pair on a cut background mesh with a stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation for imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct finite element spaces that admit robust numerical implementation using standard elementwise polynomial mappings and produce exactly divergence-free discrete velocities. The key components of the analysis are a new inf-sup stability result for the isoparametric Scott--Vogelius pair on unfitted meshes and a combined inf-sup stability result for the bilinear forms associated with the pressure and the Lagrange multiplier. The finite element formulation employs a higher-order Lagrange multiplier space, which ensures stability and mitigates the loss of pressure robustness typically associated with the weak enforcement of boundary conditions for the normal velocity component.\n  The paper provides a complete stability and convergence theory in two dimensions, accounting for the geometric errors introduced by the isoparametric approximation. The analysis demonstrates optimal-order velocity convergence in both the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms and establishes optimal $H^1$-convergence and nearly optimal $L^2$-convergence of a post-processed pressure.

The effect is most commonly attributed to the first normal stress difference $N_{1}$, which induces tensile hoop stresses that draw fluid upward along the rod. The second normal stress difference $N_{2}$, in contrast, is often presumed negligible or dynamically unimportant. However, many polymer solutions and industrial fluids, such as suspensions, exhibit $N_{2}$ of appreciable magnitude, and modern constitutive models predict that it can significantly modify free-surface stresses and thereby the climbing behaviour. In this work, we perform high-resolution axisymmetric simulations of the Linear Phan--Thien--Tanner (LPTT) model to systematically isolate the influence of $N_{2}$ on rod climbing. We show that increasing the magnitude of $N_{2}$ progressively weakens the climbing response and ultimately reverses it, producing rod-descending once the normal-stress ratio exceeds a critical value $ψ_{0}\\approx 0.25$. Larger $N_{2}$ also destabilises the flow, promoting early onset (in terms of the rotation speed) of bubble formation, subcritical Hopf oscillations, and fully asymmetric three-dimensional motion that culminates in rupture. By mapping these regimes in the $(Wi,ψ_{0})$ parameter space, where $Wi$ is the Weissenberg number, we reconcile discrepancies among perturbation theory, experiments, and numerical simulations. These results establish $N_{2}$ as a crucial control parameter governing free-surface stability in viscoelastic liquids."}

This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside advanced prompting techniques and agent-based methods to evaluate the extent to which ConvQA system responses adhere to user utterances. The focus lies on contextual understanding and the ability to provide accurate venue recommendations considering user constraints and situational context. To evaluate utterance-response coherence using an LLM, we synthetically generate user utterances accompanied by correct and modified failure-containing system responses. We use input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency prompting, and multi-agent prompting techniques with 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs of varying sizes and providers, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta. We evaluate our approach on a case study involving restaurant recommendations. The most substantial improvements occur for small non-reasoning models when applying advanced prompting techniques, particularly multi-agent prompting. However, reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning models, with the best performance achieved using single-agent prompting with self-consistency. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 reaches an F1-score of 0.99 at a cost of 0.002 USD per request. Overall, the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency is reached with the non-reasoning model DeepSeek-V3.

To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting.

Using the Boussinesq shallow convection approximation and a specialized expansion of the Laplace equation solutions, we derive a nonlinear equation that can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions. The model rigorously accounts for surface tension, the contribution of the poloidal rolling vortex, and the interplay between buoyancy-driven and thermocapillary flows. We obtain cnoidal waves solutions describing the dynamics of the inner free surface of the Leidenfrost ring, to predict polygonal patterns in liquid nitrogen. These predictions are compared with experimental observations.Additionally, we introduce a simplified model based on poloidal averaging of the capillary pressure, leading to a Korteweg-de Vries-type equation. This simplified model not only reproduces the cnoidal wave solutions but also predicts new trigonometric solutions, offering insights into the formation of peaked polygons."}

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via continuous greedy) for a much richer and more realistic class of problems."}

The method is applied to the modeling of water waves. The dataset used is the DeRisk database, which consists of numerical simulations of water waves. The analysis is restricted to the portion of the wave period between the free-surface zero-upcrossing and the wave crest. The kinematic variables considered are the free-surface slope, the normal component of the fluid velocity at the free surface, and the vertical Lagrangian acceleration of the fluid at the free surface. The stochastic trajectories of these three variables are modeled jointly. The vertical Lagrangian acceleration of the fluid is employed to enforce a wave-breaking filter in the stochastic model.

Our method uses a fixed threshold and existing information from online softmax to identify negligible attention scores, skipping softmax computation, Value block loading, and the subsequent matrix multiplication. This fits seamlessly into existing FlashAttention kernel designs with negligible latency overhead. The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs.

This work presents a comprehensive comparison between SAM3 (Segment Anything Model, also called SAMv3) operating in zero-shot mode and three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, and large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation. The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%. At the appropriate IoU = 0.15 threshold, YOLO models achieve 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1, while SAM3 reaches 59.8% in pure zero-shot mode. However, YOLO exhibits steep degradation 48-50 points across IoU ranges whereas SAM3 drops only 4 points, revealing 12 times superior boundary stability of SAM3. This highlights the strength of SAMv3 in mask precision versus specialization in detection completeness of YOLO11.

The present analysis is performed on a dataset computed by a LES of a supersonic turbine at Ma = 2.0 and Re = 395000. Building on findings related to near-wall streaks and vortices that drive the bubble breathing motion, here, we employ conditional analysis to study extreme bubble events. In events where the recirculation region is small, near-wall high-speed streaks penetrate the bubble and lead to higher tangential Reynolds stresses upstream of the incident shock compared to those with large recirculation. The streaks are accompanied by streamwise vortices that meander and induce intense fluid mixing, leading to higher wall-normal and spanwise Reynolds stresses, and consequently, higher turbulent kinetic energy. This turbulent activity also causes intense fluctuations in wall pressure and skin-friction coefficient along the separation region. In contrast, during events with bubble expansion, high-speed streaks are advected over the separation region, with streamwise vortices appearing only downstream of the shock, resulting in minimal fluid mixing inside the bubble. The analysis of mass flux along the bubble surface reveals that during its contraction phase, mass flux out of the bubble occurs predominantly upstream of the incident shock because of high-speed streaks dragged towards the wall by the streamwise vortices. In the expansion phase, pronounced mass flux into the bubble is observed downstream of the shock, near reattachment. This increased fluid injection is associated with the presence of streamwise vortices and low-momentum flow structures near reattachment, suggesting that fluid entrainment by vortices plays a key role in the mass flux into the bubble."}

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

To address model discrepancies not captured by the reduced-order space, and learn the structure of model deviation, we incorporate a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) constrained to be an orthogonal complement of the best-knowledge manifold. This ensures that the learned correction targets only the unknown components of model bias, preserving the interpretability and fidelity of the physical model. An optimal sensor placement strategy is also investigated to maximize information gained from measurements.

By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics. These analyses suggest that robustness is heavily influenced by two key principles: the richness of conditioning information, which constrains the learning problem, and the absolute information content of the training data, which allows the signal from correct information to dominate statistical noise."}

Various numerical schemes are discussed for the implementation of external body forces, leading to different artefact terms. An order-of-magnitude analysis is provided to demonstrate that the artefact terms are negligible in calculating the shear stress and strain rate tensors, which keeps the study of fluid-wall interaction and the implementation of large eddy simulation (LES) simple. This clarifies the confusion in the literature, where both considering and not considering the artefact terms have been adopted without discussion. Additionally, the fluid-wall interaction force can be computed as the intuitive momentum exchange rate using a special distribution function after a half-step propagation, and consistency is obtained with the formula derived using the Chapman-Enskog analysis. The momentum flux tensor for moving boundaries is uncovered as the cause of violating Galilean invariance and the Maxwell stress tensor for Lorentz force is also contained in this intuitively calculated interaction force for MHD flows due to the modification of equilibrium distribution function.

Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference.

During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\\times$ and maintaining accuracy. Our system demonstrates that intelligent memory disaggregation combined with speculative execution can effectively address the memory wall challenge in large-scale LLM serving.

The method is based on a three-field mixed formulation involving the primal variable, its gradient, and the corresponding Riesz potential, yielding a flux-based structure well suited for LDG discretizations while retaining the intrinsic nonlocal interaction. A key ingredient of our analysis is a rigorous study of the weighted Hölder and Sobolev regularity of the Riesz potential, which enables accurate characterization of boundary singularities. Guided by these regularity results, we propose LDG schemes on quasi-uniform and graded meshes, with additional stabilization in the graded case to reconcile the discrepancy between the discrete spaces for the Riesz potential and flux fields. Optimal a priori error estimates are established, and numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results."}

The methodology integrates three components: a fast body-conforming mesh-generation strategy, a matrix-free finite-element solution of the Laplace equation, and a systematic procedure for determining the stream-function values associated with each immersed solid.\n  Body-fitted grids are generated by imposing boundary displacements on a Cartesian background mesh followed by Laplacian smoothing, yielding simple, robust, and accurate meshes for domains containing multiple immersed bodies. The potential-flow field is obtained by solving the Laplace equation using a matrix-free Conjugate Gradient method, wherein element-level operators are evaluated without assembling global stiffness matrices. Immersed bodies are treated as constant-\\,$ψ$ streamlines, and their unknown stream-function values are determined through multi-point constraints that naturally capture inter-body flow connectivity.\n  The results highlight the ability of the proposed approach to resolve subtle multi-body interaction phenomena with minimal case-setup effort and very low memory requirements, while providing a quantitative measure of potential-flow interference in complex immersed-body systems."}

From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Matérn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed measure."}

This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace. Taken together, these results support a behavioral illusion view of DPO: it teaches models how to act aligned, not what to believe."}

As the total wavefield is non-quasi-periodic, effective truncation techniques are pursued for high-accuracy numerical solvers. We adopt the Green's function for the background periodic structure to construct a boundary integral equation (BIE) on an artificial curve enclosing the perturbation. It serves as a transparent boundary condition (TBC) to truncate the unbounded domain. We develop efficient algorithms to compute such background Green's functions based on the Floquet-Bloch transform and its inverse. Spectrally accurate quadrature rules are developed to discretize the BIE-based TBC. Effective algorithms based on leap and pullback procedures are further developed to compute the total wavefield everywhere in the structure. A number of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new solver. They exhibit that our method for the non-quasi-periodic problem has a time complexity that is even comparable to that of a single quasi-periodic problem."}

This regime is extremely hazardous to rocket nozzles, as it leads to very high off-axis loads. The database under investigation has been obtained both experimentally and numerically by means of a hybrid RANS/LES simulation of the flow issuing from a sub-scale Truncated Ideal Contour (TIC) nozzle, fed with cold air and operating at a Reynolds number on the order of 10^6. The experimental campaign was conducted in the S150 supersonic wind tunnel at the Institut PPRIME in Poitiers.\n  The degree of over-expansion is quantified by the nozzle pressure ratio (NPR). Pressure fluctuations are extracted from several probes positioned along the nozzle wall, considering different NPR values. The intermittent behavior is investigated using conditional statistics based on the wavelet transform, which demonstrates that the aerodynamic loads of the over-expanded jet consist of intermittent bursts rather than continuous variations. The wavelet analysis reveals scale-by-scale intermittency and, in particular, shows that the wall-pressure signals exhibit a significant degree of intermittency around the frequency associated with aerodynamic side-loads. The statistics of these intermittent events, in terms of the time delay between occurrences and in terms of their amplitude, are found to be weakly sensitive to NPRs and to locations along the nozzle wall and appear to follow a universal behaviour that can be modelled by a log-normal distribution. This finding may support the development of a stochastic model of the aerodynamic side-loads."}

Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing. To probe universality beyond genealogy, we train an adversarial scrubber that suppresses language identity while preserving size signal (also at family granularity). Language prediction averaged across languages and settings falls below chance while size prediction remains significantly above chance, indicating cross-family sound-symbolic bias.

However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design."}

A Unified Benchmark for Typographic-Attack Robustness and Text Recognition in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading text within an image overrides visual understanding. Existing evaluation protocols and defenses, largely focused on object recognition, implicitly encourage ignoring text to achieve robustness; however, real-world scenarios often require joint reasoning over both objects and text (e.g., recognizing pedestrians while reading traffic signs). To address this, we introduce a novel task, Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA), which formalizes selective text use in visual question answering (VQA): models must decide, from context, when to read text and when to ignore it. For evaluation, we present the Read-or-Ignore Benchmark (RIO-Bench), a standardized dataset and protocol that, for each real image, provides same-scene counterfactuals (read / ignore) by varying only the textual content and question type. Using RIO-Bench, we show that strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability, highlighting the need for improved approaches. Finally, RIO-Bench enables a novel data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use, moving beyond prior non-adaptive, text-ignoring defenses. Overall, this work reveals a fundamental misalignment between the existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs. Our Project Page is at https://turingmotors.github.io/rio-vqa/."}

While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees.

A dimensionless analysis shows that, within the long-wave lubrication approximation, inclination induces a leading-order coupling of the Bond, Peclet and Damkohler numbers. This coupling defines a characteristic trajectory in the parameter space (Da, Pe, Bo), determined by the structure of the lubrication flux. Coupling this deterministic framework to a minimal stochastic formulation captures the intermittent wet-dry dynamics characteristic of ultrathin films under environmental forcing.

Here, we show that the same deformable boundary can also act as a phase-dependent kinematic constraint on vertical force generation. Using force measurements, particle image velocimetry and potential-flow simulations, we characterize how a free surface reorganizes vortex shedding for a heaving hydrofoil at moderate Reynolds number (O(10^4)). For moderate to deep submergence, the cycle-averaged lift undergoes a systematic transition from repulsion to suction as the unsteady number increases. The reversal occurs within a narrow band of unsteady numbers, where the phase-shifted surface motion generates vertical advection that alters the pairing of trailing-edge vortices and redirects the wake momentum flux. A force decomposition shows that the reversal arises from a coordinated change in quasi-steady pressure loading and wake-induced force. These results identify the phase of the free-surface response, organized by unsteady number, as a key parameter governing near-surface lift and illustrate how deformable boundaries can reconfigure unsteady loading through vortex-surface phase coupling."}

We evaluate the model with a pool of 20 human listeners across three tasks: (a) audio similarity between reference and generated speech, (b) pronunciation and naturalness and (c) Romanian-English code-switching. The results indicate that our approach maintains voice cloning capabilities and enables, to a certain extent, code-switching within the same utterance; however, residual English accent characteristics remain. We open-source our code and provide example audio samples at https://github.com/racai-ro/Ro-F5TTS."}

Real-world mobility is highly non-stationary: abrupt turns, rapid speed changes, and unpredictable user behavior cause conventional predictors to drift, leading to mistimed or failed handovers. We propose a lightweight meta-continual forecasting framework that integrates a GRU-based predictor, Reptile meta-initialization for fast few-shot adaptation, and an EWMA residual detector that triggers compact online updates only when drift occurs. Evaluated on a reproducible GeoLife and DeepMIMO pipeline, our method achieves 4.46 m ADE and 7.79 m FDE in zero-shot settings, improves few-shot ADE to 3.71 m at 10-shot, and enables recovery from abrupt drift about 2 to 3 times faster than an offline GRU. When applied to downstream HO prediction, the approach improves F1 to 0.83 and AUROC to 0.90, with substantial reductions in missed-HO and ping-pong events. The model is lightweight (128k parameters) and suitable for edge deployment in 5G and 6G systems."}

This has left a gap in our understanding of well-being as it is expressed in everyday life. We hypothesized that candid smiles captured during natural smartphone interactions could serve as a scalable, objective behavioral correlate of positive affect. To test this, we analyzed 405,448 video clips passively recorded from 233 consented participants over one week. Using a deep learning model to quantify smile intensity, we identified distinct diurnal and daily patterns. Daily patterns of smile intensity across the week showed strong correlation with national survey data on happiness (r=0.92), and diurnal rhythms documented close correspondence with established results from the day reconstruction method (r=0.80). Higher daily mean smile intensity was significantly associated with more physical activity (Beta coefficient = 0.043, 95% CI [0.001, 0.085]) and greater light exposure (Beta coefficient = 0.038, [0.013, 0.063]), whereas no significant effects were found for smartphone use.

Diffusion models have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, but their applications in 3D turbulence are relatively limited. To achieve reliable autoregressive predictions of 3D turbulence, we propose the DiAFNO model which integrates the implicit adaptive Fourier neural operator (IAFNO) with diffusion model. IAFNO can effectively capture the global frequency and structural features, which is crucial for global consistent reconstructions of the denoising process in diffusion models. Furthermore, based on conditional generation from diffusion models, we design an autoregressive framework in DiAFNO to achieve long-term stable predictions of 3D turbulence. The proposed DiAFNO model is systematically tested with fixed hyperparameters in several types of 3D turbulence, including forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) at Taylor Reynolds number $Re_λ\\approx100$, decaying HIT at initial Taylor Reynolds number at $Re_λ\\approx100$ and turbulent channel flow at friction Reynolds numbers $Re_τ\\approx395$ and $Re_τ\\approx590$.

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation."}

We compare these numerical results to the estimates given by the quasihyperbolic length and perimeter of the compact set. In particular, we consider the behaviour of these value pairs, numerical results and estimates, when the structure parameters vary and the walls of the maze approach the compact set. Over the configurations covered in the numerical experiments, the quasihyperbolic estimates are shown to have the desired asymptotic properties and superior computational efficiencies once the case-specific analysis is completed."}

Here we investigate the competing effect of the attractive ``Cheerios effect'' and the repulsive solutal Marangoni flow by observing the behaviors of two identical oil drops floating on partially miscible pool made of ethanol-water mixtures. Three typical behaviors are found: Repel, Coalesce and Rebound, in which the drops repel each other, attract each other and then coalesce, and attract and rebound upon contact. A scaling theory based on the two competing forces is developed to distinguish the repulsive and attractive behaviors of the drops. For the transition from Coalesce to Rebound, a lubrication layer is found to form when the immersed lower halves of the drops are more than half a sphere, which prevents the drops from coalescing."}

In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words. Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored. Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies. We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses. We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load. Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian. Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations. Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability. Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings. Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable. We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties. Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli."}

However, due to the sparsity of labels under semi-supervised learning, they have been found to exhibit biased performance on specific nodes. This kind of bias has been validated to correlate with topological structure and is considered as a bottleneck of GNNs' performance. Existing work focuses on the study of homogeneous GNNs and little attention has been given to topological bias in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). In this work, firstly, in order to distinguish distinct meta relations, we apply meta-weighting to the adjacency matrix of a heterogeneous graph. Based on the modified adjacency matrix, we leverage PageRank along with the node label information to construct a projection. The constructed projection effectively maps nodes to values that strongly correlated with model performance when using datasets both with and without intra-type connections, which demonstrates the universal existence of topological bias in HGNNs. To handle this bias, we propose a debiasing structure based on the difference in the mapped values of nodes and use it along with the original graph structure for contrastive learning. Experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving HGNNs' performance and debiasing."}

We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning."}

One of the critical research focus is the selection of prompt demonstrations. Current approaches typically employ retrieval models to select the top-K most semantically similar examples as demonstrations. However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels. TopK-SD outperforms original TopK sampling on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides a new perspective for understanding the working mechanisms within ICL."}

However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows."}

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment.

PS has recently been extended to the contextual PS, and some initial experiments have shown the value of the associated HMC model, denoted as HMC-CPS, in image segmentation. Moreover, HMCs have been extended to hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs), which are capable of improving HMC-based Bayesian segmentation. In this study, we introduce a new HEMC-CPS model by simultaneously considering contextual PS and evidential HMC. We show its effectiveness for Bayesian maximum posterior mode (MPM) segmentation using synthetic and real images.

The method couples Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) at the microscale with a GENERIC-compliant Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) at the macroscale, in a concurrent framework, overcoming the limitations of traditional Eulerian-based methods in capturing long-memory and history-dependent effects. At the microscale, DPD serves as a virtual rheometer, employing FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) bead-spring polymer chains. This approach provides key rheological properties, including shear-thinning and zero-shear-rate viscosities, relaxation times, and viscoelastic dynamics, which are quantified via Carreau-Yasuda fitting and spectral analysis. The LHMM couples SPH-derived strain rates with microscopic stress responses using the Irving-Kirkwood formalism. This approach enables a concurrent interaction between macroscopic strain rates and microscopic stress tensors, ensuring a consistent viscoelastic response across scales.The method is validated against benchmark flows, including Reverse Poiseuille Flow and flow through a Periodic Array of Cylinders, across Weissenberg numbers $0.5<\\text{Wi}<30$ and low Reynolds numbers ($\\text{Re}<1$). A final demonstration of flow in a 2D porous medium highlights LHMM's capability to handle highly heterogeneous geometries. The LHMM is implemented in LAMMPS, making it suitable for integrating multiple models to describe microscales.

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics.

This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels.

A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise. Classical dual-process effects--rapid intuitive responses and slower deliberative reasoning--emerge naturally from metric-induced anisotropies that generate intrinsic time-scale separations and geometric phase transitions, without invoking modular or hybrid architectures. We derive analytical conditions for these regimes and demonstrate their behavioural signatures through simulations of canonical cognitive tasks.

Conjugate heat transfer through the tank walls is accounted for by solving the heat-conduction equation in the solid domain rather than prescribing external heat-flux conditions. The framework is validated against laboratory-scale LN2 and large-scale LH2 experiments, reproducing the spatio-temporal evolution of pressure and temperature without adjustable parameters. In both settings, the simulations identify two distinct regimes in self-pressurization: an initial heating-driven phase that establishes a self-similar temperature profile in the vapor, followed by an evaporation-driven phase in which the pressure rise is governed by the saturation relation. The comparison between these largely different scales motivated a revised scaling for self-pressurization, based on ullage thermodynamics. Finally, the influence of buoyancy was examined by reducing the strength of the gravitational body force, which revealed that natural convection modifies the duration of the transient heating phase but has a limited impact on the long-term pressurization rate. This analysis also clarifies the mechanism controlling the development of thermal stratification in the liquid. Overall, the segregated approach provides a predictive, parameter-free tool for analyzing cryogenic storage and offers a physically grounded basis for scaling self-pressurization across fluids, geometries, and heat-flux conditions."}

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

As stratification increases, mean profiles evolve toward piecewise-linear shapes while layered density structures emerge, with sharp interfaces separating well-mixed bulk layers. These highly stable interfaces form in the low-shear regions of the mean velocity profile and tend to promote flow relaminarisation, while shear-generated turbulence persists in the bulk layers. We analyse turbulent fluctuations, buoyancy transport and its spatial organisation, and flow stability via profiles of the gradient Richardson number $Ri_g$. The Richardson number in the bulk layers remains of order unity or less, $Ri_g \\lesssim 1$, so that efficient turbulent shear production can take place there. Mixing efficiency analysis shows that the Nusselt number scales with the buoyancy Reynolds number $Re_b$ as $Nu = 1 + ΓRe_b$ (with $Γ= ε_p / ε$), with the data collapsing onto a robust master curve and roughly following a power-law $Nu \\sim Re_b^{0.8}$. Further increase of stratification leads to a temporally intermittent turbulent regime, characterised by quasi-periodic bursts. We propose that the transition from stationary turbulence to this temporally intermittent regime is controlled by the buoyancy Reynolds number and highlight the mechanisms disrupting the turbulence and layered structures."}

Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods."}

As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs.

We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes. Our results demonstrate significant practical gains: a 3-5x improvement in successfully identifying potentially stable candidates in high-divergence regions (e.g., correlated oxides) compared to DFT-only baselines, while maintaining computational feasibility.

In this study, we identify linear operators that characterize the behavior of fluid systems across a wide parameter range by using flow field datasets at several representative parameter values. We then comprehensively assess the applicability of ROMs constructed through the interpolation of these operators. Specifically, we consider two intrusive operator-based ROMs: one derived from Galerkin projection and the other based on operator inference using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The performance of these ROMs is evaluated for flows around circular and elliptical cylinders over a range of Reynolds numbers and aspect ratios. The Galerkin-based ROM successfully predicts only the eigenvalue and eigenmode corresponding to the fundamental frequency of the Kármán vortex shedding, while other frequencies are not captured and show a decaying behavior. In contrast, the DMD-based ROM accurately predicts both the fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics. Furthermore, visualization of the linear operator matrix elements reveals that interpolation fails when the subspace includes bases contaminated by numerical errors. However, by carefully selecting the subspace dimension and reference conditions, it is possible to accurately predict eigenvalues and corresponding modes even under conditions where multiple low-frequency modes exist outside the harmonic structure of the fundamental frequency. These findings underscore the robustness of the DMD-based parametric operator ROM approach."}

Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths. It further enhances the reasoning process by incorporating structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which prioritizes paths that reinforce each other.

The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester (Machine Learning for Hydrodynamic Stability, arXiv:2407.09572), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis."}

We test the robustness of these claims. First, we reproduce Anthropic's multi-turn \"emergent introspection\" result on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, finding that the model identifies and names the injected concept 20 percent of the time under Anthropic's original pipeline, exactly matching their reported numbers and thus showing that introspection is not exclusive to very large or capable models. Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

In all tested cases, the student model preserved the teacher's physical accuracy, with a mean RMSE increase below 0.64%, and achieved inference speedups ranging from 4.8x (Navier-Stokes) to 6.9x (Burgers).

The analysis combines time-resolved experimental measurements with physics-based linear models, using mean fields previously assimilated from the same dataset as base flows. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition reveals coherent dynamics in low- and medium-frequency regimes for both flows, with the low-frequency dynamics being substantially stronger in the separated case. In the separated flow, these dynamics are linked to a three-dimensional zero-frequency modal instability that generates large-scale streaks downstream of the bump. A standing-wave model based on resolvent modes, incorporating sidewall effects, reproduces the experimentally observed spanwise structure of the dynamics and highlights the limitations of simulations with small spanwise extent and periodic boundary conditions. In the attached flow, similar low-frequency streaks are identified. These are weaker, do not form a prominent standing-wave pattern, and cannot be definitively classified as either modal or non-modal. The three-dimensional zero-frequency instability and finite-span standing-wave dynamics, identified as the main drivers of low-frequency coherent structures in the separated flow, offer an explanation for persistent discrepancies between simulations and experiments on the Gaussian bump, and provide guidance on spanwise domain size and boundary conditions for future simulations."}

Across six studies (N = 1365), we developed and validated the 13-item critical thinking in AI use scale and mapped its nomological network. Study 1 generated and content-validated scale items. Study 2 supported a three-factor structure (Verification, Motivation, and Reflection).

Studies 3 and 4 further revealed that critical thinking in AI use was positively associated with openness, extraversion, positive trait affect, and frequency of AI use. Lastly, Study 6 demonstrated criterion validity of the scale, with higher critical thinking in AI use scores predicting more frequent and diverse verification strategies, greater veracity-judgement accuracy in a novel and naturalistic ChatGPT-powered fact-checking task, and deeper reflection about responsible AI.

Accurate prediction of the effects of turbulence on the rate of reactant conversion, and the subsequent influence of chemistry on hydrodynamics remain a challenge in combustion modeling. The key issue in DNS is to account for the wide range of temporal and spatial physical scales that are caused by complex interactions of turbulence and chemistry. In this work, a new computational methodology is developed that is shown to provide a viable alternative to DNS. The framework is the matrix product state (MPS), a form of tensor network (TN) as used in computational many body physics. The MPS is a well-established ansatz for efficiently representing many types of quantum states in condensed matter systems, allowing for an exponential compression of the required memory compared to exact diagonalization methods. Due to the success of MPS in quantum physics, the ansatz has been adapted to problems outside its historical domain, notably computational fluid dynamics. Here, the MPS is used for computational simulation of a shear flow under non-reacting and nonpremixed chemically reacting conditions. Reductions of 30% in memory are demonstrated for all transport variables, accompanied by excellent agreements with DNS. The anastaz accurately captures all pertinent flow physics such as reduced mixing due to exothermicity & compressibility, and the formation of eddy shocklets at high Mach numbers. A priori analysis of DNS data at higher Reynolds numbers shows compressions as large as 99.99% for some of the transport variables. This level of compression is encouraging and promotes the use of MPS for simulations of complex turbulent combustion systems."}

We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape.

Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring. CreativeVR achieves state-of-the-art results on videos with severe artifacts and performs competitively on standard video restoration benchmarks, while running at practical throughput (about 13 FPS at 720p on a single 80-GB A100).

Text-to-image systems such as DALL.E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney can now convert ideas into visuals within seconds, but they also present a dual-use dilemma, raising critical ethical concerns: amplifying societal biases, producing high-fidelity disinformation, and violating intellectual property. This paper introduces SafeGen, a framework that embeds ethical safeguards directly into the text-to-image generation pipeline, grounding its design in established principles for Trustworthy AI. SafeGen integrates two complementary components: BGE-M3, a fine-tuned text classifier that filters harmful or misleading prompts, and Hyper-SD, an optimized diffusion model that produces high fidelity, semantically aligned images. Built on a curated multilingual (English- Vietnamese) dataset and a fairness-aware training process, SafeGen demonstrates that creative freedom and ethical responsibility can be reconciled within a single workflow. Quantitative evaluations confirm its effectiveness, with Hyper-SD achieving IS = 3.52, FID = 22.08, and SSIM = 0.79, while BGE-M3 reaches an F1-Score of 0.81. An ablation study further validates the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for both modules. Case studies illustrate SafeGen's practical impact in blocking unsafe prompts, generating inclusive teaching materials, and reinforcing academic integrity."}

However, their performance is often crippled by \"Context Explosion\", where the accumulation of long text outputs overwhelms the model's context window and leads to reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent, a simple but effective reinforcement learning framework that decouples high-level planning from low-level execution. It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload."}

To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents."}

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives."}

These approaches inject the rich semantics from high-dimensional VFM representations (e.g., DINOv3) into LDMs at different phases, resulting in accelerated learning and better generation performance. However, the high-dimensionality of VFM representations may also lead to Information Overload, particularly when the VFM features exceed the size of the original image for decoding. To address this issue while preserving the utility of VFM features, we propose RePack (Representation Packing), a simple yet effective framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). RePack transforms the VFM representation into a more compact, decoder-friendly representation by projecting onto low-dimensional manifolds. We find that RePack can effectively filter out non-semantic noise while preserving the core structural information needed for high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results show that RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms recent methods that directly inject raw VFM features into the decoder for image reconstruction. On DiT-XL/2, RePack achieves an FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, which is 35% faster than the state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates that RePack successfully extracts the core semantics of VFM representations while bypassing their high-dimensionality side effects."}

Although this model has been widely used to make predictions in behavioral ecology, discovering the computational mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of optimal patch-foraging decisions in biological foragers remains under investigation. Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems.

However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: \"You are being probed for {concept}\". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks. Using Gemma-2-9b-it as a case study, a mechanistic analysis reveals this is achieved via a targeted manipulation that moves activations into a low-dimensional subspace. While stronger defenses like monitor ensembles and non-linear classifiers show greater resilience, the model retains a non-trivial evasion capability. Our work provides a proof-of-concept for this failure mode and a tool to evaluate the worst-case robustness of monitoring techniques against misalignment threat models."}

However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations."}

This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions."}

We then investigate the effects of dialogue length on persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety of seven state-of-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs. We find that persona fidelity degrades over the course of dialogues, especially in goal-oriented conversations, where models must sustain both persona fidelity and instruction following. We identify a trade-off between fidelity and instruction following, with non-persona baselines initially outperforming persona-assigned models; as dialogues progress and fidelity fades, persona responses become increasingly similar to baseline responses.

Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak.

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications."}

SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens.

Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice."}

However, current evaluation practices for GUI agents face two fundamental limitations. First, they either rely on single path offline benchmarks or online live benchmarks. Offline benchmarks using static, single path annotated datasets unfairly penalize valid alternative actions, while online benchmarks suffer from poor scalability and reproducibility due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of live evaluation. Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we present MobiBench, the first modular and multi path aware offline benchmarking framework for mobile GUI agents that enables high fidelity, scalable, and reproducible evaluation entirely in offline settings. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiBench achieves 94.72 percent agreement with human evaluators, on par with carefully engineered online benchmarks, while preserving the scalability and reproducibility of static offline benchmarks. Furthermore, our comprehensive module level analysis uncovers several key insights, including a systematic evaluation of diverse techniques used in mobile GUI agents, optimal module configurations across model scales, the inherent limitations of current LFMs, and actionable guidelines for designing more capable and cost efficient mobile agents."}

Evaluating Prompt Politeness Effects on Modern LLMs: GPT, Gemini, LLaMA", "comment": null, "summary": "Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical factor influencing large language model (LLM) performance, yet the impact of pragmatic elements such as linguistic tone and politeness remains underexplored, particularly across different model families. In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.\n  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments."}

While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved broad success in natural images and certain medical domains, their potential in echocardiography has been limited by the lack of large-scale, clinically grounded image-text datasets and the absence of measurement-based reasoning central to echo interpretation. We introduce EchoGround-MIMIC, the first measurement-grounded multimodal echocardiography dataset, comprising 19,065 image-text pairs from 1,572 patients with standardized views, structured measurements, measurement-grounded captions, and guideline-derived disease labels. Building on this resource, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model that incorporates two novel pretraining objectives: (i) a view-informed contrastive loss that encodes the view-dependent structure of echocardiographic imaging, and (ii) a negation-aware contrastive loss that distinguishes clinically critical negative from positive findings. Across five types of clinical applications with 36 tasks spanning multimodal disease classification, image-text retrieval, view classification, chamber segmentation, and landmark detection, EchoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.5% AUC in zero-shot disease classification and 95.1% accuracy in view classification). We demonstrate that clinically grounded multimodal pretraining yields transferable visual representations and establish EchoVLM as a foundation model for end-to-end echocardiography interpretation.

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition.

Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets. Finally, we provide a convenient python package, Patch-TDA, to facilitate the utilization of the proposed approach."}

We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships.

Testing four instruction-tuned models from three families (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 3 8B, Gemma 3 12B) on 876 harmful prompts across 20 different sampling configurations (4 temperatures x 5 random seeds), we find that 18-28% of prompts exhibit decision flips--the model refuses in some configurations but complies in others--depending on the model. Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62).

While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road.

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

In this work, we develop a methodology for addressing inverse problems in infinite and semi infinite domains. We introduce a novel sampling strategy for the network's training points, using the negative exponential and normal distributions, alongside a dual network architecture that is trained to learn the solution and parameters of an equation with the same loss function. This design enables the solution of inverse problems without explicitly imposing boundary conditions, as long as the solutions tend to stabilize when leaving the domain of interest. The proposed architecture is implemented using both PINNs and PIKANs, and their performance is compared in terms of accuracy with respect to a known solution as well as computational time and response to a noisy environment. Our results demonstrate that, in this setting, PINNs provide a more accurate and computationally efficient solution, solving the inverse problem 1,000 times faster and in the same order of magnitude, yet with a lower relative error than PIKANs."}

We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as \"ground truth\", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.).

To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft.

Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations. The experimental results show that this human-in-the-loop, multi-agent workflow not only improves the precision and consistency of multilingual legal terminology mapping but also offers greater scalability compared to traditional manual methods."}

For example, in biomedical research, uncovering meaningful patterns in physiological signals can improve diagnosis, risk assessment, and patient outcomes. However, existing methods for time series pattern discovery face major challenges, including high computational complexity, limited interpretability, and difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal structures. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system -- SigTIme -- with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation. We quantitatively evaluate our learning framework on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through two usage scenarios along with the domain experts: one involving public ECG data and the other focused on preterm labor analysis."}

We introduce a behaviorally realistic demographic based data augmentation strategy that expands a small QoE dataset six fold by modeling varying user sensitivities to streaming impairments such as rebuffering, bitrate variation, and quality degradation. Using the augmented dataset, we evaluate a comprehensive set of classical machine learning models alongside advanced deep learning architectures, including an attention-based MLP and TabNet.\n  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy across RMSE, MAE, and R metrics compared to baseline models. Among all evaluated approaches, TabNet achieves the strongest performance, benefiting from its inherent feature selection and attention mechanisms.

By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average.

We propose Cloak, a novel data obfuscation framework based on latent diffusion models. In contrast to prior work, we employ contrastive learning to extract disentangled representations, which guide the latent diffusion process to retain useful information while concealing private information. This approach enables users with diverse privacy needs to navigate the privacy-utility trade-off with minimal retraining. Extensive experiments on four public time-series datasets, spanning multiple sensing modalities, and a dataset of facial images demonstrate that Cloak consistently outperforms state-of-the-art obfuscation techniques and is well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained settings."}

My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly.

To address this, we propose SMRABooth, which leverages the self-supervised encoder and optical flow encoder to provide object-level subject and motion representations. These representations are aligned with the model during the LoRA fine-tuning process. Our approach is structured in three core stages: (1) We exploit subject representations via a self-supervised encoder to guide subject alignment, enabling the model to capture overall structure of subject and enhance high-level semantic consistency. (2) We utilize motion representations from an optical flow encoder to capture structurally coherent and object-level motion trajectories independent of appearance. (3) We propose a subject-motion association decoupling strategy that applies sparse LoRAs injection across both locations and timing, effectively reducing interference between subject and motion LoRAs.

To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors.

Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction."}

However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\\% in KV-Retrieval tasks."}

Under a Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model, we propose high-dimensional CP low-rank Tensor Discriminant Analysis (CP-TDA) with Randomized Composite PCA (\\textsc{rc-PCA}) initialization, that is essential for handling dependent and anisotropic noise under weaker signal strength and incoherence conditions, followed by iterative refinement algorithm. We establish global convergence and minimax-optimal misclassification rates.\n  To handle tensor data deviating from tensor normality, we develop the first semiparametric tensor discriminant model, in which learned tensor representations are mapped via deep generative models into a latent space tailored for CP-TDA. Misclassification risk decomposes into representation, approximation, and estimation errors. Numerical studies and real data analysis on graph classification demonstrate substantial gains over existing tensor classifiers and state-of-the-art graph neural networks, particularly in high-dimensional, small-sample regimes."}

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment."}

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD.

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."}

Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency."}

AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples.

Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image.

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone. The proposed framework jointly denoises full multi-day trajectories in a single pass, ensuring temporal coherence and mitigating error accumulation common in autoregressive prediction. HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting. These results establish HydroDiffusion as a robust generative modeling framework for medium-range streamflow forecasting, providing both a new modeling benchmark and a foundation for future research on probabilistic hydrologic prediction at continental scales."}

This is typically achieved by transferring visual-attribute relationships from seen classes to unseen classes. The core challenge is attribute entanglement, where conventional models collapse distinct attributes like color, shape, and texture into a single visual embedding. This causes interference that masks these critical distinctions. The post-hoc solutions of previous work are insufficient, as they operate on representations that are already mixed. We propose a zero-shot learning framework that learns AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) to tackle this problem by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning. ACR is achieved with two mixture-of-experts components, including Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE). First, MoPE is inserted into the transformer using a dual-level routing mechanism to conditionally dispatch image patches to specialized experts. This ensures coherent attribute families are processed by dedicated experts. Finally, the MoAE head projects these expert-refined features into sparse, partaware attribute maps for robust zero-shot classification. On zero-shot learning benchmark datasets CUB, AwA2, and SUN, our ACR achieves consistent state-of-the-art results."}

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms."}

This paper introduces MiniLingua, a multilingual open-source LLM of one billion parameters trained from scratch for 13 European languages, designed to balance coverage and instruction-following capabilities. Based on evaluation results, the instruction-tuned version of MiniLingua outperforms EuroLLM, a model with a similar training approach but a larger training budget, on summarization, classification and both open- and closed-book question answering. Moreover, it remains competitive with more advanced state-of-the-art models on open-ended generation tasks.

Recent advances in computer vision introduced a range of new guidance strategies for generative models, many of which can be adapted to support these goals. In this work, we integrate state-of-the-art guidance methods -- including classifier-free guidance, autoguidance, and model guidance -- in a leading molecule generation framework built on an SE(3)-equivariant flow matching process. We propose a hybrid guidance strategy that separately guides continuous and discrete molecular modalities -- operating on velocity fields and predicted logits, respectively -- while jointly optimizing their guidance scales via Bayesian optimization. Our implementation, benchmarked on the QM9 and QMe14S datasets, achieves new state-of-the-art performance in property alignment for de novo molecular generation. The generated molecules also exhibit high structural validity.

To quantify the progress, we introduce ProImage-Bench, a rubric-based benchmark that targets biology schematics, engineering/patent drawings, and general scientific diagrams. For 654 figures collected from real textbooks and technical reports, we construct detailed image instructions and a hierarchy of rubrics that decompose correctness into 6,076 criteria and 44,131 binary checks. Rubrics are derived from surrounding text and reference figures using large multimodal models, and are evaluated by an automated LMM-based judge with a principled penalty scheme that aggregates sub-question outcomes into interpretable criterion scores. We benchmark several representative text-to-image models on ProImage-Bench and find that, despite strong open-domain performance, the best base model reaches only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score overall, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Finally, we show that the same rubrics provide actionable supervision: feeding failed checks back into an editing model for iterative refinement boosts a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score. ProImage-Bench thus offers both a rigorous diagnostic for professional image generation and a scalable signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations."}

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication."}

EEG-DLite begins by encoding EEG segments into compact latent representations using a self-supervised autoencoder, allowing sample selection to be performed efficiently and with reduced sensitivity to noise. Based on these representations, EEG-DLite filters out outliers and minimizes redundancy, resulting in a smaller yet informative subset that retains the diversity essential for effective foundation model training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training on only 5 percent of a 2,500-hour dataset curated with EEG-DLite yields performance comparable to, and in some cases better than, training on the full dataset across multiple downstream tasks.

Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation. Overall, SynthSeg provided the most reliable volumetric and FD results for paediatric MRI, yet small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted with caution due to segmentation-related uncertainty."}

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions."}

Existing frameworks typically rely on large pretrained encoders (e.g., VAEs or tokenizer-based models) and perform transform coding within their generative latent space. While these approaches achieve impressive perceptual fidelity, their reliance on heavy encoder networks makes them unsuitable for deployment on weak sender devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate compression and propose a novel Asymmetric Extreme Image Compression (AEIC) framework that pursues simultaneously encoding simplicity and decoding quality. Specifically, AEIC employs moderate or even shallow encoder networks, while leveraging an one-step diffusion decoder to maintain high-fidelity and high-realism reconstructions under extreme bitrates. To further enhance the efficiency of shallow encoders, we design a dual-side feature distillation scheme that transfers knowledge from AEIC with moderate encoders to its shallow encoder variants. Experiments demonstrate that AEIC not only outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates, but also delivers exceptional encoding efficiency for 35.8 FPS on 1080P input images, while maintaining competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods."}

Although recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempt to address the issue, we propose a novel approach by applying segmentation objectives directly on the LLM's output tokens. The LLM is fed with a fixed number of frames alongside a prompt that enforces it to output a sequence of continuous \"0\" and/or \"1\" characters, with one character per frame. The \"0\"/\"1\" characters benefit from the LLM's inherent language capability while also acting as background and foreground probabilities, respectively. Training employs segmentation losses on the probabilities alongside a normal causal LM loss. At inference, beam search generates sequence and logits, acting as moments and saliency scores, respectively. Despite sampling only 25 frames -- less than half of comparable methods -- our method achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights. Additionally, our efficient method scores above the baseline (35.28 MAP) for moment retrieval.

This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks."}

Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget."}

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography."}

The auxiliary task dynamically learns parameterized augmentations for each sample, enabling more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains. MetaTPT adopts a dual-loop optimization paradigm: an inner loop learns a self-supervised task that generates informative views, while the outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these views.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

Facial expression recognition (FER) provides a primary channel for inferring affective states, but the dynamic and culturally nuanced nature of emotions requires models that can learn continuously without forgetting prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for FER in a continual learning setting that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates two complementary modalities: deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The combined representation is modelled through Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs), which provide a lightweight, probabilistic solution that avoids retraining while offering strong discriminative power. Using the Compound Facial Expression of Emotion (CFEE) dataset, we show that our model can first learn basic expressions and then progressively recognize compound expressions. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, stronger knowledge retention, and reduced forgetting. This framework contributes to the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems with applications in education, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces."}

While recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often function as iterative optimizers within a search loop, rather than generating architectures directly from a holistic understanding of the data. To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks. Crucially, our ablation studies prove that the LLM's data-driven reasoning is the primary driver of performance, demonstrating that a deep understanding of data \"first principles\" is more critical for achieving a superior architecture than simply retrieving SOTA components."}

This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance."}

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints."}

For every path in a natural ``Ville event'' $E_α$, this regret till time $T$ is bounded by $\\ln^2(1/α)/V_T + \\ln (1/α) + \\ln \\ln V_T$ up to universal constants, where $V_T$ is a nonnegative, nondecreasing, cumulative variance process. (The bound reduces to $\\ln(1/α) + \\ln \\ln V_T$ if $V_T \\geq \\ln(1/α)$.) If the data were stochastic, then one can show that $E_α$ has probability at least $1-α$ under a wide class of distributions (eg: sub-Gaussian, symmetric, variance-bounded, etc.). In fact, we show that on the Ville event $E_0$ of probability one, the regret on every path in $E_0$ is eventually bounded by $\\ln \\ln V_T$ (up to constants). We explain how this work helps bridge the world of adversarial online learning (which usually deals with regret bounds for bounded data), with game-theoretic statistics (which can handle unbounded data, albeit using stochastic assumptions).

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."}

Various uncertainty measures have been proposed for this purpose, typically claiming superiority over other measures. In this paper, we argue that there is no single best measure. Instead, uncertainty quantification should be tailored to the specific application. To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures."}

We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and several transfer learning benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, CARS, and INAT-19, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over current TAS methods"}

(2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues.

We conduct an early-stage scaling-law analysis of continued pretraining on U.S. SEC filings, training 1B and 3B-parameter Llama-3.2 models on a 400M-token financial corpus with validation checkpoints at 50M, 100M, 200M, and 400M tokens. Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation. Together, these findings provide early empirical guidance for scaling financial foundation models, suggesting that meaningful domain adaptation can be achieved with comparatively modest token budgets and that larger model scales (7B-70B) remain tractable under projected data requirements."}

However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%."}

To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality.

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

However, current adaptations of GRPO for the flow matching-based image generation neglect a foundational conflict between its core principles and the distinct dynamics of the visual synthesis process. This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses."}

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1).

We investigate whether introducing \\emph{simple graph priors} can enhance \\emph{pretrained tabular transformers}. Concretely, we introduce {BOLERO}, a lightweight, static bipartite graph head that augments {RoBERTa-Tab} (a RoBERTa-style tabular backbone pretrained with masked-token prediction.)

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions.

Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos."}

Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures.

Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers."}

To address these limitations, we introduce V-Warper, a training-free coarse-to-fine personalization framework for transformer-based video diffusion models. The framework enhances fine-grained identity fidelity without requiring any additional video training. (1) A lightweight coarse appearance adaptation stage leverages only a small set of reference images, which are already required for the task. This step encodes global subject identity through image-only LoRA and subject-embedding adaptation. (2) A inference-time fine appearance injection stage refines visual fidelity by computing semantic correspondences from RoPE-free mid-layer query--key features. These correspondences guide the warping of appearance-rich value representations into semantically aligned regions of the generation process, with masking ensuring spatial reliability. V-Warper significantly improves appearance fidelity while preserving prompt alignment and motion dynamics, and it achieves these gains efficiently without large-scale video finetuning."}

This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty.

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

However, current radar datasets are constrained by sparse skeleton labels, limited scale, and simple in-place actions. To advance the HMR research community, we introduce M4Human, the current largest-scale (661K-frame) ($9\\times$ prior largest) multimodal benchmark, featuring high-resolution mmWave radar, RGB, and depth data.

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems."}

Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities.

To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers.

Existing generative models often rely on single-view inputs representing closed states, resulting in ambiguous or unrealistic kinematic structures due to the entanglement between geometric shape and joint dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtGen, a conditional diffusion-based framework capable of generating articulated 3D objects with accurate geometry and coherent kinematics from single-view images or text descriptions at arbitrary part-level states. Specifically, ArtGen employs cross-state Monte Carlo sampling to explicitly enforce global kinematic consistency, reducing structural-motion entanglement. Additionally, we integrate a Chain-of-Thought reasoning module to infer robust structural priors, such as part semantics, joint types, and connectivity, guiding a sparse-expert Diffusion Transformer to specialize in diverse kinematic interactions. Furthermore, a compositional 3D-VAE latent prior enhanced with local-global attention effectively captures fine-grained geometry and global part-level relationships. Extensive experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that ArtGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP).

Testing four instruction-tuned models from three families (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 3 8B, Gemma 3 12B) on 876 harmful prompts across 20 different sampling configurations (4 temperatures x 5 random seeds), we find that 18-28% of prompts exhibit decision flips--the model refuses in some configurations but complies in others--depending on the model. Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62).

Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements.

We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate).

However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations."}

We demonstrate that static demographic features dominate predictions (68% importance), enabling assessment-free early prediction. The LSTM model achieves 97% recall at Week 2, making it ideal for early intervention, while Decision Tree provides stable balanced performance (78% accuracy) during mid-course. By Week 20, both models converge to similar recall (68%), but LSTM achieves higher precision (90% vs 86%).

We introduce BokehDepth, a two-stage framework that decouples bokeh synthesis from depth prediction and treats defocus as an auxiliary supervision-free geometric cue. In Stage-1, a physically guided controllable bokeh generator, built on a powerful pretrained image editing backbone, produces depth-free bokeh stacks with calibrated bokeh strength from a single sharp input. In Stage-2, a lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module plugs into existing monocular depth encoders, fuses features along the defocus dimension, and exposes stable depth-sensitive variations while leaving downstream decoder unchanged. Across challenging benchmarks, BokehDepth improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts the metric accuracy and robustness of strong monocular depth foundation models."}

Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image.

In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.\n  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance. Our simulator also allows us to evaluate the effect of critical, and often unexplored, factors in the allocation, such as geographic proximity and the tendency to reject offers by the transplant centers."}

This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference.

Photon mapping provides physically grounded estimates of complex global illumination effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, yet its per-view radiance estimation remains computationally inefficient when rendering multiple views of the same scene. The inefficiency arises from independent photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation at each viewpoint, leading to inevitable redundant computation. To accelerate multi-view rendering, we reformulate photon mapping as a continuous and reusable radiance function. Specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), a learnable representation that encodes photon distributions as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum. GPF is initialized from physically traced photons in the first SPPM iteration and optimized using multi-view supervision of final radiance, distilling photon-based light transport into a continuous field. Once trained, the field enables differentiable radiance evaluation along camera rays without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement. Extensive experiments on scenes with complex light transport, such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, demonstrate that GPF attains photon-level accuracy while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, unifying the physical rigor of photon-based rendering with the efficiency of neural scene representations."}

Our research deviates from previous studies that identified impacts of keywords and sentiments - we expand on that method by a sequence of topic modeling, temporal analysis, breakpoint detection and segment optimization to detect the optimal time period for training. This results in improving predictions by providing the model with nuanced patterns that occur from that era's socioeconomic and political status while also resolving the shortage of pertinent stock data to train on.

Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos."}

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series."}

Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter.

A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation.

Small shifts in the behavior of these users are often sufficient to propagate widely throughout the network. A similar phenomenon occurs during neural network fine tuning. Conventional fine tuning of convolutional neural networks typically adds a new linear classification layer on top of a large pre trained model. Instead we argue that improved adaptation can be achieved by first pruning the network to retain only the most important neurons and then performing fine tuning.\n  We propose a graph theory based method for pruning neural networks that is designed to improve fine tuning performance. In this method each neuron is represented as a node and edges encode similarity between neurons. Neurons are pruned based on importance scores computed using eigenvector centrality. The resulting pruned network is then fine tuned using only the most central neurons. We evaluate the proposed method on VGGNet EfficientNet and ResNet models using the TF Flowers Caltech one zero one and Oxford Flowers one zero two datasets. The proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy while significantly reducing model complexity.

Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the \"platinum minutes\" and the broader \"golden hour\" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care."}

We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $Ω(\\sqrt{d})$. This constitutes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of $Ω(\\log\\log d)$, $Ω(\\sqrt{\\log d})$, and $Ω(\\log d)$, due respectively to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023).

Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving.

Previous methods mostly leverage the vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) objective to distill motion from pretrained text-to-video diffusion, leading to animations with minimal movement or noticeable jitter. To address this, our approach introduces a novel SDS alternative, Motion Score Distillation (MSD). Specifically, we introduce a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model that defines a static source distribution rather than pure noise as in SDS, while another inversion-based noise estimation technique ensures appearance preservation when guiding motion. To further improve motion fidelity, we incorporate explicit temporal and spatial regularization terms that mitigate geometric distortions across time and space. Additionally, we propose a motion refinement module to upscale the temporal resolution and enhance fine-grained details, overcoming the fixed-resolution constraints of the underlying video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity.

Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences."}

No claims of quantum advantage", "summary": "This paper presents an exploratory, simulator-based proof of concept investigating whether differentiable energy terms derived from parameterized quantum circuits can serve as auxiliary regularization signals in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We augment the Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) generator objective with a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)-inspired energy term computed from class-specific Ising Hamiltonians using Qiskit's EstimatorQNN and TorchConnector.\n  Important limitations: All experiments run on a noiseless statevector simulator with only 4 qubits, use a deliberately simple Hamiltonian parameterization, and lack ablation studies comparing against equivalent classical biases. The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.\n  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96. Extended runs stabilize around FID 23 to 24, comparable to the ACGAN baseline.\n  We explicitly do not claim quantum advantage, improved stability in any general sense, or scalability beyond this toy setting. The contribution is methodological: demonstrating that VQE-style energy computations can be integrated into GAN training loops via differentiable pathways. Whether such auxiliary signals provide benefits beyond equivalent classical regularizers remains an open question requiring systematic ablation studies, which we leave for future work."}

Nevertheless, reliable segmentation remains challenging because of small vessel calibers, complex branching, blurred boundaries, and myocardial interference. We propose a coronary artery segmentation framework that integrates myocardial anatomical priors, structure aware feature encoding, and three dimensional wavelet inverse wavelet transformations. Myocardial priors and residual attention based feature enhancement are incorporated during encoding to strengthen coronary structure representation. Wavelet inverse wavelet based downsampling and upsampling enable joint spatial frequency modeling and preserve multi scale structural consistency, while a multi scale feature fusion module integrates semantic and geometric information in the decoding stage. The model is trained and evaluated on the public ImageCAS dataset using a 3D overlapping patch based strategy with a 7:1:2 split for training, validation, and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.8082, Sensitivity of 0.7946, Precision of 0.8471, and an HD95 of 9.77 mm, outperforming several mainstream segmentation models.

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

By leveraging the rank-1 structure of the dynamics matrix, we directly derive the exact closed-form solution effectively corresponding to the infinite-order Runge-Kutta method. This attention mechanism is theoretically free from error accumulation, perfectly capturing the continuous dynamics while preserving the linear-time complexity.

This design enables the use of pre trained convolutional neural network backbones such as ResNet50 and avoids the computational overhead of complex video transformer models. We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model. Positive pairs are defined as projections from videos sharing the same label while all other projections are treated as negatives. Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video. Rather than relying on data augmentation these frame level variations produce diverse positive samples with global context and reduce overfitting. Experiments on the Penn Action and HMDB51 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in classification accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. The proposed Supervised Contrastive Frame Aggregation method learns effective video representations in both supervised and self supervised settings and supports video based tasks such as classification and captioning.

While the broader system contains independent modules for potato, apple, and corn, this study isolates cactus-fig model performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer on indigenous morphology alone. Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels.

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components."}

Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality.

Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD.

This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality.

We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability.

These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines."}

This is the extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI 2026, including related works and appendix", "summary": "Despite the rapid progress of deep learning in video action recognition (VAR) in recent years, privacy leakage in videos remains a critical concern. Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models."}

This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD.

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions. Empirical evaluations on vision, text, and audio benchmarks indicate improved generalization relative to the standard noise-based regularizer."}

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives."}

Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance. On average, compared to the second-best models, DynaGen improves the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation."}

Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning."}

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis."}

This work introduces a novel paradigm that uses surrogate models to create simpler, faster, and more flexible approximations of these dynamics.

Our experiments on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation demonstrate that these surrogates achieve competitive performance while offering dramatic improvements in efficiency and interpretability.

To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based \"placement plan\" based on this analysis. In the second step, that plan is rendered into the final layout by generating HTML-format code. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation experiments, conducting both quantitative and qualitative comparisons against existing methods. The results demonstrate that by explicitly considering the background image's content, our method produces noticeably higher-quality advertisement layouts."}

Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs."}

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."}

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components."}

Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods."}

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition.

In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history. To put our method into practice, we represent the joint distribution over tasks and rewards using a particle-based approximation of a log-density Gaussian process. This representation enables flexible, data-driven discovery of both inter-arm and inter-task dependencies without prior assumptions on the latent variables.

Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines.

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions."}

While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters."}

In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios."}

The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle.

However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency."}

Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."}

We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023.

Measuring Envy-Like Preferences in Multi-Agent Settings", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Envy is a common human behavior that shapes competitiveness and can alter outcomes in team settings. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems."}

Structural pruning, which reduces model size by removing redundant computational units such as neurons, has been widely explored as a solution, and this study devotes to input sparsification, an increasingly popular technique that improves efficiency by selectively activating only a subset of entry values for each input. However, existing approaches focus primarily on computational savings, often overlooking the representational consequences of sparsification and leaving a noticeable performance gap compared to full models. In this work, we first reinterpret input sparsification as a form of dynamic structural pruning. Motivated by the spontaneous baseline firing rates observed in biological neurons, we introduce a small set of trainable spontaneous neurons that act as compensatory units to stabilize activations in sparsified LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that these auxiliary neurons substantially reduce the sparsification-induced performance gap while generalizing effectively across tasks."}

By contrast, this paper is targeted at a more challenging scenario with large FoV disparity, to which directly applying current methods fails. We propose Crop and Alignment for cross-modal fundus image Registration(CARe), a very simple yet effective method. Specifically, given an OCTA with smaller FoV as a source image and a wide-field color fundus photograph (wfCFP) as a target image, our Crop operation exploits the physiological structure of the retina to crop from the target image a sub-image with its FoV roughly aligned with that of the source. This operation allows us to re-purpose the previous small-FoV-disparity oriented methods for subsequent image registration. Moreover, we improve spatial transformation by a double-fitting based Alignment module that utilizes the classical RANSAC algorithm and polynomial-based coordinate fitting in a sequential manner. Extensive experiments on a newly developed test set of 60 OCTA-wfCFP pairs verify the viability of CARe for CMFIR."}

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement.

This paper introduces \"OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Online Regression with Dynamic Weighted Average\", a hyperparameter-free model designed to tackle the challenges of non-stationary data streams and enable effective, continuous adaptation. The objective is to strike a balance between model stability and adaptability.

It further introduces a unique optimization mechanism that dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on real-time data characteristics. Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness. Concept drift datasets reveal a performance gap that OLR-WAA effectively bridges, setting it apart from other online models.

We achieve this by employing a multi-stage training process to learn a unified motion, speech, and prompt embedding space. To support this, we curate a rich human-object interaction dataset, formed by augmenting an existing text-to-motion dataset with detailed object interaction annotations. Our framework utilizes a Generalized Motion Adaptation Module that enables independent training, adapting to the corresponding motion condition, which is then dynamically combined during inference. To address the imbalance between heterogeneous conditioning signals, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy, which dynamically reweights the conditioning signals during diffusion sampling. InteracTalker successfully unifies these previously separate tasks, outperforming prior methods in both co-speech gesture generation and object-interaction synthesis, outperforming gesture-focused diffusion methods, yielding highly realistic, object-aware full-body motions with enhanced realism, flexibility, and control."}

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment."}

However, existing OW-DFA methods face two critical limitations: 1) A confidence skew that leads to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, resulting in biased training. 2) An unrealistic assumption that the number of unknown forgery types is known *a priori*. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios. Extensive experiments on the standard OW-DFA benchmark and a newly extended benchmark incorporating advanced manipulations demonstrate that CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution."}

Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts.

In this work, we find that, when applying a transformer network model to a new target domain, the Query, Key, and Value features of its self-attention module often change significantly from those in the source domain, leading to substantial performance degradation of the transformer model. To address this important issue, we propose to develop a new approach to progressively recalibrate the self-attention at each layer using a local linear transform parameterized by conditioned scale and shift factors. We consider the online model adaptation from the source domain to the target domain as a progressive domain shift separation process. At each transformer network layer, we learn a Domain Separation Network to extract the domain shift feature, which is used to predict the scale and shift parameters for self-attention recalibration using a Factor Generator Network. These two lightweight networks are adapted online during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) method is able to significantly improve the online test-time domain adaptation performance by a large margin of up to 3.9\\% in classification accuracy on the ImageNet-C dataset."}

However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Matérn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze this phenomenon for geometric data, which we represent as discrete samples from a continuous source (e.g., point clouds from manifolds, graphs from graphons). Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent.

We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines."}

We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance. These results offer theoretical and algorithmic foundations for cost-efficient ML model management under concept drift, with implications for continual learning, distributed inference, and adaptive ML systems."}

First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as \"credible\".

The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches.

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

This paper proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing vertical channels using only the current LiDAR frame, with no camera images or temporal information required. Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k.

Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD.

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so."}

The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient.

Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning. More importantly, our approach significantly reduces computational cost without compromising visual quality, bringing 2DGS closer to industry-ready deployment."}

TM, similar to previous paradigms, gradually transforms noise samples to data samples, however it uses a second ``internal'' generative model to implement the transition steps, making the transitions more expressive compared to diffusion and flow models. To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics. Lastly, we believe the experiments presented highlight the design aspects that are likely to provide most quality and efficiency gains, while at the same time indicate what design choices are not likely to provide further gains."}

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance."}

To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise."}

Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization.

We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes.

Given two image datasets, we want to separate the common generative factors, shared across the two datasets, from the salient ones, specific to only one dataset. Compared to existing methods, which use attributes as supervised signals for editing (e.g., glasses, gender), the proposed method is weaker, since it only uses the dataset signal. We propose a novel framework for CA, that can be adapted to both GAN and Diffusion models, to learn both common and salient factors. By defining new and well-adapted learning strategies and losses, we ensure a relevant separation between common and salient factors, preserving a high-quality generation. We evaluate our approach on diverse datasets, covering human faces, animal images and medical scans.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data.

Why Do Reasoning Models Loop?", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning."}

Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods."}

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications. With this detailed modelling of uncertainties, crucial components in vehicle safety systems like criticality estimation and trajectory planning can be improved."}

Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors."}

This classifier is responsible for identifying the type of the road infrastructure and the safety-relevant traffic participants of the driving environment. With each class representing similar traffic scenarios, a set of Random Forests (RFs) is individually trained to predict the probabilistic space-time representation, which depicts the future behavior of traffic participants.

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions. Empirical evaluations on vision, text, and audio benchmarks indicate improved generalization relative to the standard noise-based regularizer."}

These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context.

Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy.

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."}

Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries.

Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks. These results demonstrate that directly leveraging the internal representations of causal LLMs, along with efficient fine-tuning techniques, yields impressive classification performance under limited computational resources. We discuss the advantages of each approach while outlining practical guidelines and future directions for optimizing LLM fine-tuning in classification scenarios."}

We present a diagnostic study using the Amazon Computers co-purchase data to understand when and why GCNs help. Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features. These findings offer practical guidance for practitioners deciding whether to adopt graph-based methods."}

We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities."}

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history.

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes."}

Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy.

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."}

SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens.

However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis."}

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."}

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. This paper introduces Online Classification with Weighted Average (OLC-WA), an adaptive, hyperparameter-free online classification model equipped with an automated optimization mechanism. OLC-WA operates by blending incoming data streams with an existing base model. This blending is facilitated by an exponentially weighted moving average. Furthermore, an integrated optimization mechanism dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on the observed data stream characteristics. This approach empowers the model to effectively adapt to evolving data distributions within streaming environments. Rigorous empirical evaluation across diverse benchmark datasets shows that OLC-WA achieves performance comparable to batch models in stationary environments, maintaining accuracy within 1-3%, and surpasses leading online baselines by 10-25% under drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to dynamic data streams."}

The framework formalizes the ETL scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process and enables adaptive decision-making by a reinforcement learning agent in high-dimensional state spaces to dynamically optimize task allocation and resource scheduling. The model consists of a state representation module, a feature embedding network, a Q-value estimator, and a reward evaluation mechanism, which collectively consider task dependencies, node load states, and data flow characteristics to derive the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to balance key performance indicators such as average scheduling delay, task completion rate, throughput, and resource utilization. Sensitivity experiments further verify the model's robustness under changes in hyperparameters, environmental dynamics, and data scale.

Robust statistical methods are needed to assess the significance of performance differences as data evolves over time. This article examines the state-of-the-art online regression models and empirically evaluates several suitable tests. To compare multiple online regression models across various datasets, we employed the Friedman test along with corresponding post-hoc tests. For thorough evaluations, utilizing both real and synthetic datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and seed averaging ensures comprehensive assessment across various data subsets.

The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data.

In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses.

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions."}

Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis."}

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze this phenomenon for geometric data, which we represent as discrete samples from a continuous source (e.g., point clouds from manifolds, graphs from graphons). Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent. We prove that for Transformers with stable positional encodings, this bound is determined by the sampling density and the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Experiments on graphs and point clouds of various sizes confirm the tightness of our theoretical bound."}

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data.

However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods."}

In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.\n  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments."}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions."}

Unlike prior work that relies on modality-specific encoders and cross-modal alignment modules, this design enables early spatial-linguistic fusion, eliminates redundant encoders, improves parameter efficiency, and supports more effective model scaling. To handle the complexity of 3D data, we develop a structured patchification and tokenization scheme that preserves spatial context, and a three-stage training curriculum that progressively builds capabilities from object-level recognition to scene-level spatial reasoning.

The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $τ$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target. Finally, we formulate the Soft Actor-Critic with n-step returns (SAC$n$) algorithm that we experimentally verify on MuJoCo simulated environments."}

Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an \"augmentation divergence\": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models."}

This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy. By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies."}

In the training environment, the convolutional neural network long short term memory model achieved the highest accuracy, while traditional machine learning models provided moderate performance. In a new layout, however, all learning based methods showed significant degradation, whereas the rule-based method remained stable. Notably, for binary detection of presence versus absence of people, all models consistently achieved high accuracy across layouts. These results demonstrate that high capacity models can produce fine grained outputs with high accuracy in the same environment, but they are vulnerable to domain shift. In contrast, rule-based methods cannot provide fine grained outputs but exhibit robustness against domain shift. Moreover, regardless of the model type, a clear trade off was revealed between spatial generalization performance and output granularity."}

We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation."}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity."}

While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K.

While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks.

We study this through questions from MedQA, where the task is to select the most likely diagnosis. We introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that scores options with a smoothed Naive Bayes over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization. While the performance of LLMs seems to be driven by a mechanism other than simple frequency aggregation, we show that an approach similar to the historically grounded, low-complexity expert systems still accounts for a substantial portion of benchmark performance."}

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, CORE surpasses GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 by up to 2.80% and 3.72% on node classification tasks, and by up to 3.82% and 3.76% on graph classification tasks."}

Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males."}

AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling method to identify the best query points, reducing the impact of label noise on classifier performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to several benchmark methods."}

However, sparse annotation and label noise in the training data make it challenging to train or fine-tune such retrieval models. Although existing works have attempted to mitigate these problems by incorporating modified loss functions or data cleaning, these approaches either require some hyperparameters to tune during training or add substantial complexity to the training setup. In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise. Our initial results show that label weakening can improve the performance of the retrieval tasks in comparison to 10 different state-of-the-art loss functions."}

Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD.

Recent lightweight training approaches have shown promise by learning optimal timesteps, but their scope remains restricted to ODE discretizations. To broaden this scope, we propose learning the optimal transformation of the sampling trajectory by parameterizing stochastic interpolant (SI) schedulers. The main challenge lies in designing a parameterization that satisfies critical desiderata, including boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity of the SNR. To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as Bézier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties. This reduces the problem to learning an ordered set of points in the time range, while the interpretation of the points changes from ODE timesteps to Bézier control points. Across a range of pretrained diffusion and flow models, BézierFlow consistently outperforms prior timestep-learning methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of expanding the search space from discrete timesteps to Bézier-based trajectory transformations."}

Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD.

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8.

To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."}

Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions.

We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames.

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments."}

However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source."}

Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations. The experimental results show that this human-in-the-loop, multi-agent workflow not only improves the precision and consistency of multilingual legal terminology mapping but also offers greater scalability compared to traditional manual methods."}

Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads.

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."}

However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping.

Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information."}

We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios.

Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy."}

We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines.

DP-EMAR estimates corruption patterns and applies adaptive correction before privacy noise is added, enabling reliable in network repair without violating confidentiality. By integrating Differential Privacy (DP) with Secure Aggregation (SA), the framework distinguishes DP noise from genuine transmission errors. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT sensor and graph datasets show that DP-EMAR preserves convergence stability and maintains near baseline performance under communication corruption while ensuring strict (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantees. The framework enhances robustness, communication efficiency, and trust in privacy preserving Federated IoT learning."}

However, existing data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods-primarily designed for classification-often disregard this continuity, resulting in significant performance degradation when applied directly to segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data."}

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data.

This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA.

Second, legacy edge hardware lacks the resources to train and run large AI models. Finally, both anomalous and normal training data are often scarce, particularly for newly introduced product variations. We investigate on-device continual learning for unsupervised VAD with localization, extending the PatchCore to incorporate online learning for real-world industrial scenarios. The proposed method leverages a lightweight feature extractor and an incremental coreset update mechanism based on k-center selection, enabling rapid, memory-efficient adaptation from limited data while eliminating costly cloud retraining. Evaluations on an industrial use case are conducted using a testbed designed to emulate flexible production with frequent variant changes in a controlled environment.

Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception."}

While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\\% in KV-Retrieval tasks."}

We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process. The framework situates exogenous drift, adaptive data analysis, and performative prediction within a common geometric structure, with $C_T$ emerging as the intrinsic quantity measuring distributional motion across these settings."}

Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents).

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks."}

The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $τ$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target.

However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method. We then construct a finite abstraction from the learned model in the latent space and guarantee that the abstraction contains the true behaviors of the original system. We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system.

This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy.

We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance.

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical.

Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features.

The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.\n  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection."}

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

We experimentally demonstrate that the Coconut approach, a form of supervised fine-tuning for latent-space thinking, is highly sensitive to design choices and exhibits several inherent limitations. To address these issues, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques -- an underexplored direction in latent-space thinking -- including GRPO and design a novel Latent RL method for directly optimizing the latent thinking steps.

While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings.

To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention \"key\" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance."}

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents."}

Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow.

Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively.

Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs.

MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation."}

Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning."}

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets.

The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure.

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints."}

Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.\n  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring.

They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases.

The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly.

Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence."}

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

This approach requires only a source domain description, preserves the task model, and eliminates large-scale synthetic data generation. We demonstrate consistent improvements across segmentation, detection, and classification tasks under challenging environmental shifts in real-to-real domain generalization scenarios with unknown target distributions. Our analysis spans multiple generative and downstream models, including an ensemble variant for enhanced robustness. The method achieves substantial relative gains: 137% on BDD100K-Night, 68% on ImageNet-R, and 62% on DarkZurich."}

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications."}

It enables precise control over subject motion and has important applications in animation. However, current pose-guided video generation methods are limited to accepting only human poses as input, thus generalizing poorly to pose of other subjects. To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pose-Anything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization."}

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%.

However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting.

Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets.

In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes.

We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023.

This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical.

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment."}

LLM responses are sometimes called \"hallucinations\" since the output is not what is ex pected. Memorization strategies in LLMs are being studied in detail, with the goal of understanding how LLMs respond. We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions. The SCOTUS corpus is an ideal classification task to study for LLM memory accuracy because it presents significant challenges due to extensive sentence length, complex legal terminology, non-standard structure, and domain-specific vocabulary. Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279. We show that prompt-based models with memories, such as DeepSeek, can be more robust than previous BERT-based models on both tasks scoring about 2 points better than previous models not based on prompting."}

We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image. We propose a training- and reference-free framework that decomposes chains into perception versus reasoning steps and uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness, additionally verifying this approach through a human meta-evaluation. Building on this metric, we present a lightweight self-reflection procedure that detects and locally regenerates unfaithful perception steps without any training.

Pancakes introduces a new problem formulation that is not currently attainable by existing foundation models. In a series of experiments on seven held-out datasets, we demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations, that are semantically coherent across images."}

Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass.

We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets.

However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning.

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach.

To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts.

Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself.

However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

This design enables the use of pre trained convolutional neural network backbones such as ResNet50 and avoids the computational overhead of complex video transformer models. We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model. Positive pairs are defined as projections from videos sharing the same label while all other projections are treated as negatives. Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video. Rather than relying on data augmentation these frame level variations produce diverse positive samples with global context and reduce overfitting.

Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving."}

Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol."}

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines."}

The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces."}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity.

When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts.

This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model.

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."}

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion."}

Focusing on people counting in indoor environments using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, we systematically investigate a broad set of approaches, including amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting and threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning."}

However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS.

Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers.

In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates.

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements."}

To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning.

We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner).

This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals.

We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics.

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions.

This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations.

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components."}

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

This approach mitigates local drift with minimal additional computational cost and no extra communication overhead.\n  Our theoretical analysis supports FLFA's design by showing how it alleviates local drift and demonstrates robust convergence for both local and global models.

We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold. We reveal a distinct and consistent difference in the ID for natural and adversarial data, which forms the basis of our proposed detection method.

By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively.

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt.

Finally, both anomalous and normal training data are often scarce, particularly for newly introduced product variations. We investigate on-device continual learning for unsupervised VAD with localization, extending the PatchCore to incorporate online learning for real-world industrial scenarios. The proposed method leverages a lightweight feature extractor and an incremental coreset update mechanism based on k-center selection, enabling rapid, memory-efficient adaptation from limited data while eliminating costly cloud retraining. Evaluations on an industrial use case are conducted using a testbed designed to emulate flexible production with frequent variant changes in a controlled environment. Our method achieves a 12% AUROC improvement over the baseline, an 80% reduction in memory usage, and faster training compared to batch retraining.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester (Machine Learning for Hydrodynamic Stability, arXiv:2407.09572), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis."}

This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions.

We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity.

To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities."}

In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process."}
