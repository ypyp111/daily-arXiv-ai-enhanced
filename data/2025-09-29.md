Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外训练数据、奖励模型或人工标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升了高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成的准确性，且无需额外训练数据或复杂的人工标注过程。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

### [2] [Improving Autism Detection with Multimodal Behavioral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21352)
*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过多模态分析（面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为）改进了自闭症谱系障碍（ASC）的计算机辅助诊断方法，特别是通过引入新的统计描述符提升了凝视特征的分类准确率，最终达到74%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自闭症计算机辅助诊断方法存在凝视特征性能差和缺乏现实世界泛化能力的问题，需要开发更有效和可扩展的筛查工具。

Method: 使用包含168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集，进行多模态分析，并引入新的统计描述符来量化凝视角度变异性，采用晚期融合方法整合各模态特征。

Result: 凝视分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后整体分类准确率达到74%，验证了跨模态行为标记整合的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了基于视频的多模态分析方法在自闭症筛查中的潜力，为开发可扩展的筛查工具提供了支持。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高价值上下文来解决VLA模型在长序列推理时的KV内存增长问题，实现推理加速和内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人感知和控制中具有统一性优势，但其可扩展性受到注意力二次成本和长序列推理时KV内存无限增长的制约。现有方法通过扩展骨干架构改善泛化能力，但忽视了实时部署所需的关键推理效率。

Method: 提出轻量级、训练友好的机制，将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习到的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文，保留最近的细粒度细节，同时积极修剪过时、低相关性的内存，同时保持因果性。

Result: 理论上，KV-Efficient VLA可实现高达1.21倍的推理加速和36%的KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小。该方法可无缝集成到现有的自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: 该框架在不修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑的情况下，实现了可扩展的推理，解决了VLA模型在长序列推理时的效率和内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语定位的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中事实错误和位置错误，通过合成数据集和多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了其临床应用，需要开发有效的事实核查方法。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络来检测错误。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上表现出强大的发现真实性预测和定位准确性，与基于真实标签的验证达到0.997的一致性相关系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程的临床推理中具有实用价值，能够有效检测最先进报告生成器的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过融合视网膜眼底图像的细粒度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升了疾病分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键空间细节方面存在困难，如青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和视网膜色素变性等疾病的诊断需要更精细的图像特征。

Method: MDF-MLLM将U-Net编码器四层的跳跃特征集成到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，通过补丁投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制进行视觉特征融合。

Result: 在双类型疾病分类任务中，基线MLLM准确率为60%，而MDF-MLLM达到94%准确率，提升56%。召回率和F1分数分别提升67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM提供了一个可泛化、可解释和模块化的眼底图像分类框架，通过多尺度特征融合显著优于传统MLLM基线，有望在临床决策支持系统中实际部署。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，利用图像模态分离原始不安全提示的有害语义成分，通过LLM将不安全提示分解为伪安全提示和有害提示，绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，对基于图像输入的潜在漏洞探索不足，且文本方法难以绕过模型的安全过滤器。

Method: 1. LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示；2. LLM将有提示重写为自然对抗提示以绕过安全过滤器；3. 视觉语言模型生成图像描述，指导LLM迭代重写和优化生成内容。

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像内容。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了T2I模型在图像模态输入下的安全漏洞，为模型安全防护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测联合监督的方法，通过相互学习模块提升显著目标检测的完整性和边界准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前显著目标检测中由于物体内部复杂性和卷积池化操作步长导致的预测不完整和边界不准确问题。

Method: 使用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测三个任务的联合监督，开发相互学习模块(MLM)，通过多分支网络相互学习提升性能。

Result: 在七个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多任务联合监督和相互学习机制，能够有效提升显著目标检测的完整性和边界精度，在多个数据集上取得最优结果。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore是一个全新的多模态相关性评估指标，首次通过多模态联合表示来评估三个及以上模态的相关性，相比现有方法在一致性模态上提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标通常借用预训练对比学习模型的双模态嵌入能力，仅适用于两个模态的关联分析，这极大地限制了多模态相似性的评估。

Method: 通过多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到相同的潜在空间中，能够在同一尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平的相关性评分提供支持。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上比现有方法提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%。

Conclusion: MAJORScore作为更可靠的指标，适用于大规模多模态数据集的相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于云AI平台，通过点云数据分析脚手架结构变化，实现自动化监测以替代人工检查


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工目视检查，耗时且易出错，存在安全隐患

Method: 构建云AI平台处理点云数据，对比认证参考数据与最新点云数据来检测结构修改

Result: 系统能够检测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查时间和精力

Conclusion: AI和数字化技术可提高脚手架检查准确性，改善施工现场安全

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实尺寸的图像（如微小海象与巨大按钮），包含图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中反事实可控性的挑战，特别是生成违背常识模式的反事实尺寸图像，以支持创造性和探索性应用。

Method: 构建自动提示工程框架：图像评估器指导数据集构建，监督提示重写器生成修订提示，DPO训练的排序器选择最佳修订提示。扩展Grounded SAM改进图像评估器。

Result: 构建了首个反事实尺寸文本图像数据集，图像评估器性能比骨干网络提升114%。实验表明该方法优于最先进基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在反事实尺寸图像生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)在非荧光相位调制显微镜下实现超分辨率成像的能力，发现两种模型在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学显微镜横向分辨率限制(~200nm)的问题，避免使用昂贵的专用设备或荧光超分辨率技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率方案。

Method: 使用两种自研的深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)，在Zernike相位对比和微分干涉对比显微镜模式下，对原子力显微镜校准的纳米结构测试靶进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 两种网络在不同信噪比条件下表现互补：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构和源图像信噪比对超分辨率质量有重要影响，即使在相同训练数据和训练周期下，不同架构在不同条件下表现各异，需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的模型。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和Transformer机制实现视听融合导航，在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视听导航方法仅进行基础的多模态融合，忽视了更深层次的感知上下文信息，需要更有效的跨模态信息融合策略。

Method: 采用多目标架构配合精炼的Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上，DMTF-AVN在成功率(SR)、路径效率(SPL)和场景适应性(SNA)方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的高级多模态融合策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化的概念标注促进一对一的概念-神经元映射，显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘所需的超参数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然减少了神经元的多种语义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程进行概念遗忘。

Method: 引入监督式稀疏自编码器训练，通过系统概念标注缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，仅增加训练时的交叉熵计算开销。

Result: 在UnlearnCanvas基准测试中比现有技术提升9.22%，在9对象移除的序列遗忘任务中遗忘准确率提升28.4%，推理时超参数搜索减少96.67%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元，显著提高了概念遗忘的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在生物医学图像分类中需要大量计算资源和时间，特别是在超参数搜索时。随机采样选择训练子集存在代表性不足的问题，特别是在不平衡数据集中偏向主导类别，且无法捕捉类内多样性。

Method: 提出智能核心集选择机制，通过提取类内多样性形成每类聚类，然后基于这些聚类进行最终采样，确保子集能更好地代表原始数据集的特征。

Result: 在知名生物医学成像数据集上的分类实验表明，该方法在多个性能指标上优于随机采样方法，在相同条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 所提出的智能核心集选择方法能有效提高深度学习模型训练效率，同时保持模型性能，为处理大规模数据集提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，通过整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片来改进乳腺癌风险预测，在真实世界不平衡数据中表现优于单次检查模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的既往乳腺X光片，且缺乏对真实世界不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应能力。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式，使用大型基于人群的筛查数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多种不同既往检查数量和组成的场景中，LongiMam一致地改善了预测性能，结合当前和既往访问的表现优于单次访问模型。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来改进风险分层。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

TL;DR: 该论文研究CNN与人类大脑在社交认知任务中的对应关系，发现CNN难以超越简单视觉处理，不能反映高阶脑处理。作者提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同物体类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CNN与人类大脑在更复杂的社交认知任务（如图像情感评估）中的对应关系，而不仅仅是基础视觉感知。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估CNN架构与人类行为和fMRI数据的对齐程度，并开发Object2Brain框架结合GradCAM和物体检测来分析不同物体类别的影响。

Result: CNN在情感评估任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，不同CNN架构显示出不同的物体类别敏感性。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂社交认知任务中与人类高阶脑处理的对齐有限，需要进一步研究来理解这种对应关系的局限性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，用于解决概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)中的系统性偏差问题，通过移除和重训练两步流程来减少模型对不良概念的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CBM的概念干预无法解决模型从有偏数据中学习捷径等系统性偏差问题，需要更全面的调试方法。

Method: 采用两步流程：1)移除步骤-专家识别并移除不良概念；2)重训练步骤-CBDebug方法将概念级反馈转换为样本级辅助标签，应用监督偏差缓解和目标增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构(PIP-Net、Post-hoc CBM)和已知虚假相关基准上显著优于先前的重训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为CBM提供了一种有效的系统性偏差调试方法，通过可解释性实现了概念级反馈到样本级标签的转换。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是海洋历史的重要标记，但传统的手动检查测深数据方法耗时且需要专家分析，需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 开发基于深度学习的开源QGIS插件，使用来自大湖区和爱尔兰海岸的真实沉船数据以及合成数据训练模型，包括数据预处理、深度学习推理和阈值处理。

Result: 与基于深度学习的ArcGIS工具包和传统的逆沉洞检测方法相比，该工具在分割性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的自动化沉船检测解决方案，其开源特性便于社区使用和进一步开发。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝对神经网络可解释性的影响，发现适度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低概念语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明神经网络可以在保持性能的同时大幅剪枝，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients的事后解释，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT概念提取跟踪学习概念的语义一致性变化。

Result: 轻到中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留了清晰、语义有意义的概念；而激进剪枝合并了异质特征，降低了显著性图稀疏性和概念一致性，尽管保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以将内部表示塑造成更符合人类注意模式的形式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个从多视角图像输入进行联合布局估计和3D物体检测的方法，无需真实相机位姿或深度监督，在三个场景理解基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的局限性，因为大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，而纯视觉数据更为常见。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，使用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准上达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用有姿态图像，(iii)使用无姿态图像。在3D物体检测方面与专用方法相当，在布局估计方面显著推进。

Conclusion: TUN3D为整体室内场景理解设立了新基准，能够从多视角图像创建紧凑且语义丰富的空间表示。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能损害视觉关键内容的重建质量，需要解决语义通信系统中图像传输的效率和质量问题。

Method: 将图像分割为关键和非关键区域，关键区域使用图像导向语义编码器，非关键区域采用图像到文本建模压缩，并应用模型量化和低秩适应微调技术实现轻量级部署。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提系统在语义保真度和视觉质量方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在图像传输任务中表现出有效性，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升资源利用率。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Result: 实验证明该框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等实际任务中有效。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间提供了满足尺度空间特性的层次化形状简化方法，具有理论和实用价值。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率低(12.5km)，限制了地方决策的可用性，需要高分辨率气候预测支持地方决策。

Method: 在观测网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 在日平均温度上的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提升气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候信息。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Conclusion: 基于图像的越狱攻击存在实际挑战，需要为视觉语言模型开发有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Conclusion: 深度学习在自动植物识别方面取得了显著进展，性能已接近人类专家，但仍需考虑图像信息不完整带来的识别不确定性。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

### [29] [VideoJudge: Bootstrapping Enables Scalable Supervision of MLLM-as-a-Judge for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21451)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，在多个基准测试中超越了更大的模型，证明了视频输入对于视频理解任务评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本评估指标无法捕捉人类判断的细微差别，而人工评估成本高昂。大语言模型作为评估器的研究在视频理解领域相对较少。

Method: 通过生成器和评估器的交互训练：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个上，VideoJudge-7B超越了更大的MLLM基准模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B）。

Conclusion: 视频输入对于视频理解任务的评估至关重要，LLM评估器表现不如MLLM评估器，长链思维推理不能改善性能。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp，在保持精度的同时显著减少通信带宽需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来支持实际部署。

Method: 采用端到端方法，首先通过简单瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后使用多阶段残差向量量化，仅传输像素级代码索引来大幅减少数据量。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X数据集上实现273x到1365x的压缩比，在18 bpp时性能匹配或优于原始特征协同感知，在6-12 bpp时仍能保持优雅的性能下降。

Conclusion: ReVQom实现了高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为V2X实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业形象时存在的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，发现这些模型普遍存在严重的性别失衡和文化误读问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业形象时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，揭示算法偏见问题。

Method: 使用中性提示词生成1,006张图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估，第三方资深研究员仲裁分歧，共获得10,100个判断。

Result: 所有模型都显示严重性别失衡，DALL-E V3最为严重（96%男性），领导和技术角色中性别偏见最明显，普遍存在服装、场景和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中的人类社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别呈现有限，需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理增强的多模态大语言模型预训练范式，用于统一的不当内容检测，通过三个针对性预训练任务解决短视频内容与原始预训练数据之间的分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台快速发展，不当内容识别日益重要。现有方法通常为每种问题类型训练单独的小分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个针对性预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深问题定义理解）、Chain-of-Thought（增强推理能力），以解决分布差异和复杂问题定义。

Result: 实验结果显示该预训练方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，且对未见问题表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该推理增强的MLLM预训练范式有效解决了短视频不当内容检测中的分布差异和泛化问题，为统一检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过光标移动来定位UI元素，而不是直接预测坐标，解决了VLMs在高分辨率GUI图像中坐标预测不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的GUI定位方法将问题视为坐标预测任务，但现有的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率、复杂布局的GUI图像时，难以准确预测数字坐标。

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务：模型生成动作来移动光标，逐步接近目标UI元素。使用多步在线强化学习训练，带有基于轨迹的密集奖励函数。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的GUI-Cursor在ScreenSpot-v2上准确率从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，达到最先进水平。95%的实例在两步内解决问题，对困难案例能自适应增加步骤。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，光标提供的视觉反馈帮助模型更好地对齐屏幕位置，多步强化学习训练使模型能够高效地定位UI元素。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: 提出了X-CoT框架，使用LLM的思维链推理替代基于嵌入模型的相似性排序，提高文本-视频检索的可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个问题：低质量文本-视频数据对会影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似性无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性

Method: 在现有基准上添加视频标注以支持语义理解并减少数据偏差；设计检索思维链，包含成对比较步骤，产生详细推理和完整排序

Result: X-CoT在实证中提高了检索性能并产生详细推理依据，同时促进了模型行为和数据质量分析

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的检索方法解决了现有系统的局限性，为模型评估和数据检查提供了有效工具

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全性需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但人工检查容易出错，现有的基于自然/工业图像的自动检测方法在手术领域迁移效果不佳，存在误报、对小缺陷不敏感和领域偏移问题。

Method: 整合背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应技术，专门针对手术器械调整无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法克服了现有方法的局限性，能够在手术器械图像中可靠地检测细粒度缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过针对性的技术改进，成功解决了手术器械缺陷检测中的关键挑战，实现了可靠的细粒度缺陷检测。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表示对齐方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的替代方案来改善扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出LSEP正则化，通过促进中间层表示的线性可分性来直接融入线性探测到网络学习动态中，无需外部编码器。

Result: 在基于流的transformer架构(SiTs)上，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上实现了1.46的FID，显著提升了训练效率和生成质量。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了表示对齐，无需外部编码器，同时将线性探测直接整合到学习过程中，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，无法有效处理视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本的假阴性对，以及视觉相似但地理距离远的难负样本。

Method: 使用半变异函数将特征空间中的图像距离与地理距离关联，捕捉空间相关性。基于拟合的半变异函数定义预期视觉差异，识别难负样本和假阴性。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上的评估表明，显式建模空间先验能提升图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度级别。

Conclusion: 整合空间先验的对比学习策略能有效改善全局尺度的图像地理定位性能。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面存在困难，特别是在简单物理场景中。这是因为它们需要生成像素而非直接建模运动。

Method: 将运动预测任务构建为条件生成密集轨迹网格的问题，采用现代视频生成器的架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，从而直接捕捉场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 该方法在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直观物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性。相比先前的回归器和生成器，能产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地解决了从单张图像预测运动的问题，为运动预测任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

TL;DR: 比较DINOv3和V-JEPA2两种自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的表现，发现DINOv3在空间特征提取上表现更好，特别擅长姿态识别，而V-JEPA2的时序建模在所有动作类型中表现更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类准确率、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（轮廓分数0.31 vs 0.21）和姿态识别动作的区分能力（6.16倍分离比）上表现更优，但V-JEPA2在所有动作类型中表现更稳定（性能方差0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别但在运动依赖动作上表现下降，V-JEPA2的时序建模在各种动作类别中提供平衡的表示质量，选择应基于任务需求和可靠性约束。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing

Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

### [42] [A Data-driven Typology of Vision Models from Integrated Representational Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21628)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多种表征相似性度量的框架来分析不同视觉模型家族的表示特征，发现几何结构和单元调谐携带家族特异性特征，而线性可解码信息更广泛共享。通过相似性网络融合方法实现了更强的家族分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来理解它们的表示特征中哪些是共享的、哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表征相似性度量（几何、单元调谐、线性可解码性），并采用相似性网络融合方法整合这些互补的度量。

Result: 几何和调谐相关度量能强区分模型家族，而线性预测性度量区分较弱。融合方法显著增强了家族分离，发现监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，但所有自监督模型跨越架构边界聚集在一起。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发框架提供了视觉模型的系统分类学，表明新兴计算策略（由架构和训练目标共同塑造）定义了超越表面设计类别的表示结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过向冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，实现视频潜在空间和隐式3D场的联合建模，从而生成具有3D感知的一致视频表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。需要将视频想象与3D感知相结合。

Method: 引入交叉分支监督，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在空间和隐式3D场。

Result: 实验表明FantasyWorld有效桥接视频想象与3D感知，在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于现有几何一致基线。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一主干和交叉分支信息交换实现了3D感知视频生成，几何分支的潜在表示可作为下游3D任务的通用表示。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程。它能处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的异构时空数据，通过组件卷积、跨场注意力和轴向注意力等机制实现高效建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习面临处理异构、多模态科学观测数据的挑战，需要能够灵活处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的统一模型。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积处理标量和矢量通道，跨场注意力建模不同物理场间信息传播，轴向注意力降低计算负担。

Result: 在多种PDE数据集上预训练后，通过微调和LoRA适配器，在零样本和全样本泛化中均优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为学习异构多模态科学观测数据提供了灵活强大的基础架构，为可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习开辟了道路。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外成像在低光和恶劣天气条件下目标检测面临的类别不平衡、热噪声和计算约束等问题。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet主干网络降低计算量，并引入SlideLoss损失函数动态强调欠表示和被遮挡样本。

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2数据集上，MS-YOLO仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，达到竞争性mAP和更优的精确度，计算开销减少1.5%。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了保持高检测质量同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

TL;DR: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，通过显式预测跨帧物体运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based多目标跟踪框架在单一Transformer解码器层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致冲突和关联精度下降。

Method: 引入运动感知Transformer，显式预测物体跨帧运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞，实现更一致的训练。

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升9+分，达到71.3 SOTA；SportsMOT上72.2 HOTA；BDD100k上54.7 mTETA和41.6 mHOTA，均实现SOTA。

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是推进多目标跟踪的简单而高效的方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏置直接注入网络注意力分数中，解决了视频中的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，同时确保时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外拍摄的视频常受雨纹、模糊和噪声影响，且相机姿态的微小变化会加剧跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出DeLiVR方法，包含两个互补组件：旋转有界的李相对偏置预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；微分群位移计算相邻帧间的角度差来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的时空一致性提供了原则性表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏置实现了高效稳健的视频去雨。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到自然图像领域基础模型巨大成功的启发，希望将这种技术应用于SAR领域，利用基础模型的优势：只需少量标注数据即可适应下游任务、对分布偏移更鲁棒、特征可迁移性强。

Method: 首先测试现有最强视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR任务中的表现，然后使用SAR数据对公开SSL模型进行自监督微调，开发了AFRL-DINOv2模型。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型在SAR基础模型中达到了新的最先进水平，显著优于当前最佳SAR模型SARATR-X。实验分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应方法的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 自监督微调公开SSL模型是开发SAR基础模型的可行路径，虽然取得了积极成果，但SAR基础模型的开发仍有很长的路要走。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖笨重的物理设备或有限的静态截图分析，难以进行可扩展的UI测试和智能UI代理开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始手机屏幕图像和用户操作，首先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: UISim在生成真实和连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供了实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation

LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的群体情绪识别框架，通过多尺度场景编码和基于大语言模型的语义增强来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，同时忽略了情感标签语义信息对情绪完整理解的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（利用大语言模型生成情感词典，通过结构化情感树构建语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐整合视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的结合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的框架能够有效提升群体情绪识别性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型直接应用于医学图像分割面临边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足和缺乏不确定性量化等挑战，需要专门针对医学图像特点的改进方案。

Method: KG-SAM整合了三个关键组件：(1)医学知识图谱编码细粒度解剖关系，(2)基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测，(3)不确定性感知融合模块提升临床可靠性。

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验显示，KG-SAM在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部分割中MRI达到78.05%，CT达到79.68%。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个稳健且可推广的框架，能够显著推进医学图像分割技术的发展。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉模型需要跨模态和跨源的任务特定预训练，成本高且难以扩展到未见任务。受预训练视频生成模型已捕获时序依赖的启发，探索能否将其适应到多样化的图像和视频任务。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，将任务表示为视觉句子，其中上下文序列定义任务和期望输出模态。通过微调视频扩散变换器来处理各种视觉任务，无需任务特定修改。

Result: 尽管仅使用自然视频数据训练，UniVid在跨模态推理（图像和视频组合）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）上均表现出良好的泛化能力。理解和生成任务可通过简单反转视觉句子顺序轻松切换。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为视觉建模的可扩展统一基础，为多任务视觉系统提供更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，解决了现代ViT架构中token缩减与空间结构保持的矛盾，在多种视觉任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计（如窗口注意力、分解相对位置嵌入等），现有token缩减方法无法保持这些架构依赖的空间结构。

Method: 采用2D缩减策略强制结构化token布局、空间感知合并算法保持相对token位置、以及新颖的每维度最大幅度token表示来保留显著特征。

Result: 在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速且仅0.7% mIOU下降，在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速且无top-1准确率下降。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够保持空间完整性，与空间架构无缝兼容，在空间和非空间架构上都表现出色。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了GASP-ICL框架，一种无需训练的多模态深度伪造检测方法，通过引导式自适应评分和传播上下文学习来增强大型视觉语言模型在检测跨模态伪造内容方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中面临挑战，包括难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索，需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用MDD适配的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对构建候选集，设计图结构泰勒自适应评分器(GSTAS)来捕获跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号，生成区分性示例，从而精确选择语义对齐的任务相关演示。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL框架通过注入任务感知知识到大型视觉语言模型中，有效提升了多模态深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出ProDA框架，通过时空场景图和动态提示模块从多动作场景中分离指定动作，用于视频动作识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法提取统一特征处理视频中的所有动作，难以在多动作场景中建模不同对象间的交互，需要从复杂场景中分离指定动作

Method: 使用时空场景图(SSGs)和动态提示模块(DPM)引导图解析神经网络(GPNN)生成动作特定表示，设计具有动态权重的视频适配GPNN

Result: 在视频动作识别实验中，与最先进方法相比证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效从多动作场景中分离指定动作，提升动作识别性能

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多图像推理方面存在两个关键挑战：缺乏跨图像推理能力和跨图像参考奖励建模不足

Method: 两阶段训练范式：结合标注轨迹的监督微调和图像感知强化学习优化；创新性地提出了整合对象级和图像级标注信息的轨迹数据构建方法；设计了具有对象和图像双重奖励函数的图像感知RL策略

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，提出的数据构建方法和强化学习策略显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视频生成方法在长时程生成中的问题：扩散方法存在时间不一致性和视觉漂移，自回归方法则牺牲视觉细节。

Method: 采用动作引导的变长分块机制，将视频按机器人动作语义划分；引入上下文感知专家混合框架，为每个分块自适应激活专家模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在扩展推演中实现了稳定一致的长时程生成。

Conclusion: LongScape框架成功解决了长时程视频生成的稳定性问题，为具身操作数据生成提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成世界模型依赖像素级重建，存在视觉冗余问题；潜在世界模型虽然紧凑但忽略了精细细节。需要结合两者的优势来实现精确的动作规划。

Method: MoWM框架使用潜在模型的运动感知表示作为高层先验，指导从像素空间模型提取细粒度视觉特征，突出对动作解码有用的视觉细节。

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试中实现了最先进的任务成功率，并展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 混合世界模型框架有效结合了不同特征空间的优势，为具身规划研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DiTraj框架，一种针对DiT的无训练轨迹控制方法，通过前景-背景分离引导和STD-RoPE位置编码改进，实现高质量视频生成和精确轨迹控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专为U-Net设计，未能充分利用DiT的优越性能。

Method: 1) 前景-背景分离引导：使用LLM将用户提示分解为前景和背景提示；2) STD-RoPE：通过修改前景token的位置编码消除跨帧空间差异，增强轨迹控制；3) 3D感知轨迹控制：通过调节位置编码密度实现。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT提供了一种简单有效的无训练轨迹控制解决方案，显著提升了视频生成质量和控制精度。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在问答领域取得进展，但多跳推理（需要结合多个段落证据）仍然困难，需要改进检索策略。

Method: 在检索增强生成框架中比较余弦相似度、最大边际相关性和混合方法（结合稠密嵌入、词汇重叠和重排序），并采用EfficientRAG管道进行查询优化。

Result: 混合方法在HotpotQA数据集上表现最佳，相比余弦相似度在精确匹配和F1分数上分别有50%和47%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出HDR动态新视角合成（HDR DNVS）问题，并开发HDR-4DGS方法，通过动态色调映射模块在动态场景中实现高动态范围渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要针对静态场景，但现实世界常包含动态元素，如移动物体和变化光照，需要同时建模时间辐射变化和HDR/LDR转换。

Method: 基于高斯泼溅的HDR-4DGS架构，包含创新的动态色调映射模块，根据时间维度上辐射分布的变化动态调整色调映射函数。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度上均优于现有最先进方法，实现时间辐射一致性和空间准确的颜色转换。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从任意视角和时间点生成逼真的HDR渲染，解决了动态场景下的HDR新视角合成挑战。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Conclusion: SRHand能够从低分辨率图像重建出包含皱纹、指甲等细节的精细3D手部几何和纹理图像。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像生成技术的普及引发了对其滥用的担忧，但当前检测方法主要依赖过时的'真实'图像数据集，而现代智能手机拍摄的照片也经过神经网络处理，与生成图像在技术上有相似性。

Method: 通过分析当前图像检测研究现状，指出其依赖ImageNet等老旧数据集的问题，并基于现代智能手机图像处理技术（多传感器输入、神经网络处理）来论证'真实'图像概念需要重新定义。

Result: 发现当前'假'图像检测方法存在根本性缺陷，因为它们基于过时的'真实'图像概念，而现代摄影技术本身已采用与生成模型相似的神经网络架构。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义'真实'图像的技术概念，建立新的基准数据集，并质疑检测'假'图像这一目标本身是否合理。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Aes-R1使多模态大语言模型能够生成有依据的解释和可信的评分，在统一框架中增强了美学评分和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

Result: 实现了高质量3D背景中用户控制物体运动的和谐对齐，有效减轻了运动幻觉并确保视图一致的时间对齐。

Conclusion: Drag4D提供了一个统一的架构，成功实现了在高质量3D背景中用户控制物体运动的集成，展示了各阶段和最终结果的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

*Jibin Song,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导技术，生成与音频精确同步的380x640分辨率、24fps视频，在同步精度和视觉质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景的条件。但现有A2V模型由于间接条件机制或有限的时间建模能力，难以实现细粒度同步。

Method: 基于预训练视频骨干网络，引入两个关键组件：1) 运动感知损失，强调在高运动区域的学习；2) 音频同步引导，使用视觉对齐的无音频层离同步模型来引导完整模型，在推理时更好地利用音频线索同时保持视觉质量。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。提出的CycleSync度量显示模型能有效生成与音频同步的视频。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的运动感知损失和音频同步引导机制，成功实现了音频到视频的精确时序控制生成，为时序敏感的A2V任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LG-CD模型，利用自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，通过视觉基础模型和多层适配器提取多尺度特征，结合文本融合注意力模块和视觉语义融合解码器，显著提升遥感变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的方法主要关注单模态视觉信息，忽视了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息，限制了变化检测的性能。

Method: 使用SAM2视觉基础模型提取双时相遥感图像的多尺度金字塔特征，采用多层适配器进行下游任务微调，设计文本融合注意力模块对齐视觉和文本信息，通过视觉语义融合解码器深度整合视觉和语义信息生成变化检测掩码。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD三个数据集上的实验表明，LG-CD模型持续优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多模态信息为实现广义变化检测提供了新思路，证明了语言引导在提升变化检测性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的联合拖拽-文本图像编辑框架，结合了文本驱动和拖拽驱动方法的优势，实现精确的空间控制和纹理操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动方法缺乏精确空间控制，而拖拽驱动方法无法提供细粒度纹理指导，需要结合两者优势来解决互补局限性。

Method: 采用统一扩散框架，引入点云确定性拖拽增强潜在空间布局控制，以及拖拽-文本引导去噪在去噪过程中动态平衡两种条件的影响。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅能实现高保真联合编辑，还在单独文本或拖拽编辑任务中达到或超越专门方法的性能。

Conclusion: 建立了一个多功能且可推广的可控图像处理解决方案，支持灵活编辑模式（纯文本、纯拖拽或组合条件）。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用无标注数据，通过对比学习和侧载适配策略显著提升了北欧雪域环境下车辆检测的性能，为解决域偏移和可见性挑战提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法要么需要特定模型的反转设计，要么需要大量优化，难以利用最新的图像到视频模型将图像编辑能力迁移到视频领域。

Method: 提出向量场校正与样本偏差，在去噪过程中引入偏差项来融入源视频信息；使用结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知的时间相关噪声；采用偏差缓存机制减少计算开销。

Result: 评估显示该方法在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有方法，提供轻量级的即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: IF-V2V无需反转即可实现高质量视频编辑，为视觉创意提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

TL;DR: SSLCounter是一个基于自监督学习的多视角计数框架，通过神经体积渲染减少对大规模标注数据的依赖，在仅使用70%训练数据时仍能保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 使用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过可微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和视角相关的2D投影外观。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中达到最先进性能，仅使用70%训练数据时仍能保持竞争力，展示了优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter框架通过自监督学习有效解决了多视角计数对标注数据的依赖问题，具有很好的可扩展性和数据效率。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对基础模型的对象中心空间推理基准，评估了检测器和视觉语言模型在空间理解能力上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在空间理解方面存在不足，大多数基准测试关注定位精度而非对象间的空间关系和排列方式，这限制了场景理解的深度。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大规模视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 发现检测器（如GroundingDINO和OWLv2）能提供精确的边界框但关系推理能力有限，而视觉语言模型（如SmolVLM和GPT-4o）能提供粗略布局线索和流畅描述但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位能力与真正空间理解之间的差距，强调了社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一种无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中对单个上下文对的过度依赖问题，提高预测的稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)存在对单个上下文对的过度依赖问题，这会导致预测结果有偏见且不稳定。

Method: 提出基于补丁的k最近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏见，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上实验表明，PANICL相比强基线方法有持续改进，并对领域偏移表现出强鲁棒性，能很好地泛化到其他VICL模型。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且广泛适用的框架，能有效解决VICL中的过度依赖问题，提高模型性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一个轻量级的6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB图像作为参考，无需深度传感器或多视图图像，通过改进深度预测和深度感知匹配来处理透明、反光等挑战性表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法依赖深度传感器（对透明/反光表面失效）或RGB方案（在低光/无纹理场景中匹配性能差），需要解决这些实际限制。

Method: 1. 基于Depth-Anything v2提出token-scaler微调机制和优化损失，提升挑战性表面的深度预测精度；2. 引入深度感知匹配过程，在LoFTR中整合空间关系。

Result: 在REAL275深度预测上比Depth-Anything v2提升14.41%（δ1.05指标）；在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计平均召回率比SOTA方法提升6.1%。

Conclusion: SingRef6D在资源受限环境下仍保持鲁棒性，无需深度传感器或密集模板，能有效处理挑战性材料和光照条件。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Conclusion: DynaNav通过动态特征和层选择有效解决了视觉导航中的计算效率和可解释性问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across

TL;DR: 提出SemanticControl方法，解决ControlNet在视觉条件与文本提示不匹配时的性能下降问题，通过自适应抑制冲突区域并增强文本引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet依赖与生成目标精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实际应用中常遇到条件不匹配的情况，导致生成质量下降。

Method: 使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示进行辅助去噪过程，提取注意力掩码，然后在目标提示去噪过程中利用这些掩码来抑制冲突区域。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种视觉条件下（深度图、边缘图、人体骨架）都能提升松散对齐条件下的性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl能够有效利用语义相关但不完全对齐的视觉条件，提高文本到图像生成的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在视觉情感感知方面的评估方法存在不足，包括忽略合理回答、情感分类有限、忽视上下文因素和标注成本高等问题，导致评估结果不一致。

Method: 设计了情感陈述判断任务，并开发了一个自动化流水线来高效构建情感中心陈述，最小化人工标注工作量。

Result: 评估显示MLLM在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断方面表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面相对有限。与人类相比，即使是GPT4o等顶级MLLM也存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLM的情感智能发展提供了基础评估框架，揭示了未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

TL;DR: PartSAM是首个基于大规模3D数据训练的可提示部件分割模型，采用triplane-based双分支编码器架构，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有开放世界部件分割方法的局限性：间接从2D基础模型转移监督无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解、不可控分解和泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，triplane-based双分支编码器生成空间结构化token；引入模型在环标注流程，从在线资源整理超过500万个3D形状-部件对。

Result: 在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法；通过单一提示实现高精度部件识别；在Segment-Every-Part模式下自动分解形状为表面和内部结构。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型的决定性进展，结合可扩展架构和多样化3D数据实现了新兴的开放世界能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有无参考图像质量评估模型难以准确评估真实场景下的对比度失真，需要专门针对对比度质量评估的解决方案

Method: 定制化微调EfficientNet B0、ResNet18和MobileNetV2三种预训练架构，添加对比度感知回归头，使用孪生网络，在CID2013和CCID2014数据集上进行端到端训练

Result: 定制化EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014上达到PLCC=0.9286和SRCC=0.9178，在CID2013上达到PLCC=0.9581和SRCC=0.9369，超越传统方法和其它深度学习方法

Conclusion: 轻量级预训练网络的对比度感知适配能够为无参考对比度质量评估提供高性能、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实时和资源受限应用

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在数据稀缺场景下泛化能力差的问题，特别是在需要复杂对象-上下文推理的地理空间指代表达理解任务中。

Method: 提出推理中心的强化微调(RFT)范式，强制模型先生成显式的可解释推理链来分解指代表达，然后利用这些推理结果来定位目标对象。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1持续且显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过"先推理后行动"的方法有效利用有限标注数据，提升模型泛化能力和可解释性，为少样本地理空间理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床工作流程中应用日益广泛，但它们常常表现出奉承行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而非基于证据的推理。

Method: 构建医疗奉承数据集，使用心理学启发的压力模板进行对抗实验，提出VIPER缓解策略过滤非证据内容并生成基于证据的回答。

Result: 发现各种VLM普遍易受攻击，模仿和专家提供的修正是最有效的触发因素，模型存在独立于视觉证据的偏见机制。VIPER框架显著减少了奉承行为。

Conclusion: 该基准分析和缓解框架为医疗VLM在真实世界临床交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础，强调需要基于证据的防御机制。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一种利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理模糊的注视模式和口头问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户注意力被整合到视觉语言模型中以简化日常场景中的多模态查询。但利用注视数据建模用户注意力存在模糊性挑战：口头问题使用代词或跳过上下文变得模糊，人类注视模式嘈杂且与口头问题存在复杂时空关系。

Method: 首先分析数百个带有注视模态的查询样本，展示用户注视模式的嘈杂性；然后使用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成管道生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程处理嘈杂注视模式；最后设计热图模块将注视信息整合到前沿视觉语言模型中，同时保留其预训练知识。

Result: 在保留测试集上的实验表明，GLARIFY显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手的可用和直观交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型存在空间偏见问题，当关键视觉信息位于图像不同位置时会产生不一致输出。问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计，作者提出平衡位置分配机制来解决这一问题。


<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分理解。作者旨在系统研究LVLMs的空间偏见问题，特别是当相同视觉信息位于不同位置时模型的响应差异。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析模型行为，发现空间不一致问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出平衡位置分配机制，为所有图像标记分配相同的位置嵌入，促进视觉信息的平衡整合。

Result: 实验表明BaPA机制无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升在多种多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生了更平衡的注意力机制。

Conclusion: LVLMs存在显著的空间偏见问题，这源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。BaPA机制通过平衡位置分配有效缓解了这一问题，提高了模型的空间鲁棒性和整体视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Motivation: 扩散模型骨干网络既包含语义特征也包含视觉特征，但缺乏标注数据集使得分离视觉特征具有挑战性。需要一种方法来量化主题驱动图像生成中的视觉不一致性。

Method: 设计自动化流程构建具有标注语义和视觉对应关系的图像对，采用对比架构分离两种特征类型，利用解耦表示提出VSM指标。

Conclusion: 这是首个同时支持主题驱动生成中不一致性量化和定位的方法，为该任务的进展提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大。随着"图像思维"模型的出现，推理扩展到视觉领域，需要更高效的处理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段推理管道：第一阶段分析降采样图像识别任务相关区域；第二阶段仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理。使用强化学习框架开发奖励组件，实现推理驱动的感知。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率，同时效率更高。例如在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉token，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法有效解决了高分辨率图像处理的计算效率问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型DFF方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，特别是在精细纹理或深度突变区域，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 引入变分公式，包含空间约束和焦距约束：空间约束利用不同焦点水平的梯度模式变化来区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影；焦距约束强制单峰、单调的焦点概率，与物理焦点行为保持一致。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度精度和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DualFocu通过结合空间和焦距约束的归纳偏置，在挑战性区域提高了DFF的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: 基于信息论的实用率失真理论为多智能体协作感知提供了理论基础，RDcomm框架通过高效编码和消息选择实现了性能与通信量的最优权衡。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Motivation: 静态基准测试在比较文本到图像模型时诊断能力有限，难以全面发现系统性失败或隔离根本原因，需要主动探索范式来补充。

Method: 将错误发现构建为对最小化失败诱导概念的结构化搜索问题，采用新颖的加速技术处理计算爆炸问题，实现大规模失败景观的自主探索和映射。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas建立了一种新的诊断优先方法学，为深度模型审计提供原则性和可扩展的引擎，指导开发更稳健的生成式AI。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间作为负锚点，原图像作为正锚点，通过拉近忠实语义和推离幻觉方向来编辑解码器隐藏状态。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少了对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，同时保持召回率和描述丰富度，在LLaVA-v1.5-7B上实现超过5%的幻觉减少，且具有良好的跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，对无幻觉描述几乎没有副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法CoFFT，通过模拟人类视觉认知来增强视觉语言模型的推理能力，包含多样样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整三个阶段，在多个基准测试中实现了3.1-5.8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生过多与任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，这源于它们无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: CoFFT方法包含三个迭代阶段：(1)多样样本生成：生成多样推理样本来探索潜在推理路径；(2)双重前瞻解码：基于视觉焦点和推理进展严格评估样本；(3)视觉焦点调整：精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next等多个基准测试上，该方法实现了3.1-5.8%的持续性能提升，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知过程，有效增强了视觉语言模型的推理能力，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for

with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

Method: 构建了新的第一人称视角面对面教学视频数据集，提供程序步骤分割和对话状态分类的标注，并比较了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型有望实现对教学互动的整体理解，为教育支持和技能转移提供新的分析工具。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 使用Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) 和 Flow Matching (FM) 生成模型，结合专门的Separation U-Net架构，从噪声分布中合成分离的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在AVE和MUSIC数据集上的评估显示，DAVIS的两个变体在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架对于解决音频-视觉声源分离任务具有高效性，能够为不同声音类别产生高质量的分离结果。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中达到最先进准确率，特别是在跨数据集和未知操作场景下，同时保持实时可行性

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习方法对鲁棒和可泛化的深度伪造检测非常有效

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建模型无法生成资产的材质属性，这在多样化光照环境中对真实感渲染至关重要。需要一种能够生成PBR材质而非仅带不可控光照烘焙的RGB纹理的方法。

Method: 首先微调一个新的多视角材质扩散模型，以深度和法线图为条件输入。利用生成的多视角PBR图像，探索高斯材质表示，该表示与2D高斯泼溅对齐，并对PBR材质的每个通道进行建模。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了高质量的3D内容，包含PBR材质属性，支持动态重新光照，为实际渲染应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Conclusion: 提出的自监督点云补全方法通过多视角增强和Mamba架构有效克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了优异的补全效果。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在AFHQ数据集上，PCA集成显著减少了总优化时间，同时保持了良好的视觉质量，在较浅的潜在空间（W+层=3）中甚至提升了SSIM指标，并成功实现了AFHQ-Dog和AFHQ-Cat模型的图像对齐和可控操作。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性，证明了PCA与DragGAN框架结合的有效性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: Geo-CoT框架为地球观测提供了从模糊感知到结构化可验证推理的具体路径，公开发布的数据集和模型将推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

### [108] [Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225)
*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的开源框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义设计和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练、限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂多概念语义、跨视图语义不一致性破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成多粒度2D掩码并提升到3D，估计每个高斯点的前景概率形成初始对象组，通过语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，使用视觉语言模型从最具代表性的视角解释对象外观，提取鲁棒文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中优于已建立的基于训练的框架。

Conclusion: 通过消除昂贵的逐场景训练过程，MUSplat实现了更高效、更准确的3D语义理解，同时解决了单语义限制问题。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

*Jun He,Yi Lin,Zilong Huang,Jiacong Yin,Junyan Ye,Yuchuan Zhou,Weijia Li,Xiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球一半以上人口，需要从人类中心视角理解其结构和感知变化。现有基准在探索MLLMs在城市环境中的表现方面有限，缺乏对时间演化和主观感知的系统性探索。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时间单视角和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进的MLLMs，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅1.5%。多数模型在基于场景理解的任务上表现良好，一些模型在像素级变化检测上甚至超过人类标注者，但在需要时间推理的任务上表现下降。

Conclusion: MLLMs在城市环境理解方面具有潜力，特别是在场景感知和主观环境评估方面可以达到或超过人类水平，但在时间推理方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EXCL方法解决无源无监督域自适应问题，通过双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道，在无需源数据的情况下实现目标域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么只利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽视了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+预训练视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化管道（三阶段：协作检索、分别微调、学习目标一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法有效解决了无源无监督域自适应问题，通过双专家协作学习实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: FlashEdit是一个实时图像编辑框架，通过三个关键技术实现高速编辑：一步式反演编辑、背景保护和稀疏空间交叉注意力，速度比传统方法快150倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑方法虽然质量出色，但延迟过高，阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑框架。

Method: 1. 一步式反演编辑(OSIE)管道，避免昂贵的迭代过程；2. 背景保护(BG-Shield)技术，选择性修改编辑区域内的特征；3. 稀疏空间交叉注意力(SSCA)机制，抑制语义泄漏到背景。

Result: FlashEdit在保持优异背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，比传统多步方法快150倍以上。

Conclusion: FlashEdit实现了高保真度的实时图像编辑，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench基准测试，专门用于评估神经学领域的多模态临床推理能力，发现现有视觉语言模型在真实临床推理任务中表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试主要关注分类准确性，导致模型看似熟练但实际上缺乏高风险的诊断推理能力，需要更严格的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的紧凑型基准测试，包含鉴别诊断、病灶识别和原理生成三个核心任务家族，并采用结合LLM评分器、临床医生验证和语义相似度度量的混合评分流程。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等最先进VLM的系统评估显示，与传统数据集相比性能急剧下降，错误分析表明推理失败而非感知错误是主要问题。

Conclusion: 需要双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准测试（如Neural-MedBench）用于推理保真度，以评估临床可信AI。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMapGen是一个用于大规模地图构建的生成式框架，通过将车道线表示为离散序列，支持多模态输入，并采用状态更新策略，克服了卫星数据的局限性，实现了更完整、平滑的地图向量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和人工标注，效率低下。现有基于卫星的方法虽然提升了效率和覆盖范围，但存在卫星数据固有缺陷（如遮挡、过时）和感知方法向量化效率低的问题，导致道路不连续且粗糙。

Method: 1) 将车道线表示为离散序列，采用迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图向量；2) 提出支持多模态输入的灵活架构（BEV、PV、文本提示），动态选择输入模式；3) 开发状态更新策略确保大规模地图的全局连续性和一致性。

Result: 在OpenSatMap数据集上达到最先进性能，能够推断被遮挡的道路并预测数据集中缺失的道路标注。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过创新的生成式框架有效解决了传统地图构建方法的局限性，为大规模地图构建提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M：基于3D高斯溅射的统一框架，从多视角图像同时重建网格和分解材质，无需外部模型先验，能处理高反射表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反射表面，且依赖外部模型先验来增强分解效果。

Method: 联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失和优化过程。

Result: 重建结果与最先进方法相当，为下游任务提供三角形网格及其相关材质组件。

Conclusion: GS-2M框架能有效处理高反射表面，无需复杂神经组件，在广泛使用的数据集上验证了有效性。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MesaTask框架能够有效生成物理合理且与任务描述良好对齐的桌面场景，解决了高级任务指令与桌面场景之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Motivation: 尽管DeepSeek-R1已证明基于规则的强化学习在简单可验证奖励方面的成功，但在文档分析领域强化学习应用较少，而许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验，这是文档分析中最常研究的下游任务之一。

Result: 研究发现强化学习在分布外数据上具有更好的泛化能力，在三种不同场景下进行了验证：分布外图像、未见过的类别和不同模态。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档图像分类任务中表现出良好的泛化性能，特别是在处理分布外数据时效果显著。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频模型的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个看似无害的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，从而绕过安全机制生成有害视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到视频模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和文本到图像模型的越狱攻击漏洞，但文本到视频模型的安全性尚未得到充分研究，存在重大安全缺口。

Method: 提出SceneSplit方法：1）将有害叙述分解为多个单独无害的场景；2）利用场景组合约束生成空间，将输出限制在有害区域；3）通过迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器；4）使用策略库复用成功攻击模式提高效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上对T2V模型进行评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构攻击的影响，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合近期模型预测来提升扩散模型采样质量和效率，无需额外训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在使用较少神经函数评估次数或较低引导尺度时，输出仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均值之间的差异来引导采样过程，从而产生更真实、细节更丰富的输出。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在不同模型和架构下都能一致提升图像质量，使用预训练SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256无引导生成中仅用30步就达到了1.61的FID新记录。

Conclusion: HiGS作为一种即插即用的增强技术，能够实现更快速度、更高保真度的扩散采样。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决轻量级3D医学图像分割中存在的"效率/鲁棒性冲突"问题，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异质模态时，轻量方法往往表现出脆弱的表示能力。

Method: 采用可部署的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)；通过"扫视-聚焦"原则快速检索多尺度信息；引入模态交互和空间解耦知识迁移(SDKT)技术。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高了11倍，CPU吞吐量提高了48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的架构设计和知识迁移策略，成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率与鲁棒性平衡问题，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exemplar-based texture synthesis. We
introduce NIFTY, a hybrid framework that combines recent insights on diffusion
models trained with convolutional neural networks, and classical patch-based
texture optimization techniques. NIFTY is a non-parametric flow-matching model
built on non-local patch matching, which avoids the need for neural network
training while alleviating common shortcomings of patch-based methods, such as
poor initialization or visual artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to representative methods from
the literature. Code is available at https://github.com/PierrickCh/Nifty.git

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个零更新基础生成器的框架，通过三个轻量级策略头实现图像级别的扩散变换器加速，达到近3倍采样速度提升且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高成本微调，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用三个策略头（步长跳过、缓存重用、稀疏注意力）基于当前去噪状态独立决策，通过组相对策略优化在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗性判别器增强奖励信号。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等先进DiT骨干网络上，RAPID3实现了近3倍采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: RAPID3提供了一种无需更新基础生成器的图像自适应加速方案，在保持质量的同时显著提升扩散变换器的采样效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The
source code of this paper will be released on

TL;DR: CircuitSense是一个评估多模态大语言模型在电路图理解方面能力的基准测试，特别关注从视觉图表中提取数学模型的符号推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程设计需要从系统规范到组件实现的层次化抽象，每个层级都需要视觉理解与数学推理的结合。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 创建了包含8,006+个问题的综合基准，涵盖从组件级原理图到系统级框图的电路理解层次。开发了层次化合成生成流水线，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和带有自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器。评估了6个最先进的多模态大语言模型。

Result: 闭源模型在涉及组件识别和拓扑识别的感知任务上准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理方面的性能低于19%，揭示了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上始终获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: 数学理解在电路综合中具有基础性作用，符号推理是衡量工程能力的关键指标。当前模型在视觉到数学推理方面存在根本性局限。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO在保持实时性的同时，有效提升了无人机场景下小目标检测的准确性

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Motivation: 遮挡问题是当前视觉模型在复杂密集真实场景中稳健解释图像的主要挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 利用预训练GPT-4模型，通过设计特定提示词分析输入图像，生成遮挡顺序预测，解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多焦点图像融合方法在保持清晰焦点-散焦边界方面存在困难，容易导致模糊过渡和焦点细节丢失。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得具有完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的焦点度量进行边界细化。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量融合边界，有效检测和保留焦点信息，在多焦点图像融合任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

TL;DR: 提出了TDOA方法，通过聚类训练替代模型将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，使用最远标签目标攻击策略，在动态和静态输出场景中均取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出标签和变化标签空间的问题。

Method: 采用基于聚类的替代模型训练方法，将动态输出转换为静态单输出；提出最远标签目标攻击策略，选择偏离模型粗粒度标签最远的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害模型上验证，单查询最大攻击成功率50.81%；在静态场景中最大ASR达82.68%；在生成式设置中超越先前结果0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法能有效处理动态输出场景，对大型语言模型具有强大威胁潜力，同时在传统静态场景中也达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的医学图像语义分割系统仍有改进空间，通过将医学背景知识融入模型可以提升分割性能。

Method: 将逻辑张量网络（LTNs）与SwinUNETR结合，使用一阶逻辑规则编码医学知识，包括分割形状约束和不同分割区域间的关系。

Result: 在海马体脑MRI分割任务中，LTNs方法提升了基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在文本到图像生成方面取得快速进展，但现有为扩散模型设计的概念擦除技术无法适用于VAR模型，存在安全隐患。

Method: VARE框架利用辅助视觉标记降低微调强度；S-VARE方法结合过滤交叉熵损失精确识别和最小调整不安全视觉标记，并使用保持损失维持语义保真度。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现精准的概念擦除，同时保持生成质量，解决了朴素微调带来的语言漂移和多样性降低问题。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了自回归文本到图像生成中的安全空白，为VAR模型提供了有效的概念擦除解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像解剖理解对自动报告生成、术中导航和器官定位至关重要，但受限于专家标注数据的稀缺性。需要开发能够利用参考图像指导未标注目标图像理解的方法。

Method: 首先训练VLM通过参考图像和目标图像之间的相对空间推理来识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的精细分割能力相结合，实现像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于SAM2微调基线，提供更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索VLM在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的方法，其优异性能突显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器因从有限训练数据中学习到偏差而难以泛化到新的伪造类型，特别是频谱偏差导致检测器过度依赖特定频带

Method: 1) Fo-Mixup增强动态多样化训练样本的频率特征；2) 双重一致性正则化：局部一致性使用CAM，全局一致性使用vMF分布在超球嵌入空间

Result: FreqDebias显著增强了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的频率去偏框架有效缓解了频谱偏差，提高了深度伪造检测器的泛化性能

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用图像恢复中未知混合退化问题，避免现有方法导致的过平滑、幻觉或语义漂移，同时摆脱对图像描述的依赖。

Method: 引入轻量级双分支条件器注入退化输入和轻度恢复代理的信号，设计时间步和层自适应调制调度，通过SigLIP特征实现无描述语义对齐，并使用可扩展筛选流程获取结构丰富的监督数据。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何注入条件信息——而非增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现稳健且无需描述的通用图像恢复的关键因素。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

TL;DR: 提出MSEA和ARC方法，通过多尺度解释聚合和激活排名相关性来增强多模态大语言模型的可解释性，解决现有方法忽略模态内依赖性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽略了模态内依赖性。视觉模态中孤立图像块的归因缺乏空间上下文，文本模态中依赖前文标记会引入虚假激活，这些干扰降低了归因的保真度。

Method: 视觉分支：提出多尺度解释聚合(MSEA)，通过多尺度输入聚合归因来动态调整感受野；文本分支：提出激活排名相关性(ARC)，通过前k个预测排名的对齐来测量上下文标记的相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在先进MLLMs和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于现有可解释性方法，产生更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 通过利用模态内交互增强可解释性，提出的MSEA和ARC方法能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，提供更全面和连贯的解释。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

*Bohan Huang,Qianyun Bao,Haoyuan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了U-MAN架构，通过多尺度自适应KAN和渐进注意力引导特征融合模块，解决了医学图像分割中细节丢失和边界模糊的问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：(1)简单的跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距；(2)缺乏深层多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中难以保持细粒度细节和精确边界。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在三个公开数据集(BUSI、GLAS和CVC)上的实验表明，U-MAN优于最先进的方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保持精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过改进的注意力机制和多尺度特征处理，有效解决了医学图像分割中的细节保持和边界精度问题，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的分割提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，以解决RGB图像传输和序列长度爆炸的问题，实现了90倍加速的拟合和3-20倍的输入压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RGB视觉编码器在边缘设备到云端传输时的能耗问题，以及基于patch的tokenization导致序列长度爆炸、注意力预算和上下文限制的问题。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过轻量级splat感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，在冻结的RGB transformer骨干上适配对比语言图像预训练(CLIP)。

Result: 在DataComp子集上，GS编码器在零样本ImageNet-1K任务中表现良好，输入压缩比达到3-20倍，但准确率目前仍低于RGB编码器。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基底，识别了架构瓶颈，为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘云学习表示开辟了道路。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模式识别模型大多基于预处理数据，但这些预处理（如ISP图像处理、高比特ADC转换）可能并非自动化分析的最优选择，且在低带宽和能耗受限环境中效率低下。

Method: 提出γ-Quant方法，学习任务特定的非线性量化函数，应用于原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备的人体活动识别。

Result: 实验表明，使用可学习量化的4位原始数据在性能上可与12位原始数据相当。

Conclusion: 任务特定的非线性量化方法能够在保持性能的同时显著降低数据传输需求，适用于低带宽和能耗受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督训练框架SSVIF，用于分割导向的可见光-红外图像融合方法，无需分割标签即可学习高级语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据的问题，传统方法只关注融合图像质量，而应用导向方法需要分割或检测标签，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割和像素级融合分割之间的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，就能超越传统VIF方法，并与有监督的分割导向方法相媲美。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架SSVIF有效解决了应用导向VIF方法的数据标注问题，在无分割标签的情况下实现了与有监督方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据策展深度研究代理，通过多步推理协调三个核心能力：校准发现、可控合成和共识标注，有效解决大规模数据标注的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署鲁棒的视觉系统需要高质量领域特定数据集，但在海量未标注数据中平衡数据质量、多样性和成本是主要瓶颈。

Method: 使用大型多模态语言模型作为中央协调器，通过多步推理执行三个核心工具：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据；可控合成生成罕见场景的新数据；共识标注通过结合非极大值抑制和投票的共识机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每张图像产生14.2个候选提议，最终标注mAP达到37.1%；在Open Images数据集上发现了903个新的边界框类别；校准发现工具在1000万样本规模测试中，计算效率比替代方案高40倍。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为策展工业规模数据集提供了鲁棒基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能有效解决医学影像跨域适应问题，生成高质量标注数据改善分割效果

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是首个细粒度、时空感知的基准数据集，用于标注人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，包含4.3K个详细标注，训练的多模态语言模型在识别、定位和解释假线索方面优于GPT-5 34.7%。


<details>

Motivation: 视频生成模型快速发展，但人类能否检测生成视频中的深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要建立能评估人类感知假痕迹的基准。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注提供自然语言解释、边界框区域和精确时间戳，将标注整合为9大类深度伪造痕迹，训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型模仿人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在假线索识别、定位和解释方面平均优于GPT-5 34.7%，观察到一致的难度梯度：二元真假分类最容易，细粒度假痕迹检测较难，其中自然语言解释最容易，空间定位次之，时间标注最难。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信赖的视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PSTTS（渐进式时空令牌选择）模块，这是一个无需额外参数的即插即用模块，通过利用事件数据的时空分布特性来识别和丢弃冗余令牌，在保持准确性的同时显著提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件表示学习方法将事件流转换为事件帧序列，但忽略了事件帧序列的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致显著的计算开销。现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法依赖于不可靠的中间令牌表示且忽略了事件噪声的影响，无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：空间令牌净化通过评估每个事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域；时间令牌选择通过评估相邻事件帧之间的运动模式相似性来精确识别和移除冗余时间信息。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上对UniformerV2、VideoSwin、EVMamba和ExACT四个代表性骨干网络进行测试，PSTTS显著提高了效率。在DailyDVS-200数据集上，FLOPs减少了29-43.6%，FPS提高了21.6-41.3%，同时保持了任务准确性。

Conclusion: PSTTS能够有效利用事件数据的时空分布特性，在保持准确性的同时显著提高计算效率，为事件数据处理提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的图像描述模型依赖监督微调，需要昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型记忆特定答案而缺乏泛化性和创造性。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦流程：LVLM生成描述，然后用独立的无视觉LLM基于描述回答选择题，以其准确率作为强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升；在Prism评估框架中性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，平均超出基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL是首个将RLVR应用于主观图像描述任务的研究，证明通过基于效用的奖励设计可以显著提升描述质量，为图像描述提供新的训练范式。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

TL;DR: GCPO提出了一种针对AR视觉生成中关键令牌的优化方法，通过识别因果依赖、熵梯度结构和RLVR多样性三个维度的关键令牌，仅使用30%的图像令牌就能实现比全令牌优化更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有图像令牌进行统一优化，但不同令牌对训练的重要性不同。关键挑战在于如何在AR生成过程中识别更关键的图像令牌并实施有效的令牌级优化。

Method: GCPO从三个角度识别关键令牌：因果依赖（早期令牌决定后期令牌）、熵梯度结构（高熵梯度令牌对应图像结构）和RLVR令牌多样性（低视觉相似度令牌）。对关键令牌引入动态令牌级优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 仅使用30%的图像令牌，GCPO在多个文本到图像基准测试中实现了比全令牌GRPO更好的性能，适用于AR模型和统一多模态模型。

Conclusion: GCPO通过有效识别和优化关键令牌，为AR视觉生成提供了一种高效的策略优化方法，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级黑盒框架，用于解释多模态大语言模型中的自回归token生成，通过将生成的token归因于紧凑的感知区域，并量化语言先验和感知证据的相对影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度仍不清楚，这限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE引入了一个统一充分性（洞察分数）和必要性（必要分数）的目标函数，通过贪心搜索在稀疏化图像区域上进行优化，实现忠实且高效的归因。除了空间归因外，还进行模态感知分析，解耦token的依赖关系。

Conclusion: EAGLE在推进多模态大语言模型可解释性方面具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面的能力，发现模型在典型颜色上表现良好，但在非典型颜色集上性能显著下降，并揭示了不同模型在颜色命名策略上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度，也是交流物体和场景的主要方式。随着视觉语言模型的普及，了解它们是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本，在五个代表性模型上复制经典的颜色命名方法，进行跨语言分析（涵盖九种语言），并进行消融研究。

Result: 视觉语言模型在经典研究中的典型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非典型颜色集上性能显著下降。识别出21个在所有模型中一致出现的颜色术语，发现两种不同策略：受限模型主要使用基本术语，而扩展模型则采用系统的明度修饰词。跨语言分析显示训练数据严重偏向英语和中文，色调是颜色命名决策的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 语言模型架构显著影响颜色命名，独立于视觉处理能力。这表明需要更平衡的多语言训练数据和改进的颜色命名能力，以支持有效的人机交互。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EfficientDepth系统，结合transformer架构与轻量卷积解码器，通过双模态密度头和LPIPS损失函数实现高效的单目深度估计，在保持几何一致性和细节的同时显著降低计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有单目深度估计方法在3D重建和视图合成中存在的几何一致性不足、细节缺失、对反射表面等现实挑战鲁棒性差，以及边缘设备效率低的问题。

Method: 使用transformer架构与轻量卷积解码器，结合双模态密度头；采用合成图像、真实图像和伪标签图像的混合训练数据；实施多阶段优化策略；引入基于LPIPS的损失函数以增强细节。

Result: EfficientDepth在性能上达到或超越现有最先进模型，同时显著减少计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效平衡了深度估计的精度与效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

TL;DR: 提出HyCoVAD混合模型，结合自监督学习和大型语言模型，用于检测复杂视频异常，在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法难以理解复杂异常的语义含义，而大型语言模型虽然具备强大的上下文推理能力，但计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位能力

Method: 使用基于nnFormer的多任务自监督学习模块进行时间分析，识别可疑异常帧，然后通过LLM进行语义上下文验证，应用结构化规则推理确认异常

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量

Conclusion: HyCoVAD通过SSL-LLM混合方法有效解决了复杂视频异常检测问题，在保持高性能的同时降低了计算成本

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN是一个新颖的视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆来建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了传统方法中空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），导致空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀，阻碍高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出双隐式神经记忆框架。

Method: 扩展MLLM以融入空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力。构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆，仅保留初始和滑动窗口中的token KV，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 在广泛实验中，JanusVLN优于20多种最新方法，达到SOTA性能。与使用多种数据类型输入的方法相比，成功率提高10.5-35.5；与使用更多RGB训练数据的方法相比，成功率提高3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个针对脉冲神经网络(SNN)的半监督学习框架，利用SNN的时间动态特性进行多样化伪标签生成，在有限标签下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络因其生物合理性和能效优势受到关注，但与人工神经网络相比，SNN的半监督学习方法研究不足，需要开发专门针对SNN特性的SSL框架。

Method: 提出SpikeMatch框架，利用SNN泄漏因子的时间动态特性，在协同训练框架内进行多样化伪标签生成。通过单个SNN的多个预测一致性，从弱增强的无标签样本生成可靠伪标签，用于训练强增强样本。

Result: 实验表明，SpikeMatch在各种标准基准测试中优于现有适应到SNN骨干网络的SSL方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功利用SNN的时间动态特性，有效缓解确认偏差，在有限标签条件下捕获判别性特征，为SNN半监督学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成在效率和质量上的挑战，同时支持交互式功能如流式提示输入，使用户能够实时引导叙事内容。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制、流式长调优训练策略、短窗口注意力与帧级注意力汇聚技术。

Result: 在32 GPU天内将13亿参数的短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，在单张H100 GPU上实现20.7 FPS的推理速度，支持最长240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理仅带来轻微质量损失。

Conclusion: LongLive框架成功平衡了长视频生成的效率与质量，实现了实时交互式生成能力，在VBench基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个协同策略与奖励共同进化的框架，通过回收RLVR中的rollouts和正确性数据来同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，无需单独奖励模型和人类偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信号的问题，实现更高效的强化学习后训练。

Method: 在RLVR基础上，回收rollouts和正确性数据，使用点式奖励评分、成对比较和基于反思响应的评估等混合目标来训练模型自我评估和改进。

Result: SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，8个通用基准上提升1.5%，表现出鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARK创建了正向协同进化循环，无需外部奖励模型和相关成本，在多个LLM和LVLM模型上实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCNeXt的新型自监督卷积深度估计方法，在保持计算效率的同时超越了现有的CNN和ViT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但这些场景通常受计算能力限制。由于难以获取多样场景的可靠深度真值数据，自监督技术成为解决方案。

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中引入新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计了深度估计解码器。

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进真值和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链(CoT)提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中缺乏可解释性和可执行性。现有结构化CoT方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有标准化的顺序或条件规划语义。

Method: 使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练流水线：监督微调结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k新基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

Result: 在十个基准数据集上达到最先进或可比较的性能，特别在细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过正负引导的双图像提示能有效生成类判别特征，为小样本分类提供了高效的无训练解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型视角为VAR带来了持续的效率提升和生成质量改进，建立了AR变换器与扩散模型之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN方法通过利用LLM生成层次化文本描述符，增强CLIP模型的语义空间，解决CIL任务中的灾难性遗忘问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIL方法使用简单模板（如"a photo of a [CLASS]"）忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且CLIP仅使用最后一层特征，忽视了早期层的层次信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成区分性文本描述符，将这些描述符匹配到语义层次的不同级别，并根据任务需求自适应路由，实现精确区分同时减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise

Motivation: 现有指代分割方法需要微调或多模型组合，而大规模生成扩散模型包含丰富语义信息，可作为通用特征提取器

Method: 利用扩散变换器的注意力分数，识别并处理停用词作为注意力磁铁和全局注意力汇，提出注意力重分配策略，开发无需训练的RefAM框架

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的注意力特征可直接用于下游任务，通过处理停用词和注意力汇，能实现高效的零样本指代分割

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

### [160] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型架构，通过投影融合块和差分特征学习机制来检测大语言模型中的幻觉信号，发现幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，并揭示了层级漏斗模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是一个关键挑战，现有研究虽然发现特定隐藏层在幻觉内容和事实内容之间存在差异，但幻觉信号在层内的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 采用双模型架构，包含投影融合块用于自适应层间特征加权，以及差分特征学习机制，通过计算并行编码器学习相同输入互补表征的差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval的问答、对话和摘要数据集上的系统实验表明，幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，在问答和对话任务上实现了显著的准确率提升。分析揭示了层级漏斗模式，浅层特征多样性高，深层特征使用集中，仅使用1%的特征维度即可保持检测性能。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更加集中，这为开发计算高效的检测系统提供了途径，可以在保持准确性的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文影响力值(CI值)的RAG上下文选择方法，通过量化移除每个上下文对性能的影响来评估上下文质量，无需复杂超参数调优，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法由于检索到的上下文质量不佳（包含无关或噪声信息）而效果受限，传统基于预定义质量评估指标的方法未能充分利用可用信息进行全面的质量评估。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新概念化为推理时数据估值问题，引入上下文影响力值(CI值)度量，开发参数化代理模型进行CI值预测，采用分层架构捕获局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进基线，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于CI值的上下文选择方法通过全面整合查询感知相关性、列表感知独特性和生成器感知对齐，为RAG系统提供了有效的上下文质量评估和选择机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大语言模型宣传的最大上下文窗口在实际使用中的有效性，揭示宣传规格与实际性能之间的差距。

Method: 定义了最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定了测试方法评估不同大小和问题类型下的上下文窗口有效性，创建了标准化比较模型效能的方法。

Result: 收集了数十万个数据点，发现最大有效上下文窗口与宣传的最大上下文窗口存在显著差异，且随问题类型变化。大多数顶级模型在100个token内就会失败，在1000个token内准确率严重下降。

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口随问题类型变化，这为提高模型准确率和减少幻觉率提供了清晰可行的见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在多语言环境中的道德判断存在显著不一致性，反映了文化错位问题，需要更具文化意识的AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多语言和多文化环境中部署，需要评估其在多样化语言和文化背景下进行道德推理的能力，因为其主要基于英语数据训练可能影响跨文化泛化能力。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上不同的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，通过精心构建的研究问题分析差异驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLMs在不同语言中的道德判断存在显著不一致性，经常反映文化错位，并揭示了从分歧到推理策略的各种差异驱动因素。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个结构化的道德推理错误类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统，以解决LLMs在跨语言和文化环境中的道德判断不一致问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难。大型语言模型的发展为通过结构化、可解释和患者友好的输出增强决策支持提供了机会。

Method: 使用完全基于合成病例的模拟框架，这些病例符合ADA 2025护理标准并受公共数据集启发。测试了五个代表性场景：症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查、远程监测和多模态并发症检测。

Result: 结果显示GPT-5与ADA定义的标准高度一致，表明其可能作为临床医生和患者的双重用途工具。

Conclusion: GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中表现出色，同时强调了可重复评估框架在负责任评估医疗领域LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

Motivation: 道德对齐已成为调节预训练语言模型行为的广泛采用方法，但这一过程通常以降低下游任务性能为代价。先前研究通常旨在通过精心设计的公平目标来实现性能权衡，鼓励PLMs选择性地遗忘刻板印象知识，同时保持其有用性。

Method: 通过遗忘和公平目标的视角，研究在减轻性别刻板印象背景下的性能权衡机制。分析当前公平目标在实现权衡方面的局限性。

Result: 分析表明：(1) 下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；(2) 选择性遗忘刻板印象倾向于增加整体遗忘；(3) 减轻遗忘的一般解决方案在减少整体遗忘方面无效，且无法改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前公平目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘，而减轻遗忘的一般方法无法有效改善下游任务性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

Motivation: 开发能够整合企业特定知识的自定义推理模型来解决企业客户面临的问题，特别是在奖励函数可验证的RL设置下。

Method: 采用简单的通用训练方法：精心设计提示和模型选择，使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热训练，然后进行严格的在线RLVR训练。

Result: 在BIRD排行榜上首次提交就达到了私有测试集的最先进准确率：不使用自一致性时为73.56%，使用自一致性时为75.68%，且所需生成次数少于第二名方法。

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是一个代理任务，但该框架的简单性使其广泛适用于企业领域，如商业智能、数据科学和编码。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习可验证奖励框架中引入混合令牌生成方法，通过利用模型概率分布信息而非仅采样离散令牌，显著提升语言模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在推理过程中仅采样离散令牌，丢弃了模型概率分布中的丰富信息，不必要地限制了推理搜索空间。

Method: 提出混合令牌生成统一框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间，包括构建令牌嵌入加权和的训练无关方法。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法在10个任务中的7个上实现5-35%的显著提升，仅用一半轨迹数达到相当准确率。

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持隐藏状态熵和促进令牌空间探索来提升推理性能，证明了利用分布信息在强化学习推理中的价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在提升分类准确率的同时带来的推理吞吐量显著下降问题，平衡准确率与效率之间的权衡。

Method: 为仅解码器语言模型添加两个头部：(1)池化分类头用于训练和推理，(2)推理头仅在训练时受教师推理监督。使用标签交叉熵和输入加推理序列的token级语言模型损失的加权和进行训练。

Result: 在七个SuperGLUE任务上，相比池化基线获得0.65-5.47%的相对增益，在蕴含/因果任务上增益更大。推理吞吐量与池化分类器匹配，比相同骨干网络的CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法有效解决了CoT推理的吞吐量瓶颈，在保持高准确率的同时实现了高效的推理性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码的哪些方面（结构或语义）对提升大型语言模型的推理能力最为重要，为设计训练数据提供指导。

Method: 在10种编程语言上构建平行指令数据集，应用受控扰动来选择性破坏代码的结构或语义特性，然后在5个模型家族、8种规模的LLM上进行微调和评估。

Result: 在3,331个实验中，LLM对结构扰动比语义扰动更敏感；伪代码和流程图等抽象表示与真实代码效果相当；即使语义错误的代码，只要保持表面规律性，性能仍然有竞争力；不同编程语言对特定任务有不同优势。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性是提升LLM推理能力的关键因素，适当的抽象表示可以替代真实代码，这为设计更高效的训练数据提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Result: 临床语音存在一致的领域惩罚，该惩罚在不同模型中保持显著。错误分析显示主要问题为误报和漏检，与短轮次和频繁重叠相关。领域适应可减少错误但无法完全消除差距。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种LLM引用范式：生成时引用(G-Cite)和后处理引用(P-Cite)，发现在高风险应用中推荐采用检索为中心、P-Cite优先的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗、法律等，可信赖的LLM必须提供可验证的引用源，但实践中面临选择生成时引用还是后处理引用的困境。

Method: 通过综合评估从零样本到高级检索增强方法，在四个流行归因数据集上比较G-Cite和P-Cite两种范式。

Result: 结果显示引用覆盖率和正确性之间存在权衡，检索是归因质量的主要驱动因素。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率和竞争性正确性，G-Cite方法优先精度但牺牲覆盖率和速度。

Conclusion: 推荐高风险应用采用检索为中心、P-Cite优先的方法，而精度关键场景如严格声明验证则保留使用G-Cite。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

TL;DR: ComPSum是一个个性化多文档摘要框架，通过比较用户偏好与其他用户的偏好来生成结构化分析，从而指导个性化摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化多文档摘要需要满足用户对写作风格和内容焦点的个性化偏好，通过识别用户偏好的细粒度差异来实现有效个性化。

Method: ComPSum首先通过比较给定用户偏好与其他用户偏好来生成用户的结构化分析，然后使用该分析指导个性化摘要的生成。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估框架进行评估，ComPSum优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好来识别细粒度差异是有效个性化多文档摘要的关键，ComPSum框架在此方面表现出色。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，用于处理单样本、开放词汇和多模态的PDDL形式化，在真实、多视角、低质量图像规划任务中显著优于端到端规划生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长时程规划任务中表现不佳。文本领域已证明将LLMs作为形式化器优于直接生成动作序列，但在多模态环境中相关研究仍很稀缺。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，将多模态规划问题转换为PDDL形式化语言，然后调用正式求解器来推导可验证的计划。评估了单样本、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化能力。

Result: VLM作为形式化器在规划任务中显著优于端到端计划生成方法。研究发现瓶颈在于视觉而非语言能力，VLMs经常无法捕捉到必要的对象关系的完整集合。

Conclusion: 虽然生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）能部分补偿性能，但其增益不一致，为多模态规划形式化的未来研究留下了改进空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现尽管语法正确，但文化适应性仍需大幅改进，挑战了数据量决定翻译质量的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准过于强调语法准确性和词汇正确性，忽视了文化适应性和本地化质量这些实际应用中的关键因素。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电商营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种方言变体，由母语评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 领先模型能产生语法正确的翻译，但文化细微语言仍是明显短板，即使是高资源语言也经常误译比喻表达和文字游戏。

Conclusion: 文化适应性是多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，当前基准对此关注不足，需要更大规模研究来指导跨文化机器翻译工作流部署。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

of various MORL methods when applied to LLM optimization, identifying the need
for efficient and flexible approaches that accommodate personalization
functionality and inherent complexities in LLMs and RL. We propose a vision for
a MORL benchmarking framework that addresses the effects of different methods
on diverse objective relationships. As future research directions, we focus on
meta-policy MORL development that can improve efficiency and flexibility
through its bi-level learning paradigm, highlighting key research questions and
potential solutions for improving LLM performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间自适应来解决长上下文生成中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法使用静态离线学习子空间，在数据分布变化时性能不佳，无法适应动态上下文变化。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留首尾关键token作为锚点，对中间token使用Oja算法在线自适应低秩压缩，兼容FlashAttention。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持甚至提升零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的超长上下文基准测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个无需模型微调、即插即用的实用解决方案，有效实现内存高效的长上下文推理。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的黑盒特性在关键应用领域引发了可解释性担忧，而现有的可解释AI方法在应用于语言模型时面临诸多限制，需要针对不同架构特点进行专门研究。

Method: 根据transformer架构类型（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器-解码器）组织可解释AI技术，分析各种方法在不同架构中的适应性和局限性，并通过可信度和忠实性双重标准进行评估。

Result: 提供了针对不同语言模型架构的可解释方法分类框架，揭示了各类方法在特定架构下的优势和不足，为开发更有效的可解释技术奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 识别了开放研究挑战，并提出了未来发展方向，旨在推动开发更鲁棒、透明和可解释的语言模型可解释AI方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠的方法来检测低质量评审中的错误信息。

Method: 定义错误信息评审点，构建人工标注数据集，提出自动重构前提的引擎，使用8个先进LLM评估ReviewScore，并进行分歧分析。

Result: 验证了15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题是错误信息，LLM在ReviewScore评估上达到中等一致性，前提级事实性评估比弱点级评估一致性更高。

Conclusion: 自动化ReviewScore评估具有潜力，前提级事实性评估是更可靠的方法，有望提升同行评审质量。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Abstract: Risk categorization in 10-K risk disclosures matters for oversight and
investment, yet no public benchmark evaluates unsupervised topic models for
this task. We present GRAB, a finance-specific benchmark with 1.61M sentences
from 8,247 filings and span-grounded sentence labels produced without manual

21 types guide weak supervision, while evaluation is reported at the macro
level. GRAB unifies evaluation with fixed dataset splits and robust

Motivation: 现有的图RAG方法面临根本性权衡：手动构建知识图谱成本高昂难以扩展，而自动提取的图谱受限于底层LLM提取器的性能。传统方法构建静态图索引，无法适应实际查询需求。

Method: 提出MACER机制，构建Chunk-Triplets-Community异构图索引，采用演进查询和演进子图的双重演进机制。通过构造器、检索器、反射器和响应器四个智能体的多智能体系统，迭代进行证据检索、答案生成、充分性反思以及查询和子图的演进。

Result: 大量实验表明，ToG-3在深度和广度推理基准测试中均优于对比基线，消融研究证实了MACER框架各组件的有效性。

Conclusion: ToG-3通过双重演进的多智能体系统，能够在推理过程中自适应构建目标图索引，减轻静态一次性图构建的固有缺陷，即使使用轻量级LLM也能实现深度精确推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Result: 在32个不同角色上的实验表明，ProPerAssistant能够调整策略并稳步提高用户满意度。

Conclusion: 结合主动性和个性化具有良好前景，ProPerSim框架和ProPerAssistant系统为开发此类AI助手提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Speculative Biased Decoding方法，用于解决大语言模型在流式应用中的延迟问题，通过重用最近输出作为草稿并偏向草稿标记来加速推理，在同时翻译任务中实现1.7倍加速和80%闪烁减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在流式应用（如实时翻译）中面临挑战，需要持续更新输出以响应不断扩展的输入上下文，同时保持合理的计算成本以满足延迟要求。

Method: 提出自推测偏置解码方法，使用最近输出作为当前增长输入上下文的草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿标记以提高接受率，无需草稿计算，是模型无关的即插即用解决方案。

Result: 在同时文本到文本重翻译实验中，相比传统自回归重翻译实现了1.7倍加速，且通过display-only mask-k技术显著减少了80%的闪烁现象，质量没有损失。

Conclusion: 该方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了一种有效的加速解决方案，消除了草稿计算需求，在保持质量的同时显著提升了推理速度和用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

Conclusion: Audio CoT无需重新训练即可显著增强音频理解系统的鲁棒性，为开发更鲁棒的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

TL;DR: SynerGen是一个统一的生成式推荐模型，通过单一生成骨干网络同时处理个性化搜索和推荐任务，在检索和排序方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索-排序推荐系统存在校准问题和工程开销，而现有的生成式模型在统一个性化搜索和推荐时存在性能权衡。

Method: 使用基于行为序列训练的仅解码器Transformer，结合InfoNCE检索损失和混合点对-配对排序损失，并提出了时间感知旋转位置嵌入。

Result: 在广泛采用的推荐和搜索基准测试中，相比现有的生成式推荐器和联合搜索推荐基线，取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了单一生成基础模型在工业级统一信息访问中的可行性。

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文使用因果推断方法分析结构化输出对LLMs生成质量的影响，发现在48个场景中43个没有因果影响，挑战了先前研究的单向结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制不严和依赖粗糙指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，并在七个公共和一个自开发推理任务上进行因果推断分析。

Result: 粗糙指标报告结构化输出对GPT-4o生成有正、负或中性影响，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个没有因果影响，其余5个涉及由具体指令影响的多方面因果结构。

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响比先前研究认为的更复杂，因果推断方法提供了更精确的分析视角，大多数情况下结构化输出没有因果影响。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了CARB基准来评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出了Think-as-Locals方法通过RLVR来改进文化感知奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估，需要填补文化相关评估数据集的空白，以推进LLMs的全球对齐。

Method: 构建CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域，提出Think-as-Locals方法，通过强化学习从可验证奖励中激发生成式奖励模型的文化推理能力。

Result: 评估显示最先进奖励模型在文化意识建模方面存在不足，CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务呈正相关，Think-as-Locals能有效减轻虚假特征干扰。

Conclusion: CARB基准有效揭示了奖励模型文化意识缺陷，Think-as-Locals方法能显著提升文化感知奖励建模能力。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展动作空间的同步机器翻译方法，通过引入四种自适应动作（句子切分、删除、部分摘要和代词化）来改善实时翻译的质量和延迟表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略的READ/WRITE动作无法充分解决同步机器翻译在严格实时约束下的高质量翻译需求，需要扩展动作空间来支持实时重构、省略和简化。

Method: 在仅解码器的大型语言模型框架中实现四种自适应动作，通过动作感知提示构建训练参考，并开发延迟感知的TTS流水线来评估质量和延迟。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续改善语义指标（如COMET-KIWI）并实现更低的延迟（通过平均滞后衡量），DROP和SENTENCE_CUT组合在流畅性和延迟之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译的动作空间为弥合人机口译差距提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出CaMIB模型，通过因果多模态信息瓶颈解决传统多模态学习中因数据集偏差导致的OOD泛化问题，使用信息瓶颈过滤无关噪声，并解耦因果特征和捷径特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化性能下降。

Method: 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声；使用参数化掩码生成器将融合的多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示；引入工具变量约束确保因果特征全局一致性；采用后门调整通过随机重组因果和捷径特征来稳定因果估计。

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务上进行了广泛实验，包括OOD测试集，证明了CaMIB的有效性。

Conclusion: 理论和实证分析表明CaMIB具有可解释性和合理性，能够有效提升多模态学习的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

TL;DR: 提出了ResT方法，通过基于熵的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，解决工具使用任务中策略梯度方差大、训练效率低的问题，在BFCL和API-Bank基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在优化大语言模型的工具使用策略时，仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，没有考虑工具使用任务的特殊性，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低下。

Method: 建立了策略熵与工具使用任务训练稳定性之间的理论联系，提出ResT方法，通过熵感知的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，在训练过程中逐步增加推理token的权重。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中，ResT达到最先进结果，比先前方法提升高达8.76%。在4B基础LLM上微调后，ResT在单轮任务上超过GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮基础任务上超过1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT通过熵感知的token级策略梯度重塑，实现了从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑转变，稳定了多轮工具使用任务的收敛过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统面临开放文本生成中输出可靠性判断的挑战，因为生成质量是连续谱且存在多个有效响应

Method: 使用语义一致性——集成输出在含义层面的共识，作为无需训练的可信延迟信号，不依赖模型内部信息，适用于黑盒API

Result: 在500M到70B参数模型上的评估显示，语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟降低达60%

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型内部信息，跨黑盒API工作，对模型更新具有鲁棒性，为实际LLM部署提供了实用基准

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like

trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估多轮长形式问答的基准KnowMT-Bench，发现在多轮对话中LLMs的事实准确性和信息效率会下降，而检索增强生成(RAG)可以有效缓解这种退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准主要关注单轮对话，而多轮对话基准通常评估其他能力而非知识密集型的事实准确性，这限制了LLMs在知识密集型领域多轮问答能力的评估。

Method: 构建KnowMT-Bench基准，采用动态评估设置让模型基于逻辑递进的问题序列生成多轮对话历史，然后使用人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 实验表明多轮上下文会降低性能：由于自生成历史带来的上下文噪声，事实能力下降；随着对话长度增加，模型变得更冗长，信息效率下降。RAG可以有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强LLMs在真实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义，RAG是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了其表达能力，需要非线性扩展来提升微调效果。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级非线性变换，并引入Sinter正弦激活函数来添加结构化扰动。

Result: 在摘要和分类任务上的实验表明，LoRAN相比QLoRA有持续改进，Sinter激活函数优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中至关重要，LoRAN通过非线性扩展有效提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统即使提供了正确和充分的上下文仍然会产生幻觉，现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测token的演化来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了高AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比现有方法提升高达+13% AUROC。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持稳健，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注模型对同一输入产生不同正确性的响应，而忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示。本文认为这些提示并非无用，实际上可以为策略优化提供有意义的反馈。

Method: 提出RL-ZVP算法，直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，即使没有对比响应也能直接奖励正确性和惩罚错误，并通过调节标记级特征来保持信息丰富、细微的信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61个百分点，通过率提升7.77个百分点，同时始终优于过滤掉零方差提示的其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了在RLVR中从零方差提示学习的未开发潜力，证明了零方差提示在强化学习中的价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

Conclusion: QoNext框架成功将用户体验质量评估引入基础模型领域，解决了传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

TL;DR: EMoE训练框架解决MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数量导致性能下降的问题，通过训练专家在不同组合中协作，显著扩展了性能扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数量反而导致性能下降，这是因为专家之间缺乏学习到的协作能力。

Method: 提出Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，同时训练专家在不同组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，无需额外训练开销。

Result: EMoE将有效性能扩展范围扩展到训练时k值的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE框架成功解决了MoE模型在推理时扩展专家数量的性能瓶颈，实现了更灵活的推理计算预算适应能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

TL;DR: 本文针对土耳其语等黏着性语言的引文意图分类问题，提出了系统化方法并创建了首个土耳其语引文意图数据集。通过DSPy框架实现自动提示优化，结合堆叠泛化集成方法，达到了91.3%的最优准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黏着性语言（如土耳其语）中引文意图定性分析的挑战，为土耳其NLP社区和学术界提供基础数据集和分类框架。

Method: 1. 创建公开可用的土耳其语引文意图数据集；2. 使用DSPy框架构建可编程分类管道，自动优化提示；3. 采用堆叠泛化集成方法，以XGBoost作为元模型聚合多个优化模型的输出。

Result: 堆叠泛化集成方法实现了91.3%的最优准确率，显著优于标准上下文学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为土耳其NLP社区和更广泛的学术界提供了基础数据集和稳健的分类框架，为未来的定性引文研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过结构化评分标准组件识别来改进自动评分，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在自动评分任务中作为端到端评分器面临的挑战，包括低准确性、提示敏感性、有限可解释性和评分标准不对齐等问题，这些阻碍了LLM在评估实践中的应用。

Method: 提出AutoSCORE多智能体框架，包含两个智能体：评分标准组件提取智能体从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分智能体使用该表示分配最终分数，确保模型推理遵循类似人类的评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上评估，使用GPT-4o、LLaMA-3.1-8B和LLaMA-3.1-70B等模型，AutoSCORE相比单智能体基线持续提高了评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE），在复杂多维评分标准和小型LLM上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多智能体设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案，特别在复杂评分标准和小型模型上显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出SimulSense框架，模仿人类口译员在感知到新意群单元时触发翻译输出的读写决策机制，实现了更好的质量-延迟权衡和实时效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SimulST系统需要专门训练数据和依赖计算昂贵的LLM推理的问题，模仿人类口译员的决策过程

Method: 基于连续读取输入语音并在感知到新意群单元时触发写决策的框架，无需专门训练数据

Result: 相比两种最先进基线系统，实现了更优的质量-延迟权衡，决策速度提升高达9.6倍

Conclusion: SimulSense框架在保持翻译质量的同时显著提升了实时效率，为SimulST系统提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了思维链提示在临床文本理解中的效果，发现86.3%的LLM在CoT设置下性能下降，揭示了临床领域CoT增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性的悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床领域对准确性和透明推理有严格要求，但思维链提示在临床文本（特别是电子健康记录）中的有效性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 在87个真实世界临床文本任务上评估95个先进LLM，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型，通过细粒度分析推理长度、医学概念对齐和错误模式。

Result: 与其它领域相反，86.3%的模型在CoT设置下性能下降；能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CoT在临床文本任务中增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性，为LLM的临床推理策略提供了实证基础，强调了透明可信方法的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

*Kasidit Sermsri,Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ThaiFACTUAL框架，一个轻量级、模型无关的校准方法，用于缓解泰语政治立场检测中的偏见问题，无需微调即可改善LLMs在低资源复杂文化环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在泰语政治立场检测中的系统性偏见问题，包括情感泄漏和实体偏好，这些偏见影响了模型的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督方法，分离情感与立场，减少偏见；并发布了首个高质量的泰语政治立场数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了伪相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并提高了多个LLMs的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏见技术的重要性。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

TL;DR: 提出MotivGraph-SoIQ框架，结合动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话来增强LLM的学术构思能力，解决基础不足和确认偏误问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术构思方面潜力巨大，但面临构思基础不足和确认偏误的关键挑战，需要改进以支持进一步优化

Method: 集成动机知识图谱和Q驱动的苏格拉底构思器，动机知识图谱结构化存储问题、挑战和解决方案三类节点，构思器采用双代理系统进行苏格拉底式提问

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在LLM评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供基础构思和实际改进步骤，显著提升了LLM构思的新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性表达的简单黑盒幻觉检测指标，通过分析LLM在不确定性表达下的行为，发现事实性回答具有一致性，而非事实性回答则不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLM内部状态，但在LLM外部API受限和外部资源有限的情况下，迫切需要建立有效的黑盒幻觉检测方法。

Method: 通过研究LLM在不确定性表达下的行为，提出基于一致性检测的黑盒幻觉检测指标，无需访问模型内部状态。

Result: 实验表明，该指标在预测模型回答的事实性方面优于使用LLM内部知识的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒幻觉检测方法简单有效，能够在不依赖模型内部信息的情况下准确检测LLM生成的幻觉内容。

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法存在两个核心限制：浅层检索无法获取所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据利用效率低下，这阻碍了从复杂查询中进行有效推理。

Method: GraphSearch采用代理深度搜索工作流，包含六个模块的模块化框架支持多轮交互和迭代推理，并采用双通道检索策略，在基于块文本数据上执行语义查询，在结构图数据上执行关系查询。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试上的实验结果表明，GraphSearch相比传统策略持续提高了答案准确性和生成质量。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向，通过全面利用文本和图数据的互补优势来增强事实推理能力。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模通常将离群点视为噪声而忽略，但本研究认为这些离群点可能包含新兴主题的早期信号，特别是在动态新闻语料中。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集（关注企业社会责任和气候变化）中跟踪离群点的时间演化。

Result: 发现一致模式：离群点倾向于随时间演变成连贯的主题，这一现象在两种模型和语言中都得到验证。

Conclusion: 离群点不应被简单地视为噪声，而是新兴主题的潜在指示器，对动态文本分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative
clustering approach, we track their evolution over time in French and English
news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent
topics over time across both models and languages.

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理具有歧义、多义性或不确定性的文本时仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 引入模糊推理链（FRC）框架，整合LLM语义先验与连续模糊隶属度，创建概率推理和模糊隶属推理之间的显式交互。

Result: 在情感分析任务上验证，理论和实证结果均表明FRC能确保稳定推理并促进不同模型规模间的知识迁移。

Conclusion: FRC为管理微妙和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要描述静态AIGT检测，而社交媒体内容受用户参与驱动并随时间演变，需要研究AIGT的时间动态和用户互动模式。

Method: 从小红书平台收集5年纵向数据，包含用户参与度指标和时间戳；提出PLAD框架，利用心理语言学特征进行可解释的AIGT检测。

Result: PLAD实现了优越的检测性能，揭示了区分人类和AI生成内容的特征，并发现了这些语言特征与社交媒体参与度之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD框架为社交媒体AIGT分析提供了重要工具，有助于理解AIGT的时间动态和用户互动模式。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET评估质量标准分类法，旨在解决NLP评估中质量标准名称不一致导致评估结果不可比的问题，通过创建标准化的质量准则名称和定义体系来促进科学进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域存在数百种不同的质量评估标准名称，即使名称相同也可能评估不同方面，导致独立评估结果无法可靠比较，阻碍了该领域的科学进展。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从NLP评估报告中提取质量准则名称和定义，构建层次化分类法，将现有数百种质量准则映射到标准化的父节点和子节点结构中。

Result: 开发了QCET分类法及其相关资源，能够建立现有评估的可比性、指导新评估设计，并评估监管合规性。

Conclusion: QCET为解决NLP评估可比性问题提供了系统化解决方案，通过标准化质量准则定义和层次结构，有望促进该领域的科学发展和可靠结论的得出。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)

*Wanli Yang,Fei Sun,Rui Tang,Hongyu Zang,Du Su,Qi Cao,Jingang Wang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了传统认为微调不适合模型编辑的观点，指出失败原因在于采用了深度优先的编辑流程，而恢复为标准广度优先的微调流程能显著提升编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为微调不适合模型编辑，但作者认为这种失败源于采用了不合适的深度优先编辑流程，而非微调本身的问题。

Method: 提出LocFT-BF方法，将微调恢复为标准广度优先（基于epoch）的流程，并采用小批量优化，同时通过系统分析调优位置实现局部化编辑。

Result: 在多种LLM和数据集上的实验表明，LocFT-BF大幅超越现有最优方法，首次实现10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的持续编辑，且不牺牲通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过澄清长期误解并引入原则性局部调优策略，将微调从被低估的基准方法提升为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知优化实现更好的模型保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略。

Method: 采用结构化稀疏因子分解，将权重矩阵表示为稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵，利用校准数据集优化因子分解以最小化功能重建误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在准确性和困惑度方面均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的有力替代方案，可实现高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过结构化对话行为表示来生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译带来的问题，提高对话的文化相关性和自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法通常依赖英语对话的翻译，这会引入人为痕迹，降低对话的自然性和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过抽象意图表示来编码、本地化和生成多语言对话，而不是直接翻译对话语句。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面均优于机器翻译和人工翻译的对话。

Conclusion: DAS框架能够有效生成更自然、文化适宜的多语言对话，为多语言对话系统提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

TL;DR: 本文提出Solve-to-Judge (S2J)方法来解决生成奖励模型中存在的solve-to-judge差距问题，通过同时利用模型的求解和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现生成奖励模型存在显著的solve-to-judge差距，即模型能够解决某些问题但无法做出正确判断（14%-37%），这限制了模型的判断能力。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM输出上同时利用求解和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中显式连接问题求解和评估能力。

Result: S2J有效减少了16.2%的solve-to-judge差距，将模型判断性能提升了5.8%，在使用更小训练数据集的情况下实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: S2J方法通过自演化方式成功缩小了生成奖励模型中的solve-to-judge差距，无需依赖更强大的外部模型进行蒸馏，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展(TTS)的方法来验证复杂数值声明，通过训练验证器模型从多个推理路径中选择最佳路径，并引入自适应机制提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在验证需要组合推理和数值推理的真实世界数值声明时存在不足，无法理解数值细微差别且易出现推理漂移问题。

Method: 使用测试时计算扩展(TTS)从LLM中引出多个推理路径，训练验证器模型(VERIFIERFC)选择正确推理路径，并引入自适应机制选择性执行TTS。

Result: TTS显著缓解了推理漂移问题，自适应TTS比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，比单次验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型能有效提升复杂数值声明验证的性能和效率，为事实核查任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-LAP框架，通过整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势来解决法律条文预测任务中的挑战，在多个司法管辖区数据集上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律条文预测方法面临显著挑战：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测场景中表现不佳，且大多数方法缺乏跨司法管辖区的通用性。

Method: 提出Uni-LAP通用框架，通过紧密协作整合SCM和LLM的优势：SCM使用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，LLM采用三段论推理来优化最终预测。

Result: 在多个司法管辖区数据集上的实证结果表明，Uni-LAP方法持续优于现有基线方法，展示了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP框架成功解决了法律条文预测中的关键挑战，通过整合不同模型的优势实现了更好的性能和跨司法管辖区的通用性。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: 系统回顾了31个模型和21个基准测试，涵盖编码器架构和生成式架构，分析训练方法和评估方法。

Result: 发现当前训练方法通过对比学习偏向语言中立性，而文化意识依赖于多样化数据；三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法，存在跨语言能力差异和训练目标与评估目标之间的差距。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言模型在语言中立性和文化意识之间存在张力，需要更好的平衡和更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型和定制领域特定模型无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域的模型来提高语义理解能力。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到FoodOn、SNOMED-CT和Hansard分类法等本体，并对模型进行微调。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本LLM提示基线相比表现更优，F1分数在某些本体和数据集上达到98%。

Conclusion: 该研究的主要贡献包括发布适合LLM微调/评估的食品标注语料库、发布用于推进食品领域文本语义理解的鲁棒模型，以及为未来基准测试提供食品NEL的强基线。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought提示方法存在的延迟高、内存占用大以及早期错误传播问题，寻求在潜在推理效率和显式推理透明度之间的平衡。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原则，将高层次推理计划压缩为少量学习到的潜在token（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量级或显式，使用任务损失和计划重建损失的双重目标。

Result: 在复杂基准测试中保持或提高了准确性，同时显著减少了推理过程中的可见token占用。

Conclusion: R-Capsule框架成功地在效率、准确性和可解释性之间取得了平衡，为大型语言模型的复杂推理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTO通过对齐训练与解码时的树策略来解决推测解码中的策略偏差问题，使用Draft Tree Reward和Group-based Draft Policy Training方法，在多个任务和模型上显著提升了接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练目标仅优化单一贪婪路径，而解码时采用树策略验证多个分支，这种策略偏差限制了推测解码的加速效果。

Method: 提出Group Tree Optimization (GTO)，包含：(i) Draft Tree Reward - 采样自由的目标函数，衡量在目标模型下草稿树的期望接受长度；(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training - 通过对比当前和参考草稿模型的树，形成去偏的组标准化优势，并沿最长接受序列应用PPO风格代理进行稳健更新。

Result: 在对话(MT-Bench)、代码(HumanEval)和数学(GSM8K)任务上，以及多个LLM模型(如LLaMA-3.1-8B、LLaMA-3.3-70B等)，GTO将接受长度提高了7.4%，相比之前最先进的EAGLE-3实现了额外7.7%的加速。

Conclusion: 通过弥合草稿策略偏差，GTO为高效LLM推理提供了一个实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但会产生冗长输出导致推理延迟显著增加。

Method: 采用多轮自适应CoT压缩策略，利用token弹性现象（过小token预算反而增加输出长度）进行渐进式压缩，为每个输入确定最优压缩深度。

Result: 平均准确率提升5.6%，CoT长度平均减少47个token，显著降低延迟；测试时性能可通过可解释特征（困惑度和压缩率）可靠预测。

Conclusion: CoT压缩既有效又可预测，支持高效模型选择和预测，无需重复微调。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了一种实用且高效的替代方案，具有较低推理成本、对长上下文不稳定性的鲁棒性，以及可逆编码支持安全和隐私保护。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 通过合成数据蒸馏框架比较指令微调(IFT)和推理模型，发现推理能力能显著提升模型性能，在大模型规模下尤其有效，在推理密集型任务中能超越IFT的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理能力强的LLM在各种任务上取得最优表现，但推理能力在哪些任务和模型规模下有效，以及其训练和推理成本仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用合成数据蒸馏框架进行大规模监督研究，比较不同规模的指令微调模型和推理模型，在数学中心和通用任务上评估多项选择和开放式格式。

Result: 推理能力持续提升模型性能，通常能匹配或超越显著更大的IFT系统。IFT在训练和推理成本上保持帕累托最优，但推理模型随着模型规模扩大变得更有价值。

Conclusion: 推理模型能克服IFT在推理密集型和开放式任务中的性能限制，在大规模模型下展现出越来越大的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

*Anandi Hattiangadi,Anders J. Schoubye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文论证大型语言模型（LLM）的输出是无意义的，因为LLM缺乏必要的意图来赋予其输出字面意义，尽管这些输出在表面上看似有意义且能被用于获取真信念和知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM输出是否具有真正的语义含义，挑战当前对LLM语义能力的普遍认知。

Method: 基于两个关键前提进行论证：(a) 某些意图是LLM输出具有字面意义所必需的；(b) LLM不可能拥有这类意图。并反驳了语义外在主义和语义内在主义的可能回应。

Result: 论证表明LLM输出本质上无意义，因为它们缺乏必要的意图基础。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM输出在表面上看似有意义且能被有效利用，但由于缺乏必要的意图，它们实际上是无意义的。

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RTP框架，利用LLM构建二进制树，通过自然语言问题对文本进行语义分区，创建可解释的文本分类法，比传统主题模型更易理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳，且生成的基于关键词的聚类需要大量人工解释，缺乏语义连贯性。

Method: 使用递归主题分区(RTP)框架，通过LLM交互式构建二进制树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，语义上分区数据。

Result: RTP的问题驱动层次结构比BERTopic等基线的基于关键词主题更易解释，且在数据主题与任务标签相关时，这些聚类可作为下游分类任务的强大特征。

Conclusion: RTP为数据探索引入新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，其主题路径可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库特定特征的一致模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了StableToken，一种通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定性的语音分词器，显著提升了在噪声条件下的token稳定性，并改善了下游SpeechLLMs的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义语音分词器对与语义无关的声学扰动非常脆弱，即使在高信噪比条件下，其输出token序列也会发生剧烈变化，增加了下游LLMs的学习负担。

Method: 采用多分支并行处理音频，通过位级投票机制合并各分支表示，形成单一稳定的token序列。

Result: StableToken在token稳定性方面达到新的最先进水平，显著降低了各种噪声条件下的单元编辑距离(UED)。

Conclusion: 基础稳定性直接转化为下游优势，显著提高了SpeechLLMs在各种任务上的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM依赖单一推理范式，难以处理需要多种认知策略的复杂问题，需要更灵活多样的推理能力。

Method: 开发Composite Reasoning方法，使LLM能够动态探索和组合多种推理风格，根据问题领域自适应地调整推理策略。

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，CR方法超越了Chain-of-Thought和DeepSeek-R1等基线方法，展现出更好的样本效率和适当的token使用。

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，LLM能够获得更鲁棒、自适应和高效的问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反向投机解码（RSD）方法解决大模型向小模型迁移推理能力时的分布不匹配问题，通过学生模型基于自身概率分布过滤教师生成的低概率token，实现有效的推理能力迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调方法在将大语言模型的推理能力迁移到小模型时往往失败，因为教师模型的推理轨迹包含学生模型分布中低概率的token，超出了小架构的内部表示能力。

Method: 提出反向投机解码（RSD）：教师模型生成候选token，但由学生模型基于自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉低概率token，生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上的实验显示，直接蒸馏使推理基准性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练则提升4.9%。低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: RSD能有效解决推理能力迁移中的分布不匹配问题，但RSD轨迹具有模型特异性，分布对齐需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试与氛围编程范式不匹配，要么需要代码级规范，要么只关注问题解决，忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，特点包括：纯自然语言提示、严格的数据收集流程、全面的测试用例（F2P和P2P测试）、多样化的应用领域。

Result: 评估了两个最先进的代理框架和四个领先的LLM，发现氛围编程范式下的功能实现具有显著挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%。分析还揭示了"激进实现"策略的倾向。

Conclusion: FeatBench为社区研究提供了新的评估工具，揭示了氛围编程中功能实现的挑战性和独特现象。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Motivation: 全双工语音到语音LLM是人机自然交互的基础，但目前缺乏有效的基准测试和建模方法，特别是在紧急中断场景下的评估。

Method: 通过六个多样化的人机交互场景，系统评估实时对话的延迟、质量和对话效果，并引入模型中断机制。

Result: 发现开源模型与商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 下一对令牌预测是实现真正无缝、类人全双工交互的有前景路径。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法依赖临时分类法，缺乏系统化保护，无法应对现代LLM系统的复杂行为。作者认为应从法律合规角度系统解决LLM安全问题。

Method: 1) 基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建安全合规基准；2) 使用GRPO方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建安全推理器Compliance Reasoner。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，欧盟AI法案平均提升+10.45%，GDPR平均提升+11.85%。

Conclusion: 从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题是有效的，Compliance Reasoner能够显著提升LLM的安全合规性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到LLMs的推理过程中，解决LLMs在处理知识图谱时忽略结构信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs处理幻觉问题的主要方法是通过知识图谱，但LLMs通常将KGs视为纯文本，只提取语义信息而忽略了KGs的关键结构方面。另一个挑战是KGs编码器和LLMs文本嵌入空间之间的差距，阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: SSKG-LLM包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块和知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来保持语义的同时利用结构信息，然后通过知识图谱适应(KGA)模块使LLMs能够理解KGs嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛的实验和详细分析，探索了整合KGs结构信息如何增强LLMs的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM成功解决了LLMs在处理知识图谱时忽略结构信息的问题，并通过创新的架构设计有效整合了KGs的结构和语义信息，提升了LLMs的事实推理能力。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型经常从训练数据中复制或放大社会偏见，而其黑盒特性使得用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP中可解释性的研究主要是定性的，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中系统研究解释性与公平性的关系，关注编码器和仅解码器模型。考察三个关键维度：(1)识别偏见预测，(2)选择公平模型，(3)在模型训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为减少训练中偏见的有用监督，但在选择候选模型中的公平模型方面不可靠。

Conclusion: 输入解释在检测偏见和缓解训练偏见方面有效，但不能可靠地用于模型选择，这为公平NLP中解释性的实际应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Result: 微调Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1-0528模型；谓词可用性提升性能15-20%；T5模型超越更大的仅解码器LLMs；模型能泛化到未见过的逻辑论证。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型从训练样本中学习传递关系的能力，以及模型规模如何影响这种能力，这对于确保大语言模型事实正确性至关重要。

Method: 生成有向图来训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在不同图大小下推断传递关系的能力，特别关注网格图维度和不连通分量的影响。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维网格状有向图的连通性，图维度是预测模型能力的重要指标，高维网格图更具挑战性。增加模型规模能改善在网格图上的泛化能力，但对于包含多个不连通分量的复杂图，模型表现较差。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在结构化的网格状图上能有效学习传递关系，但在复杂的非网格图上表现有限，模型规模扩展有助于提升泛化能力但无法完全解决复杂图结构的挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

Motivation: 将自然语言处理技术应用于历史研究，特别是研究都铎王朝英格兰宗教改革时期的宗教辱骂性语言，以支持历史学家对这一时期的研究工作。

Method: 提出了从原始数据到预处理、数据选择再到迭代标注的工作流程，创建了InviTE语料库，并评估了基于历史数据预训练并针对辱骂检测微调的BERT模型与零样本提示的指令调优大语言模型的性能。

Result: 创建了包含近2000个早期现代英语句子的InviTE语料库，实验表明基于历史数据预训练并针对辱骂检测微调的模型性能优于零样本提示的LLM。

Conclusion: 基于历史数据预训练并针对特定任务微调的模型在历史文本的辱骂检测任务上表现更优，为历史研究中的NLP应用提供了有效方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim at the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques to historical research endeavors, particularly addressing the study
of religious invectives in the context of the Protestant Reformation in Tudor
England. We outline a workflow spanning from raw data, through pre-processing
and data selection, to an iterative annotation process. As a result, we
introduce the InviTE corpus -- a corpus of almost 2000 Early Modern English
(EModE) sentences, which are enriched with expert annotations regarding
invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), which highlights the
superiority of models pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned to
invective detection.

Motivation: 贝叶斯概率理论在认知科学中的应用发展，以及理性言语行为理论的成功，促使研究者探索类似贝叶斯方法在关联理论语用学中的应用可能性。

Method: 采用贝叶斯概率框架，研究会话含义这一典型语用现象，将关联理论语用学与贝叶斯计算方法相结合。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯概率方法有望为关联理论语用学提供新的计算建模框架，特别是在解释会话含义等语用现象方面。

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CHRONOBERG，一个跨越250年的英语书籍文本时间结构化语料库，用于支持语言历时变化分析和训练，强调现代LLM需要更好地处理历时语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏长期时间结构，限制了LLM理解语言语义和规范演变的能力，需要支持历时变化分析和训练的资源。

Method: 从古登堡计划中整理英语书籍文本，构建时间结构化语料库，进行时间敏感的VAD情感分析，构建历史校准的情感词典。

Result: 展示了现代LLM工具在检测歧视性语言和跨时间情感语境化方面的不足，以及语言模型在编码历时意义变化方面的困难。

Conclusion: 需要时间感知的训练和评估流程，CHRONOBERG作为可扩展资源支持语言变化和时间泛化研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes
language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers. Open

*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个使用大型语言模型分析风力涡轮机维护日志的框架，超越传统文本分类，实现深度语义分析和复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中的非结构化文本包含大量运营智能，但传统定量可靠性分析方法无法有效利用这些信息。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在文本分类层面。

Method: 引入探索性框架，使用LLM执行四种分析工作流：故障模式识别、因果链推理、站点比较分析和数据质量审计。

Result: LLM能够作为强大的"可靠性协作者"，超越标签分类，综合文本信息并生成可操作的专业级假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种新颖且可复现的方法论，将LLM用作推理工具，为风电行业解锁非结构化数据中隐藏的洞察提供了新途径。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析OLMO2模型训练数据中的政治偏见，发现左倾文档在数据集中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的偏见密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见来源尚不清楚。需要分析训练数据中的政治内容来理解偏见形成机制。

Method: 从OLMO2的预训练和后训练语料库中抽取大样本，自动标注文档的政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，并评估训练数据政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料比后训练数据包含更多政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源框架相似话题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见强相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据管理流程中整合政治内容分析，并详细记录过滤策略以确保透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Chimera测试套件，用于评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现当前模型主要依赖捷径行为而非真正的图表理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表相关基准测试中表现良好，但可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径，而非真正理解和推理图表内容。

Method: 构建包含7,500个高质量维基百科图表的Chimera测试套件，每个图表标注语义三元组和多层次问题，评估实体识别、关系理解、知识基础和视觉推理四个维度。

Result: 评估15个开源视觉语言模型发现，其强劲表现主要来自三种捷径：视觉记忆捷径影响较小，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在图表理解方面存在严重局限性，需要更鲁棒的评估协议来基准化对复杂视觉输入的真实理解能力。

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

*Maor Juliet Lavi,Tova Milo,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答问题的方法，在抽取式问答任务中有效识别信息不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在缺乏足够信息时仍自信回答导致幻觉的问题，专注于检测抽取式问答中的不可回答性。

Method: 通过激活加法识别模型激活空间中捕获不可回答性的方向，并将隐藏激活投影到该方向进行分类。

Result: 在四个抽取式QA基准测试中，该方法比现有提示和分类器方法更有效地检测不可回答问题，且具有更好的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能检测抽取式QA中的不可回答性，还能扩展到其他因素（如缺乏科学共识和主观性）导致的不可回答问题，并通过因果干预有效控制模型的弃权行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

*Antreas Ioannou,Andreas Shiamishis,Nora Hollenstein,Nezihe Merve Gürel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM构成显著挑战，准确率通常低于50%，且存在提示敏感性和对抗性脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导的时代，理解其在法律等高风险领域的能力和限制至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境下的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用多语言法律和非法律基准测试评估LLaMA和Gemini，通过字符和词级扰动评估其对抗鲁棒性，采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，并开发了开源模块化评估管道。

Result: 法律推理基准如LEXam上的准确率通常低于50%，而通用任务如XNLI上超过70%；英语结果更稳定但不总是更准确；LLaMA比Gemini弱，后者平均优势约24个百分点；语言性能与其与英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升其法律推理能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

TL;DR: NeLLCom-Lex是一个基于神经代理的框架，用于模拟词汇语义变化，通过在真实词汇系统中训练代理并操纵其交际需求来研究语义变化机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的观察性方法无法揭示因果机制，而人类实验方法难以应用于历时语义变化研究，因此需要新的模拟框架来研究语义变化的驱动因素。

Method: 使用颜色命名任务，在单一世代内模拟词汇系统的演变，通过不同的监督学习和强化学习管道训练神经代理，研究其如何发展类似人类的命名行为和词汇系统。

Result: 实验表明，经过训练以'说'现有语言的神经代理能够在颜色命名中显著再现类似人类的模式，支持进一步使用NeLLCom-Lex来阐明语义变化机制。

Conclusion: NeLLCom-Lex框架能够有效模拟语义变化过程，为理解词汇语义变化的因果机制提供了新的研究途径。

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Method: 提出解决方案分歧作为新指标，将其应用于监督微调和强化学习策略，在三个代表性问题领域进行测试验证。

Result: 研究发现更高的解决方案分歧与更好的问题解决能力正相关，使用解决方案分歧指标能够持续提高成功率。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进大语言模型的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、可扩展且高度可解释的LLM表示方式，能够实时适应动态扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化单一对齐目标时会覆盖其他目标的表示（灾难性遗忘），而简单的多分支设计会导致不同目标间输出不一致（推理碎片化）。

Method: 两阶段1-to-N框架：阶段I计算共享表示，阶段II通过策略参考机制在并行分支中进行目标特定控制，保持跨目标一致性。

Result: 在Alpaca、BeaverTails和TruthfulQA上的实验显示，AMBS在多个7B LLM上显著提升HHH对齐，DeepSeek-7B平均对齐分数提升+32.4%，不安全输出减少11.0%。

Conclusion: AMBS能够有效统一高效地进行多目标对齐，在保持跨目标一致性的同时提升对齐性能，与最先进方法竞争力相当。

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个端到端的FP8训练方案，通过细粒度混合精度量化策略，在保持数值精度的同时显著提升大语言模型训练效率，相比BF16基线可减少22%训练时间、14%内存使用，并提升19%吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本阻碍了创新，虽然FP8训练理论上能显著提升效率，但由于缺乏开源训练方案而未能广泛应用。

Method: 采用端到端的FP8训练方案，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合精度量化策略来平衡数值精度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方案不仅稳定且基本无损，在推理基准测试中性能与BF16基线相当，同时显著提升训练效率。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且稳健的替代方案，将发布相关代码以促进大规模模型训练的民主化。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Conclusion: 认知推理范式成功弥合了逻辑推理与社会认知之间的差距，CogFlow框架为LLMs提供了有效的社会情境处理能力。

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

### [257] [Retrieval-Augmented Guardrails for AI-Drafted Patient-Portal Messages: Error Taxonomy Construction and Large-Scale Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22565)
*Wenyuan Chen,Fateme Nateghi Haredasht,Kameron C. Black,Francois Grolleau,Emily Alsentzer,Jonathan H. Chen,Stephen P. Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，利用历史消息-响应对来改进LLM生成的患者消息回复质量评估，显著提升了错误检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR门户中的异步患者-临床医生消息增加了临床医生工作量，LLM可以协助起草回复，但其输出可能存在临床不准确、遗漏或语气不匹配等问题，需要稳健的评估方法。

Method: 提出了三方面贡献：(1)基于归纳编码和专家裁决开发了包含5个领域59个细粒度错误代码的临床错误本体；(2)开发了检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，利用语义相似的历史消息-响应对提高判断质量；(3)使用DSPy的两阶段提示架构实现可扩展、可解释的分层错误检测。

Result: 在1,500多条患者消息上比较了基线和参考增强评估，检索上下文改进了临床完整性和工作流程适当性等领域的错误识别。在100条消息上的人工验证显示，上下文增强标签比基线具有更好的协议一致性(50% vs. 33%)和性能(F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256)。

Conclusion: RAEC管道可作为患者消息的AI护栏，检索上下文显著提升了LLM生成回复的质量评估效果。

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究使用LLMs定位上下文幻觉（模型输出中无法从源文本验证的信息），构建了专门的基准测试，提出了基于自由文本描述的新表示方法，评估了四种大型LLM，发现最佳模型F1分数仅为0.67，并分析了任务挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复杂评估流程不实用，需要研究LLMs在定位上下文幻觉方面的适用性，并解决现有幻觉表示方法限制错误类型表达的问题。

Method: 构建针对LLMs的基准测试（包含1000多个人工标注示例），提出基于自由文本描述的幻觉表示方法，评估四种大型LLM，分析最佳提示策略和任务挑战因素。

Result: 基准测试具有挑战性，最佳模型F1分数仅为0.67；识别出两个主要挑战因素：错误标记缺失细节为不一致，以及处理与模型参数知识一致但源文本中不存在的事实信息时存在困难。

Conclusion: LLMs在定位上下文幻觉方面表现有限，需要改进提示策略和处理模型参数知识干扰的问题；提出的新表示方法能更好地捕捉各种可能的错误类型。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

Motivation: 研究次正则层次结构是否为自然语言结构建模提供严谨且可解释的基础。

Method: 通过判定谓词表示次正则语言类，使用线性模型进行学习，并在合成数据和英语形态学真实数据上进行实验验证。

Result: 合成实验在无噪声条件下证实了完美可分性，真实数据实验显示学习到的特征与已知语言约束一致。

Conclusion: 次正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严谨且可解释的基础。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable
when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite
observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the
subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is

Motivation: 随着自然语言处理技术的发展，计算建模审议过程成为可能，这有助于通过分析意见转变来预测不同情境下的潜在结果。

Method: 收集来自不同背景个体的意见构建数据集，使用富含显著事实的产品演示模拟审议过程，比较频率话语调节和量子审议框架两种模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果在公共政策制定、辩论评估、决策支持框架和大规模社交媒体意见挖掘方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media
opinion mining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往低估了评估指标的整体变异性，需要同时考虑模型和数据相关的变异来源来准确量化不确定性。

Method: 使用重采样方法来计算评估指标的不确定性，包括平均/中位数、模型间差异和排名等指标。

Result: 在多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等任务中验证了该方法能更准确地反映性能指标的变异性。

Conclusion: 重采样方法是量化NLP基准测试中评估指标不确定性的有效工具，能避免低估整体变异性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种通过后训练高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的训练流程，能够提升循环神经网络的长上下文记忆能力，而不会显著增加模型参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长上下文时成本高昂，而RNN虽然具有恒定的每token复杂度，但在长上下文信息记忆方面表现不佳。现有研究表明记忆能力与循环状态大小正相关，但直接训练大状态RNN成本过高。

Method: 针对线性注意力和状态空间模型两类流行RNN，设计了后训练架构修改，在不增加或仅轻微增加模型参数的情况下扩展状态大小。

Result: 在高达13亿参数的模型上实验表明，StateX能有效提升RNN的记忆能力和上下文学习能力，且不会产生高后训练成本或损害其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文记忆方面的局限性，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一个变分推理框架，将语言模型的思维轨迹作为隐变量，通过变分推理进行优化，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言模型的推理能力提供原则性的概率视角，统一变分推理与强化学习方法，获得更稳定的训练目标。

Method: 从证据下界(ELBO)出发，扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式化来稳定变分后验的训练。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上验证了方法的有效性，在广泛的推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该工作为改进语言模型推理能力提供了原则性的概率视角，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法，并产生了稳定的目标。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

*Renjie Luo,Zichen Liu,Xiangyan Liu,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wenhu Chen,Wei Lu,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略(FCP)，将语言反馈作为条件信号直接学习，而非压缩为标量奖励，通过离线最大似然训练和在线自举阶段实现反馈驱动的条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息丢失和尺度不平衡问题，需要更直接利用语言反馈的方法。

Method: FCP从响应-反馈对中学习，通过最大似然训练近似反馈条件后验分布，并引入在线自举阶段在正向条件下生成并接收新反馈进行优化。

Result: 将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLM提供了更丰富的从语言反馈中直接学习的方式。

Conclusion: FCP框架能够更有效地利用语言反馈的丰富信息，避免标量奖励的信息损失问题，为LLM训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，仅使用n-gram新颖性来评估文本创造力存在不足，因为创造力需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性。研究表明，91%的高n-gram新颖性表达并未被专家判定为有创造力，且开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性与低实用性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨n-gram新颖性作为创造力衡量指标的局限性，因为创造力理论强调需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性两个维度。

Method: 通过7542份专家标注（26名专家）对人工和AI生成文本进行细读评估，分析新颖性、实用性和合理性之间的关系，并测试不同LLM识别创造性表达的能力。

Result: 研究发现n-gram新颖性与专家判定的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达未被判定为有创造力；开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性与低实用性相关；前沿闭源模型产生创造性表达的可能性低于人类。

Conclusion: 结论是仅依赖n-gram新颖性评估创造力存在风险，需要综合考虑新颖性和适当性；前沿LLM在识别创造性表达方面表现优于随机但仍有改进空间，特别是在识别非实用表达方面。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的代码生成智能体在网站代码生成任务中仅依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法有效评估生成代码的实际视觉质量和用户体验。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，使用视觉语言模型分析网站截图和GUI测试结果生成详细文本描述和建议，结合回溯和最优选择机制；并引入Step-GRPO训练方法，将视觉评分作为过程监督信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升至51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升至3.9；Step-GRPO训练使Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct准确率从38.9%提升至45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升至3.7。

Conclusion: 多级视觉反馈机制和Step-GRPO训练方法能显著提升网站代码生成的质量和准确性，为视觉密集型代码生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估语音AI助手的全面能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含10,497个示例的基准测试，涵盖13个任务类别，包括自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及异质图像观看任务。评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio。

Result: 发现：(1)专有模型并非全面优于开源模型；(2)大多数模型擅长说话任务但在音频理解方面落后；(3)设计良好的小模型可以媲美大模型。Step-Audio-2-mini(7B)的听力准确率是LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual的两倍多。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态输入和角色扮演任务上仍有困难，在鲁棒性和安全对齐方面存在显著差距。VoiceAssistant-Eval为下一代AI助手的发展提供了评估框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品零售业中因供应过剩导致的食物浪费和产品短缺问题，通过优化客户购买行为与供应策略之间的平衡。

Method: 首先从杂货店销售数据中发现连续时间马尔可夫链形式的随机过程模型，然后扩展供应活动，最后进行假设分析评估产品数量随时间变化。

Result: 能够识别客户购买行为与供应策略之间的最优平衡，帮助防止因供应过剩导致的食物浪费和产品短缺。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品零售过程分析提供了有效工具，有助于减少食物浪费并优化供应链管理。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和顶盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重分配持续改善了稳定性和准确性，特别是在高佩克莱特数对流扩散问题中，传统求解器失败时PINNs仍能获得稳定准确的预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的权重分配方案增强了PINNs在计算流体动力学问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能够作为通用实验设计代理进行上下文实验设计

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优LLMs应用于基因扰动和分子属性发现任务，并提出了LLMNN混合方法

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，传统方法如线性bandits和高斯过程优化始终优于LLM代理，LLMNN方法在不同领域实现了竞争性或更优性能

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在实践中无法执行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法无法在缺乏任务数据的情况下，将数据层面的期望（透明性和忠实性）与参数空间优化相连接的问题。

Method: 提出零空间投影器过滤新任务向量中的重叠组件以确保透明性，同时使用轻量级LoRA适配器注入互补的任务特定信号以实现忠实性。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均准确率比OPCM和WUDI-Merging提高4-7%，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过联合过滤-适应过程，使主干网络能够吸收新知识同时保留现有行为，无需额外参数或推理成本。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Method: 采用基于Transformer的自回归模型，直接从波形数据中学习时间和空间依赖关系，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有望支持引力波探测器中的牛顿噪声缓解和实时控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM创建过程允许额外的人工输入，可以纠正偏见或融入领域特定知识，为低资源表格问题提供可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

Motivation: 传统IGNs需要对抗训练且易出现训练不稳定和模式崩溃问题，而扩散模型虽然稳定但计算成本高。希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 从预训练扩散模型的分数中蒸馏出幂等模型(SIGN)，无需对抗损失，支持多步采样和零样本编辑。

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现了幂等模型的最先进结果，推理速度比迭代分数模型更快。

Conclusion: SIGN成功结合了扩散模型和IGNs的优势，提供了稳定训练、高效推理和灵活采样能力的生成模型。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: GenUQ提供了一种有效的无需似然的不确定性量化框架，在算子学习中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: TFNO-opt架构为复杂储层系统的有效控制开辟了新途径，在保持物理过程准确性的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Result: 建立了幻觉率的高概率下界，证实了损失最小化与人类偏好之间的根本性冲突。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间结构性错配的结果，源于模型校准错误导致的估计误差。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Conclusion: 该方法无需地面真实状态或再分析数据，适用于参考信息有限的环境，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Result: 在复杂流动场景中表现出鲁棒性，包括von Karman涡旋脱落、韧带断裂和气泡粘附等，支持在粗网格上训练并在细网格上泛化。

Conclusion: 为建模动力学系统建立了一条新的数据驱动途径，能够有效处理不同动力学数据集，不受特定碰撞模型形式的限制。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedZero是一种联邦零阶优化算法，在联邦凸设置下实现接近最优的优化误差界，并在单工作器场景下为凸零阶优化建立了首个高概率收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式学习中的梯度自由零阶优化问题，旨在开发具有严格理论保证的联邦零阶算法，弥补传统期望收敛结果的不足。

Method: FedZero采用基于ℓ1-球面上随机化的梯度估计器，并开发了ℓ1-球面均匀测度下Lipschitz函数的新浓度不等式。

Result: FedZero在联邦凸设置下以高概率实现接近最优的优化误差界，在单工作器场景下建立了凸零阶优化的首个高概率收敛保证。

Conclusion: FedZero算法提供了强大的理论保证，其开发的浓度不等式工具不仅对高概率保证至关重要，也具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphPFN是一个基于先验数据拟合网络的节点级预测模型，通过在设计的合成图先验分布上预训练，结合图注意力聚合层，在真实图数据集上表现出强大的上下文学习能力和最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型主要依赖手工制作的图特征，限制了学习复杂图特定模式的能力。本文旨在通过设计合成图先验分布来构建更有效的图基础模型。

Method: 1. 设计合成属性图的先验分布：使用多个随机块模型和优先连接过程的组合生成图结构，应用图感知结构化因果模型生成节点属性和目标。2. 在LimiX表基础模型基础上添加基于注意力的图邻域聚合层，在合成图上进行训练。

Result: 在多达50,000个节点的多样化真实世界图数据集上，GraphPFN表现出强大的上下文学习性能，并在微调后达到最先进的结果，在大多数数据集上优于G2T-FM和从头开始训练的任务特定GNN。

Conclusion: 在精心设计的先验分布上对合成图进行预训练是构建图基础模型的有效策略，GraphPFN展示了这一方法的成功应用。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

*Arani Roy,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlimDiff是一种无需梯度的扩散模型压缩框架，通过激活信息指导的结构压缩，在保持生成质量的同时减少参数和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优秀，但计算成本高昂，现有效率技术依赖微调或重新训练来恢复性能，存在瓶颈。

Method: 将扩散模型压缩重新定义为谱逼近任务，利用去噪时间步的激活协方差定义低秩子空间，在固定压缩预算下指导动态剪枝，对功能权重组进行模块化分解。

Result: 相比基线方法实现高达35%的加速和约1亿参数减少，生成质量与未压缩模型相当，仅需约500个校准样本，比先前方法少70倍以上。

Conclusion: 这是首个无需训练、基于闭式解的激活引导扩散模型结构压缩方法，兼具理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于评分标准的奖励机制来解决强化学习微调中的奖励过优化问题，通过利用离策略示例构建能够区分优秀和良好响应的评分标准，有效缓解奖励信号被黑客攻击的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调(RFT)经常遭受奖励过优化问题，即策略模型通过黑客奖励信号获得高分但产生低质量输出。理论分析表明关键在于高奖励尾部的奖励错误设定：无法可靠地区分优秀响应和良好响应。

Method: 研究基于评分标准的奖励机制，通过设计评分标准来利用离策略示例（如来自更强模型或重写的示例），同时保持对它们伪影的不敏感性。引入区分优秀和多样化响应的工作流程来获取高奖励尾部的评分标准。

Result: 实证研究表明，基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过优化问题，并提供了有效的LLM后训练改进。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决强化学习微调中奖励过优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略示例同时避免奖励错误设定。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Motivation: 现有表示学习方法在平衡生成质量和判别性能方面存在不足，需要统一框架来同时服务判别性和生成性应用。

Method: 扩展MIM框架，加入对比目标，提出信息嵌入技术从编码器-解码器模型中提取增强特征。

Result: 在视觉和分子基准测试中，cMIM在分类和回归任务上优于MIM和InfoNCE，同时保持竞争性的重建质量。

Conclusion: cMIM作为表示学习的统一框架，有效推进了同时服务判别性和生成性应用的模型发展。

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

TL;DR: DistillKac是一个快速图像生成器，使用阻尼波动方程及其随机Kac表示来以有限速度移动概率质量。相比扩散模型，它强制有限速度传输并产生全局有界动能，通过端点蒸馏实现高质量样本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的反向时间速度可能变得刚性并隐含允许无界传播速度，而Kac动力学强制有限速度传输并产生全局有界动能，提供更好的数值稳定性。

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示，引入速度空间的分类器自由引导，提出端点蒸馏训练学生模型匹配冻结教师模型在长区间上的行为。

Result: 实验表明DistillKac能够以非常少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac结合了有限速度传输的理论优势和端点蒸馏的实践效率，在保持数值稳定性的同时实现了快速高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Li₂的数学框架，用于分析两层非线性网络中的grokking现象，揭示了三个关键阶段：惰性学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习，并解释了权重衰减、学习率等超参数在延迟泛化中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但对于复杂结构化输入中特征如何出现、何时出现以及出现条件仍缺乏数学框架来表征。

Method: 提出Li₂框架，通过分析反向传播梯度GF的结构来表征三个学习阶段：惰性学习阶段GF随机；独立特征学习阶段每个节点的梯度仅依赖于自身激活；交互特征学习阶段隐藏节点相互作用。

Result: 证明了独立动力学遵循能量函数E的梯度上升，其局部最大值正是涌现的特征；揭示了权重衰减如何使GF携带目标标签信息；证明了隐藏节点如何相互作用以及GF如何聚焦于需要学习的缺失特征。

Conclusion: 该研究阐明了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等关键超参数在grokking中的作用，推导了记忆和泛化的可证明缩放规律，并从梯度动力学第一原理揭示了Muon等优化器有效性的根本原因。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过整合教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器，重新设计了半监督学习的结构。该框架将SSL建模为三个角色之间的结构化交互，使用互信息选择伪标签，并通过Stackelberg博弈进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键限制，包括静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模。

Method: 构建三元交互结构：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师，以及扰动嵌入以发现决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。使用互信息而非置信度选择伪标签，并将整个交互形式化为Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签情况下始终达到最先进的性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉主干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一个原则性和可泛化的解决方案，通过三元博弈论协同训练框架有效解决了现有SSL框架的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF在训练阶段有效，但在推理时无法提供安全保障，仍可能产生不安全内容。需要一种在推理时确保LLM安全的方法。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，估计轨迹的最坏情况演化。包含运行时监控器和最小限制的转向滤波器。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测到不安全延续。显著减少不安全生成，同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生较少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or

collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs中的归纳头是否能够支持更复杂的、具有层次结构的重复模式学习，而不仅仅是基础的词元复制机制。

Method: 设计了一个合成的上下文学习任务，其中词元以层次依赖关系重复出现，并评估了多种LLMs在这些词元序列和自然语言类似情况上的表现。

Result: 发现了自适应归纳头，这些头通过上下文学习来决定关注什么内容。同时发现学习过程受到能够揭示一组潜在上下文的注意力头的支持。

Conclusion: 不仅证明了LLMs具有能够学习的归纳头，还提供了关于LLMs如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Motivation: LLM的自我意识和感知能力日益受到关注，具有重要的安全和政策影响，但目前测量这些能力的科学仍处于起步阶段。

Method: 受非人类动物元认知研究启发，该方法避免模型自我报告，而是测试模型在多大程度上能够战略性地部署内部状态知识，使用两种实验范式分析模型的行为表现和token概率。

Conclusion: LLMs确实表现出元认知能力，但这些能力有限且与人类不同，模型后训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Conclusion: 本书系统性地介绍了在不确定性下进行选择的统计理论框架，为机器学习的理论基础提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

TL;DR: 提出Gumbel动力学模型(GDM)，通过连续松弛离散状态和Gumbel分布的噪声模型，扩展状态动态范围，实现更平滑的动力学建模和可扩展训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切换动力系统由于离散状态特性，难以捕捉平滑、变速的过渡以及随机混合状态，在真实数据中常出现虚假快速切换问题。

Conclusion: GDM通过连续松弛方法有效解决了传统切换动力系统的局限性，在建模复杂时间序列时表现出更好的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Motivation: 联邦持续学习中，数据异构性、通信限制和隐私问题加剧了灾难性遗忘的挑战，需要新的解决方案来保护先前任务的知识。

Method: 将客户端更新投影到先前学习表示的正交补空间，减少对早期任务的干扰；同时利用核心基向量预测任务身份，动态调整全局模型输出。

Result: 在标准联邦持续学习基准测试中，FedProTIP在平均准确率上显著优于最先进方法，特别是在任务身份未知的设置中。

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为分布式设备上的流式数据学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种基于一次性高阶SVD的低秩激活压缩框架，用于设备端学习和持续学习，显著减少内存使用同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效的学习方法，但现有激活压缩方法依赖重复的低秩分解，带来计算开销，且未在持续学习场景中探索。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，避免重复分解，并将任务分配到正交子空间实现持续学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，保持与完整反向传播相当的准确性；在持续学习基准测试中，以极低内存成本实现与正交梯度投影方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: LANCE为边缘设备上的高效微调和持续学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种动态切换训练方法，在ViT-Large模型训练早期使用全参数训练，后期切换到低秩适应(LoRA)，大幅减少可训练参数并提升效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型训练资源消耗巨大，且大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，后期权重变化趋于稳定，可以用低秩矩阵捕捉

Method: 通过用户定义超参数确定切换点，根据各模块层的收敛程度分配特定秩，从全参数训练动态切换到LoRA

Result: 保持模型精度的同时，将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别部分收敛状态，动态调整训练策略，在保证性能的同时显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法HIP，无需自动微分或有限差分，比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高，且在过渡态搜索、几何优化等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都面临这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递中计算得到的不可约表示特征（l=2），构建SE(3)-等变、对称的Hessian矩阵，实现直接预测。

Result: HIP方法比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高，训练更容易，系统规模扩展性更好，在过渡态搜索、几何优化等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 直接预测Hessian矩阵的方法HIP在计算化学任务中表现出色，提供了更高效的计算方案，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LoRA方法受限于名义秩的问题，以及HiRA等扩展方法中全局调制带来的限制，需要更灵活的局部调制机制。

Method: 将权重矩阵分区，在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时实现局部秩放大。

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，使用Llama-3.2 1B/3B、Mistral-7B和Gemma-2 9B模型，BHRA在相同参数预算下持续超越强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: 块状设计在保持丰富频谱的同时缓解了全局调制引起的崩溃，为参数高效微调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能系统中安全、信任和通用人工智能这些概念缺乏严格的数学定义，研究旨在为这些概念提供形式化定义并探索它们之间的关系。

Method: 作者定义了安全（系统从不做出错误声明）、信任（假设系统是安全的）和AGI（AI系统始终匹配或超越人类能力）的数学概念，并通过形式化证明展示它们之间的不兼容性。

Result: 核心发现是：根据这些形式化定义，一个安全且受信任的AI系统不能是AGI系统，因为存在某些任务实例，人类可以轻松且可证明地解决，但系统无法解决。

Conclusion: 安全、信任和通用人工智能在严格数学定义下存在根本性冲突，这类似于哥德尔不完备定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性的结果。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时适应提供了一条原则性、高效的技术路线。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

Method: 将学习问题构建为单一可微分优化任务，采用最一般形式，避免先前方法的不现实简化。

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但可以描述兼容参数和结构的完整集合，并在温和假设下建立了马尔可夫等价类的可识别性。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to

integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

TL;DR: MMPlanner是一个零样本多模态程序规划框架，通过对象状态推理思维链提示显式建模对象状态转换，生成准确的多模态计划，在规划和跨模态对齐方面实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用大语言模型优化文本步骤，但视觉对象状态对齐和系统评估研究不足，需要解决跨模态对象状态一致性问题

Method: 提出对象状态推理思维链提示来显式建模对象状态转换，设计LLM作为评判者的协议评估计划质量和跨模态对齐，并提出视觉步骤重排序任务衡量时间连贯性

Result: 在RECIPEPLAN和WIKIPLAN数据集上，MMPlanner在文本规划上提升+6.8%，跨模态对齐提升+11.9%，视觉步骤排序提升+26.7%

Conclusion: MMPlanner通过显式建模对象状态转换和系统评估方法，在多模态程序规划任务中取得了显著改进，证明了对象状态推理的重要性

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

### [315] [Logic of Hypotheses: from Zero to Full Knowledge in Neurosymbolic Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21663)
*Davide Bizzaro,Alessandro Daniele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Logic of Hypotheses (LoH)语言，统一了神经符号集成中的规则注入和规则学习两种方法，通过选择操作符实现可学习的符号规则，支持任意程度的知识规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号集成领域存在两种主要方法：将手工规则注入神经网络模型，以及从数据中归纳符号规则。需要一种统一框架来灵活整合数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验知识。

Method: LoH扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择操作符，从选项池中选择子公式。使用模糊逻辑将LoH公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。采用Goedel模糊逻辑和Goedel技巧实现无性能损失的离散化。

Result: 在表格数据和Visual Tic-Tac-Toe神经符号任务上表现出色，同时生成可解释的决策规则。模型可以离散化为硬布尔值函数而不会损失性能。

Conclusion: LoH为神经符号集成提供了统一框架，支持从纯数据驱动到纯符号规范的连续谱系，实现了高性能和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

*Joshua Salim,Jordan Yu,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DIM正则化方法，通过在深度神经网络中强制领域知识驱动的单调性约束来防止过拟合，提高模型泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易过拟合，会记忆训练数据中的噪声而非学习泛化模式。需要一种方法来保持领域知识中的单调关系，提高预测性能

Method: 通过惩罚相对于线性基线的单调性违规来强制单调性，建立数学框架包括线性参考、单调偏差测量，并将这些测量整合到训练目标中

Result: 在芝加哥网约车数据集和合成数据集上的实验表明，即使适度的单调性约束也能持续提升各种神经网络架构的性能

Conclusion: DIM方法通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为，减轻过拟合，从而提升深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neuroprobe是一个用于颅内脑电图(iEEG)解码任务的标准化评估框架，基于BrainTreebank数据集，包含10名受试者在自然电影观看任务中的40小时iEEG记录，旨在推动脑机接口和神经基础模型的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏标准化的iEEG模型评估框架，需要严谨的基准来区分竞争性建模方法，以支持下一代脑机接口和神经治疗的发展。

Method: 基于BrainTreebank数据集构建Neuroprobe解码任务套件，利用iEEG的高时空分辨率，系统测量语言处理特征在时间和空间上的可解码性，并提供公开代码和排行榜。

Result: 发现线性基线模型表现惊人地强，在许多任务上击败了前沿的基础模型；可视化展示了信息从颞上回流向前额叶皮层，以及从简单听觉特征到复杂语言特征的进展。

Conclusion: Neuroprobe既可作为神经科学洞察的来源，也可作为比较竞争架构和训练协议的严谨框架，旨在促进iEEG基础模型领域的快速发展。

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at
https://neuroprobe.dev/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlotFM是一个可穿戴加速度计基础模型，通过时频槽注意力机制处理原始信号的时域和频域表示，生成多个小嵌入来捕捉不同信号组件，在16个分类和回归下游任务中超越现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注日常活动分类，限制了其在依赖其他信号特征的更广泛任务中的适用性。

Method: 使用时频槽注意力扩展槽注意力，处理信号的时域和频域表示，生成多个小嵌入；引入两个损失正则化器捕捉局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，其余任务达到可比性能，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了传感基础模型的强大泛化能力，能够适应超出标准人类活动识别的多样化任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将K-means聚类问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化问题的新方法，使用二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法求解，相比现有方法收敛更快且保持最优统计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K-means聚类是一个困难的离散优化问题。现有的非凸方法如低秩半定规划在统计和局部算法保证方面表现良好，但由于问题的组合结构，当前松弛算法难以平衡约束可行性和目标最优性，在计算具有严格保证的二阶临界点时面临巨大挑战。

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化，并刻画其黎曼结构，使用二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法求解。通过将K-means流形分解为乘积流形，每个牛顿子问题可以在线性时间内求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的方法收敛速度显著快于当前最先进的一阶非负低秩分解方法，同时实现了类似的统计精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为K-means聚类提供了一种高效的二阶优化框架，在保持统计精度的同时大幅提升了收敛速度。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

TL;DR: Prophecy是一个自动推断前馈神经网络形式化属性的工具，通过提取基于神经元激活状态的规则作为前提条件来推导期望的输出属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络的大量逻辑信息被捕获在内部层神经元的激活状态中，这为形式化属性推断提供了基础。

Method: 基于神经元激活值或开关状态提取规则作为前提条件，这些规则表示隐含在隐藏层中的网络属性，能够推导出期望的输出行为。

Result: 开发了Prophecy工具，展示了其在不同类型模型和输出属性上的应用，包括形式化解释、组合验证、运行时监控、修复等。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大规模视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够有效推断和证明神经网络的形式化属性。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

TL;DR: SpecMER是一个通过k-mer引导的推测解码框架，在蛋白质序列生成中整合生物先验知识，在保持效率的同时显著提高序列合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中生成新序列时存在延迟问题，且传统推测解码中的草稿模型忽略蛋白质结构和功能约束，导致生物不可信的输出。

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序，并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物模式的序列。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然性。

Conclusion: SpecMER成功将生物先验知识整合到推测解码中，在保持效率的同时显著提高了生成蛋白质序列的生物学合理性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种正交改进方法，通过使用最少的辅助信息来提升仅基于PPG的心搏停止预测系统性能，包括时间到事件建模、患者身份不变性学习和伪标签回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生理基础模型虽然能预测心搏停止等关键事件，但在下游数据/标签稀缺时，其强大表示能力未能得到充分利用。

Method: 1) 时间到事件建模（回归事件发生时间或离散生存分析）；2) 通过对抗训练使模型学习心搏停止相关特征而非患者身份特征；3) 使用预训练辅助网络生成的伪标签值进行回归。

Result: 提出的方法将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，在较长时间范围内有显著改进，且事件临近时性能下降最小。

Conclusion: 这些改进推动了早期预警系统的研究，并通过PCGrad优化技术缓解了多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Motivation: 在图级预测任务中，子图信息至关重要，但构建兼具高判别性和可解释性的模型仍是挑战

Method: 使用精确子图枚举与神经网络结合，通过稀疏正则化实现有效剪枝策略和重要子图识别

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选择的子图进行后验分析

Conclusion: EIN成功结合子图枚举和神经网络，在保持高性能的同时提供了可解释性

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异质性持续挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖所有客户端参与全局训练后进行本地适应，需要更早阶段的质量控制。

Method: 从客户端原始数据提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户端间数据集相似性，基于相似性估计实现客户端选择策略，让客户端与数据分布兼容的其他客户端协作。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上测试，与三种现有联邦学习算法集成，PQFed持续提升目标客户端模型性能，即使在参与者数量有限的情况下。相比基线IFCA算法，在低参与度场景下表现更好。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中具有可扩展性和有效性，能够改善数据异质性带来的性能挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双层优化问题包含嵌套的上层和下层优化问题，其中下层问题的最优性定义了上层问题的约束。由于这种嵌套结构，双层优化具有复杂的定义，相比其他贝叶斯优化的标准扩展（如多目标或约束设置）研究较少。

Result: 通过多个基准数据集实证验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 信息论方法能够有效处理双层优化问题，通过统一标准同时优化两个层次的问题。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed

TL;DR: 开发了一个可解释的时空图神经网络框架，利用双随机微分方程建模不规则采样的纵向fMRI数据，预测阿尔茨海默病的进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别客观的神经影像生物标志物来预测阿尔茨海默病进展对于及时干预至关重要，但由于脑网络时空特征的复杂功能障碍常被现有方法忽视，这项任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用可解释的时空图神经网络框架，通过双随机微分方程建模不规则采样的纵向fMRI数据，学习稀疏的区域和连接重要性概率。

Result: 在两个独立队列（OASIS-3和ADNI）上验证有效，识别出海马旁回、前额叶皮层和顶叶等关键区域，以及腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著中断，这些异常与纵向AD相关临床症状密切相关。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了已建立和新的神经系统水平和性别特异性生物标志物，为AD进展的神经生物学机制提供了新见解，突显了基于时空图的学习在早期个体化预测AD进展方面的潜力。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

TL;DR: POLO是一个基于大语言模型的先导化合物优化框架，通过偏好引导的多轮优化策略，在有限评估次数下实现高效的分子优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法在样本效率方面表现不佳，而现有基于LLM的方法未能充分利用其上下文学习和指令跟随能力来处理迭代优化过程。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化(PGPO)算法，通过轨迹级优化和轮级偏好学习的双层次学习机制，从完整的优化轨迹中学习。

Result: 在单属性任务上达到84%的平均成功率(比基线好2.3倍)，在多属性任务上达到50%成功率，仅需500次评估。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用每次昂贵的评估，显著提升了分子优化的样本效率，推动了该领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Motivation: 现有脑图学习方法难以选择性学习疾病相关知识，导致参数和计算成本过高，限制了实际临床应用

Method: 包含病理模式过滤器提取高疾病相关性子图构建PathoGraph，以及病理特征蒸馏模块减少疾病无关噪声特征并增强病理特征

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，BrainPoG在模型性能和计算效率方面均表现出优越性

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，避免无关信息，实现高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

TL;DR: HyperCore是一个针对噪声环境的鲁棒自适应核心集选择框架，利用轻量级超球面模型和Youden's J统计量自动选择剪枝阈值，无需超参数调优，在噪声和低数据情况下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法通常忽略标注错误的可能性且需要固定剪枝比例，在实际应用中不实用。

Method: 使用每类轻量级超球面模型，将类内样本嵌入到超球面中心附近，基于距离自然分离类外样本，通过Youden's J统计量自适应选择剪枝阈值。

Result: 在噪声和低数据情况下，HyperCore始终优于最先进的核心集选择方法，有效丢弃错误标注和模糊点。

Conclusion: HyperCore产生紧凑且信息丰富的子集，适用于可扩展和无噪声学习。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法需要在整个数据集上计算昂贵的训练信号（如梯度、决策边界估计），这与核心集选择的高效目的相矛盾。

Method: 引入统一目标函数结合子模覆盖度和密度，采用基于闭式解的采样策略，通过单一超参数控制局部密度测量的期望覆盖度。

Result: 无需训练即可匹配基于训练的基线方法，在高剪枝率下显著优于它们，计算开销大幅降低，对标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore在现实场景中展示了实际有效性和可扩展性，为高效核心集选择提供了训练免费的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常报告手部灵巧性问题和认知疲劳，但损伤往往细微难以检测。研究旨在发现解释认知疲劳的脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的MS患者和12名匹配对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧性测试，使用fNIRS记录双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层活动，采用机器学习分类分析。

Result: K-近邻分类器在单任务中准确率达75.0%，双任务中66.7%。XAI显示最重要的脑区是对侧半球上缘/角回和中央前回，MS组活动抑制且神经血管反应较慢。脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标。

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了有效信息准则(EIC)来衡量符号回归中公式的结构合理性，通过检测数值不稳定性和舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构，提升公式的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性的代理，忽略了公式的内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但难以数学分析和解释。

Method: 将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过检测数据流经系统时的有效数字丢失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构，提出有效信息准则(EIC)。

Result: EIC与搜索式符号回归算法结合改善了Pareto前沿性能，减少了结果中的不合理结构；与生成式算法结合将预训练所需样本数减少了2-4倍；与108位人类专家的可解释性偏好有70.2%的一致性。

Conclusion: EIC通过测量公式中的不合理结构，实际上反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了更有效的结构合理性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面潜力显著，但其实际部署受到训练过程过慢的限制，主要原因是每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应，使得生成阶段成为主要性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出并发感知推测解码框架，根据实时并发级别动态调整草稿和验证策略；引入在线草稿学习机制，使草稿模型能够利用目标模型的反馈信号持续适应。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，在效率上显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈问题，通过并发感知推测解码和在线草稿学习机制，显著提升了训练效率，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as

focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of

Motivation: 传统混沌系统预测模型缺乏泛化能力，无法应对现实世界中零样本或小样本的新系统预测需求。

Method: 提出ChaosNexus基础模型，采用名为ScaleFormer的多尺度架构，结合专家混合层来捕捉通用模式和系统特定行为。

Result: 在9000多个合成混沌系统测试中，长期吸引子统计保真度提升40%以上；在5天全球天气预报中，零样本平均误差低于1度，小样本微调后效果更佳。

Conclusion: 科学基础模型的跨系统泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性，而非单纯的数据量。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Conclusion: 未来工作可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）在该领域的缩放规律，并与已训练模型进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Motivation: SAM方法被广泛用于寻找更平坦的极小值以提升泛化能力，但作者发现该方法可能收敛到虚假的极小值点。

Method: 理论证明了虚假极小值点的存在性，建立了局部收敛到这些点的条件，并通过实证验证了实际收敛情况。

Result: 证明了SAM确实可能收敛到虚假极小值点，这些点不是原始目标的真正极小值。

Conclusion: 提出了一个简单有效的补救措施来避免收敛到虚假极小值点。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决在线多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励挑战。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

TL;DR: 本文首次对掩码离散扩散中的Euler采样器进行了严格理论分析，提出了MATU方法，在消除有界分数假设的同时实现了近乎无ε的复杂度，证明了掩码离散扩散在文本生成中优于均匀扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，对掩码离散扩散的理论理解不足，特别是忽略了广泛使用的Euler采样器、施加了限制性假设，未能展示掩码扩散相对于均匀扩散的优势。

Method: 分析了Euler采样器在掩码离散扩散中的性能，提出了Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)方法，利用每个token最多被解掩码一次的特性来优化复杂度。

Result: Euler采样器可在总变差距离上达到ε精度，需要O(d²ε^{-3/2})次离散分数评估；MATU方法实现了O(d ln d·(1-ε²))的复杂度，消除了ln(1/ε)因子，显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 研究为掩码离散扩散提供了严格的理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，为分析基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

Conclusion: 该框架为草图双线性形式提供了统一分析，在多个应用领域获得了更优的理论保证，特别是降低了算法复杂度对维度的依赖。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

TL;DR: 提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，将长上下文建模问题形式化为压缩问题，通过动态构建输入依赖的协作结构来最大化信息理论压缩目标，显著提升多智能体系统在长文档问答任务中的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有模型无关的长上下文建模方法依赖手工设计的多智能体协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力，需要更原则性的框架来提升性能。

Method: 基于信息理论压缩目标，提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，动态构建输入依赖的协作结构，最大化压缩目标。

Result: 在Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen3 8B上，GoA在六个文档问答基准测试中，将检索增强生成的平均F1分数提升5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的强基线提升16.35%。仅用2K上下文窗口即可超越128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过将长上下文建模形式化为压缩问题，显著提升了多智能体系统的性能，实现了有效上下文长度的戏剧性增加。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Motivation: 现有分子基础模型主要依赖SMILES表示，忽略了实验光谱和3D结构信息，这限制了它们在需要立体化学、空间构象和实验验证的关键任务中的有效性。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，明确建模分子光谱，统一实验光谱与分子3D结构信息。

Result: 在光谱相关任务上达到最先进性能，NMR、IR和MS基准测试平均准确率0.53；光谱分析任务中，Spectra-to-SMILES序列准确率15.5%，token准确率41.7%；能够从SMILES或光谱输入直接生成准确的3D分子结构。

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM不仅实现了分子解析任务的强大性能，还直接生成准确的3D分子结构，连接了光谱分析、分子解析和分子设计。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular

Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口扩大，直接输入完整文档成为RAG的替代方案，但这种方法存在token效率低、'迷失在中间'现象和干扰加剧等问题。

Method: 提出LDAR（学习感知干扰的检索），这是一种自适应检索器，学习以减轻干扰段落影响的方式检索上下文。

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强调了在信息覆盖和干扰之间平衡权衡的重要性，LDAR方法在减少token使用的同时实现了显著更高的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

Motivation: 解决仅依赖ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，或仅依赖MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，实现从少量非结构化文本或视觉输入中发现逻辑事实和归纳逻辑规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并在文本到图像定制生成等应用中展示了潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功桥接了ILP和MLLMs，通过结合两者的优势解决了逻辑规则归纳中的关键挑战。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zubov-Net是一个自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引域与预设吸引域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的权衡问题。该方法通过三部分损失函数和并行边界采样算法，主动控制吸引域几何形状，在保持高分类精度的同时显著提升对各种噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经ODE因其动力系统特性在输入扰动下具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法通常需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证。然而，由于难以施加适当的稳定性条件，鲁棒性与准确性之间存在根本性矛盾。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引域与预设吸引域之间的一致性表征。通过三部分损失函数（一致性损失、分类损失和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经ODE和Lyapunov函数。设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络，通过softmax注意力机制关注平衡点相关特征。

Result: 理论上证明了最小化三部分损失可保证预设吸引域-吸引域的一致对齐、轨迹稳定性和非重叠预设吸引域。建立了具有更紧概率界和更少维度要求的随机凸可分性。实验表明Zubov-Net在保持高分类精度的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Zubov-Net通过主动控制吸引域几何形状的新范式，成功调和了神经ODE的准确性和鲁棒性之间的矛盾，为稳定学习提供了理论保证和实际有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RLVR方法具有价值且已具备工业应用条件，但需要保持其实用优势的同时，优先考虑可靠性、安全性和测量准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using

describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Conclusion: IVT作为即插即用框架能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于无样本和有样本场景，与多种初始化策略兼容

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，包含现有引导方法作为特例，并能无缝应用于掩码扩散模型，显著提升了离散数据引导的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

Motivation: GAMs因忽略高阶交互效应而限制预测性能，CESR虽包含全特征交互但性能不佳，需要新模型平衡可解释性和性能

Method: 构建乘法-加法约束模型(MACMs)，包含乘法部分和加法部分，解耦交互项和独立项的系数，扩展假设空间

Result: 基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和最先进的GAMs

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法和加法结构有效提升了模型性能

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解有限训练样本下生成模型的行为提供了理论框架，揭示了模型在不同条件下的生成机制，对生成模型的欠拟合和过拟合问题给出了形式化定义。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves

*O. Duranthon,P. Marion,C. Boyer,B. Loureiro,L. Zdeborová*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析比较了softmax注意力与其他激活函数（如线性注意力）在单位置回归任务中的性能，证明softmax在总体水平上达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型主要使用softmax注意力机制，但其相对于替代方案（如分量式或线性注意力）的优势缺乏理论理解，许多理论研究集中在更易分析的线性化注意力上。

Method: 基于统计物理学思想，在高维极限下分析基于注意力的预测器，其中泛化性能由少量序参量捕获。研究单位置回归任务，分析不同激活函数在总体水平和有限样本情况下的表现。

Result: 在总体水平上，softmax达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本性不足。在有限样本情况下，softmax虽然不再是贝叶斯最优，但仍持续优于线性注意力。

Conclusion: softmax注意力在理论上具有优越性，能够达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本性缺陷。研究还确定了实现最优性能所需的激活函数特性，并讨论了基于梯度算法的优化连接。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出SIHD框架，基于结构信息构建自适应分层扩散模型，用于稀疏奖励的长时程离线强化学习任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层扩散方法通常采用固定的两层结构和单一时间尺度，限制了在不同下游任务中的适应性和决策灵活性

Method: 分析离线轨迹中的结构信息来自适应构建扩散层次结构，使用状态社区的结构信息增益作为扩散层条件信号，引入结构熵正则化器减少对离线数据集的过度依赖

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL任务上，SIHD显著优于现有最优基线方法，在决策性能和跨场景泛化方面表现出色

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次结构和结构信息利用，有效解决了长时程稀疏奖励环境中的离线策略学习问题

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出Active Attacks算法，通过自适应探索生成多样化攻击提示，用于LLM安全微调，显著提升攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于RL的红色团队方法在生成多样化攻击提示时容易陷入局部最优的问题，需要显式的多样性目标来捕获广泛的恶意行为

Method: 引入Active Attacks算法，通过定期对受害LLM进行安全微调来降低已利用区域的奖励，迫使攻击者寻找新的漏洞，形成从易到难的探索课程

Result: Active Attacks显著优于现有RL方法，将对抗GFlowNets的跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%，相对增益超过400倍，计算成本仅增加6%

Conclusion: Active Attacks是一种简单有效的即插即用模块，能够逐步发现广泛的局部攻击模式，实现对多模式分布的广泛覆盖

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用固定的推理深度，导致简单问题过度推理而复杂问题推理不足，需要一种能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度的机制。

Method: 提出奖励函数，将推理长度与模型感知的问题难度动态关联，鼓励简单任务使用简短推理，复杂任务使用深入推理。

Result: 实验表明该方法既有效又高效，同时提升了任务性能并显著减少了平均推理长度。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型音频语言模型提供了智能推理能力，通过自适应推理深度优化了推理效率和质量。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES-蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的丰富多模态信息。

Method: 使用四模态体积对比学习捕获高阶语义对齐，提出自适应模态丢弃动态调节各模态贡献，并整合IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对稳健和可泛化的DTI预测具有显著益处。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了分类器自由引导(CFG)在扩散模型中的采样动态，揭示了CFG在采样过程中分为三个阶段：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但减少多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解CFG对扩散模型采样动态的影响，特别是在多模态条件分布下的作用机制，因为之前的研究局限于单模态条件分布或简化情况。

Method: 分析CFG在多模态条件分布下的采样过程，将其分解为三个连续阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 发现CFG采样过程分为三个阶段：方向偏移阶段（加速向加权均值移动）、模式分离阶段（抑制较弱模式）和集中阶段（减少细粒度变异性）。实验证实早期强引导会侵蚀全局多样性，而晚期强引导会抑制细粒度变化。

Conclusion: 提出了时间变化的引导调度策略，经验证能够同时提高生成质量和多样性，为CFG的优化应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效解决了LLM增强RL中的语义不匹配问题，显著提升了RL代理在复杂环境中的探索效率和决策性能。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，无法可靠地进行主动因果探测，需要开发语义基础的概念表示方法。

Method: 采用双重监督的混合解耦策略，创建语义基础的概念标记，通过直接干预和系统定位来探测模型内部概念与预测之间的因果关系。

Result: 该方法产生的标记具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解耦性能上优于替代方法，支持因果干预和对抗性漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为从相关性解释转向机制性因果探测提供了验证蓝图，能够更深入地理解模型行为。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中数据不足和边稀疏导致的链接预测困难问题

Method: 提出AEGIS边缘增强框架，采用均匀重采样或逆度偏置重采样现有训练边，保持原始节点集不变；使用语义KNN等方法进行增强

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法；在GDP图上，语义KNN实现最大AUC改进和Brier分数降低

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要针对视觉或语言任务，无法有效处理天气下游任务特有的变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化等挑战，导致在天气基础模型上性能不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示(TADP)通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择(SFAS)利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT使用更少的可训练参数实现了与完全微调相当的性能，而现有PEFT方法与完全微调存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一种高效且有效的微调方案，解决了现有方法在天气任务上的局限性，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络在捕捉分子几何方面表现出色，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以有效建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核函数通常系统特定且缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要仔细调整多个参数并增加计算开销。

Method: 提出多阶段聚类全局建模（MCGM），一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过高效聚类操作为几何GNN提供层次化全局上下文。MCGM构建原子聚类的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态层次聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换传播此上下文，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个有效解决几何GNN长程相互作用建模问题的通用解决方案，通过层次化聚类机制显著提升了分子几何预测性能，同时保持了计算效率和参数效率。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，需要改进特征表示质量。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度，强制学习正交特征，计算复杂度随SAE规模线性增长。

Result: OrtSAE发现更多独特特征（+9%），显著减少特征吸收（-65%）和组合（-15%），在虚假相关性移除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务表现与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束能有效改善SAE的特征解耦能力，解决特征吸收和组合问题，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two
artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its
use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further
explorations of latent space.

*Suman Sanyal*

TL;DR: 提出CDP方法，一种无边界线性降维技术，通过构建k-NN图和检测可接受对来保持局部非凸性，并提供可验证的保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维方法往往忽略局部非凸性，CDP旨在保持点云中由绕行引起的局部非凸结构。

Method: 构建k-NN图，识别欧几里得距离与最短路径比率低于阈值的可接受对，聚合归一化方向形成半正定非凸结构矩阵，使用前k个特征向量进行投影。

Result: 提供两种可验证保证：成对后验证书和平均情况谱界，评估协议报告固定和重选对的绕行误差及证书分位数。

Conclusion: CDP是一种有效的边界自由降维方法，能够保持局部非凸性并提供可验证的质量保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

TL;DR: MO-GRPO是对GRPO的扩展，通过简单的归一化方法自动根据奖励函数值的方差重新加权，解决了多目标设置中GRPO容易出现的奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在准确奖励模型可用时表现良好，但在许多实际任务中缺乏高度可靠的奖励模型。特别是在多目标设置中，GRPO容易优化其中一个目标而牺牲其他目标，即奖励黑客问题。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO，扩展GRPO算法，采用归一化方法自动根据奖励函数值的方差重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数的贡献均匀，同时保持偏好顺序。

Result: 在四个领域进行了实验评估：(i)多臂老虎机问题，(ii)模拟控制任务，(iii)WMT基准上的机器翻译任务，(iv)指令跟随任务。MO-GRPO通过均匀分布奖励组件之间的相关性实现了稳定学习，性能优于GRPO。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，无需手动调整奖励函数尺度，能够稳定学习并平衡各目标。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

TL;DR: BrainPro是一个大型EEG基础模型，通过检索式空间学习模块和脑状态解耦模块，解决了现有模型在捕捉通道间交互和学习状态感知表示方面的不足，在多个BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能显式捕捉通道间和脑区间的交互信息，且受限于不同数据集的电极配置差异。同时，当前模型在自监督预训练中很少学习状态感知表示，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习模块（灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和脑区交互）和脑状态解耦模块（通过并行编码器和解耦损失实现状态感知表示学习）。

Result: 在9个公开BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能，展现了强大的泛化能力，能够无缝适应不同任务和硬件设置。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，显著提升了EEG基础模型的性能和泛化能力，为脑机接口和医疗应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: 提出在教师模型训练中引入类内对比损失，通过整合边界损失来解决训练不稳定问题，丰富软标签中的类内多样性信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法中教师模型主要遵循真实标签作为目标，未考虑同一类别内的多样化表示，限制了学生模型的泛化能力

Method: 在教师训练中引入类内对比损失，并整合边界损失来改善训练稳定性和收敛速度，理论分析了该损失对类内和类间距离的影响

Result: 实验结果表明所提方法有效，类内对比损失能够丰富类内多样性

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过增强软标签中的类内信息，提高了知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在迁移学习中，当只从上游模型迁移部分参数到下游模型时，缺乏对这种部分参数重用的有益条件及其有效性影响因素的理论理解。

Method: 在ReLU卷积神经网络的理论框架下，分析参数迁移机制，并通过数值实验和真实数据实验进行实证验证。

Result: 研究揭示了继承参数如何作为通用知识载体，并识别了增强其对目标任务有益影响的关键因素，同时解释了参数迁移在某些情况下可能导致测试精度下降的原因。

Conclusion: 本文为参数迁移提供了理论分析框架，阐明了部分参数重用的有效条件，并通过实验验证了理论发现，为迁移学习实践提供了指导。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 激活引导技术通过向LLM隐藏状态添加语义向量来控制模型行为，但研究发现这种方法会系统性破坏模型的安全防护，使其更容易响应有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活引导技术是否真的如宣称的那样是精确、可解释且安全的替代微调方法，还是实际上会破坏模型的安全对齐。

Method: 在不同模型系列上进行广泛实验，测试随机方向引导和基于稀疏自编码器的良性特征引导对有害请求合规率的影响，并构建通用攻击向量。

Result: 随机方向引导可将有害合规率从0%提升至2-27%；稀疏自编码器引导进一步增加2-4%；20个随机向量组合可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未见请求的有害合规率。

Conclusion: 精确控制模型内部状态并不能保证精确控制模型行为，这对通过可解释性实现安全的范式提出了挑战。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出NL-SME方法，通过非线性参数轨迹建模显著提升了联邦学习中梯度反转攻击的效果，相比线性假设方法有数量级改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理模型的梯度反转攻击方法假设线性参数轨迹，严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 提出非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特性，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，余弦相似度损失有数量级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私脆弱性，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range

challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency
and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting
the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.
Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型更新的鲁棒性，但忽视了补救建议的时间动态特性，特别是在竞争性资源受限环境中，建议会改变未来申请者群体

Method: 引入基于强化学习的补救算法，显式建模候选人群对建议的适应性反应，生成在预定时间范围内保持有效的可行建议

Conclusion: 将时间和行为动态纳入实际补救系统设计中至关重要，该框架为在动态环境中提供持久有效的补救建议提供了新思路

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为体育心理特征分析提供了可解释、数据驱动的框架，可用于运动员发展的决策支持。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

Method: 提出了一种悲观双层优化程序，专门针对回归场景设计，不要求对手策略的凸性或唯一性假设，能够捕捉对手的对抗性本质。

Result: 该方法理论上能够增强回归模型在对抗性规避攻击下的鲁棒性，特别是在垃圾邮件过滤、恶意软件检测和假图像生成等安全应用中。

Conclusion: 悲观双层优化框架可以成功扩展到回归问题，为构建更安全的机器学习系统提供了新的理论工具，特别是在需要持续更新安全措施以应对不断进化的恶意数据的场景中。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无critic方法如GRPO虽然内存需求低，但由于缺乏关键学习信号且包含大量无信息样本和token，导致收敛缓慢。

Method: D$^3$S框架包含两个层次：样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts，token级选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的tokens，并采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D$^3$S集成到先进RL算法中实现了最先进的性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D$^3$S通过优先处理信息量最大的样本和token，有效解决了无critic方法收敛慢的问题，在多个推理基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，分别采用不同的编码策略来处理缺失值和时序模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀的间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL区分生命体征和实验室测试两种临床变量：生命体征被重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕捉时序上下文并通过显式编码推理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL框架有效解决了电子健康记录中不规则采样时间序列的建模挑战，特别适用于现实临床场景中关键变量经常不可用的情况。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出了双切片Wasserstein（DSW）距离作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein（WoW）距离的稳定高效替代方案，通过利用1维Wasserstein空间与分位数函数空间的等距性，避免了高阶矩的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖参数化元测度或高阶矩存在性，导致数值不稳定。需要一种更稳定且计算高效的WoW距离替代方案。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与L2([0,1])空间中分位数函数的等距性，引入基于任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架，通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测度的切片距离。

Result: DSW在离散化元测度下与WoW最小化等价，同时避免了不稳定高阶矩问题并实现计算节省。在数据集、形状和图像上的数值实验验证了DSW作为WoW距离可扩展替代的有效性。

Conclusion: DSW提供了一个稳定、可扩展的WoW距离替代方案，在保持理论等价性的同时显著改善了数值稳定性和计算效率。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了LLM中N:M激活剪枝方法，发现相比权重剪枝，激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下能更好地保持生成能力，并推荐8:16模式作为硬件友好的最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型推理需求增长，稀疏化技术备受关注。虽然半结构化(N:M)权重剪枝已有研究，但激活剪枝的应用仍较少探索，尽管它具有动态、输入自适应压缩和减少I/O开销的潜力。

Method: 提出了训练后N:M激活剪枝的全面分析方法，评估了轻量级即插即用错误缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立了硬件友好的基线方法，探索了包括16:32在内的多种稀疏模式。

Result: 在多个LLM上的实验表明，激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力。16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏，但考虑到灵活性和硬件实现复杂度的权衡，8:16模式被确定为更优选择。

Conclusion: 研究提供了有效的激活剪枝实践方法，并激励未来硬件支持更灵活的稀疏模式。8:16稀疏模式在性能和硬件友好性之间取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一个用于多智能体网络信息聚合的新框架，通过动态分配权重来加速去中心化学习，在数据异构场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构性，需要更智能的聚合方案。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT基于邻居服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先选择具有多样化信息的服务器，而不是使用传统的静态权重（如Metropolis权重）。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT在不同服务器数量和图拓扑结构下都能显著提高训练速度，且通信和内存开销最小。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种聚合方案，与任何底层服务器级优化算法兼容，具有广泛的适用性和集成潜力。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: 该方法为学习群等变函数提供了一种有效框架，能够自动发现对称性并构建简化高效的模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的情况下实现解耦表示可识别性的条件，为解耦表示理论提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Motivation: 解决多路数据（特别是动态图流）中缺失值填补问题，需要既能保持参数效率又能灵活融入图结构先验的方法。

Method: 采用核回归框架，通过固定张量秩的张量分解实现参数效率，使用Hadamard过参数化促进稀疏性，在黎曼流形上求解光滑逆问题。

Result: 在真实世界图数据集上的数值测试表明，KReTTaH在填补缺失的时间变化边流方面持续优于现有最先进方法，包括非参数张量方法和神经网络方法。

Conclusion: KReTTaH提供了一个有效且灵活的多路数据填补框架，特别适用于动态图流估计，能够无缝融入图结构先验知识。

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型的数据记忆能力，从数据重建角度分析参数数量与数据重建之间的关系。

Method: 使用随机特征模型分析，提出基于特征空间中训练样本子空间的优化方法来重建输入数据。

Result: 在随机特征、全连接和残差网络等多种架构上验证了当p > dn时能够成功重建训练数据。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建定律：当参数数量超过dn阈值时，可以从模型参数中完全恢复训练数据集。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等广泛应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群结构的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式定义SO(n)的李代数，建立轨道在Hγ作用下的规范形式，并推导Hγ-不变函数的标准化表示，通过学习参数发现底层单参数子群。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中，成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称性感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效发现SO(n)的单参数子群，在各种应用中产生可解释的对称性感知表示，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Conclusion: 该框架为不同问题设置提供了应用指南，能够在保持性能的同时实现更好的公平性平衡。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

Motivation: 现有形式化语句相似性评估方法无法平衡语义和结构信息，字符串方法忽略语义，证明方法缺乏分级相似度评分。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架有效整合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似性评估提供了连续评分，在EPLA基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spectral Uncertainty的新方法，利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵来量化和分解大语言模型中的不确定性，将总不确定性区分为固有的数据模糊性（偶然不确定性）和模型局限性（认知不确定性）。


<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多样化应用中的集成，获取可靠的预测不确定性度量变得至关重要。需要精确区分来自输入数据固有模糊性的偶然不确定性和仅来自模型局限性的认知不确定性，以有效处理每种不确定性来源。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty方法为LLMs的不确定性量化和分解提供了有效的解决方案，在区分不同类型不确定性方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了PatchMoE，一种基于MoE架构的时间序列分析框架，通过任务感知的路由机制和时空相关性建模，在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE架构在NLP中表现出色，但在时间序列分析中由于任务无关的路由器和缺乏通道相关性建模能力，难以适应多样化的任务需求。

Method: 提出PatchMoE框架，采用循环噪声门控机制利用层次信息进行路由，实现任务特定能力；在时间和通道维度上操作路由策略，并通过精心设计的时空负载均衡损失来建模复杂的时空相关性。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的综合实验表明，PatchMoE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PatchMoE通过任务感知的路由和时空相关性建模，为时间序列分析提供了一个强大而通用的MoE框架。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器模型为无线语义通信提供了有效的解决方案，能够更好地学习信号分布，在多用户场景下也表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

*Yingying Li,Mingxuan Xie,Hailong You,Yongqiang Yao,Hongwei Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标非凸约束松弛模型的高效超图划分框架，采用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成多样化顶点特征，结合MST策略处理不同规模数据，并通过精炼策略提升划分质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图划分方法容易陷入局部最优，划分质量有待提升，特别是在处理大规模数据和加权顶点集时表现不足。

Method: 使用多目标非凸约束松弛模型和加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征；针对不同数据规模采用两种MST策略：小规模数据使用Prim算法构建最小生成树后剪枝聚类，大规模数据选择代表性节点构建较小MST；引入贪心迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等精炼策略。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，相比KaHyPar在2、3、4路划分中平均减少2%-5%的割集规模，特定实例提升达35%；在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart等先进划分器；精炼策略可将hMetis划分结果提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分质量上具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现优异，验证了其竞争力和性能权衡特性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文基于Kolmogorov复杂度理论，为Transformer等神经网络引入了渐近最优描述长度目标的理论框架，证明了该目标能实现最优压缩，并构建了可微分的变分目标，但标准优化器难以找到此类解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小描述长度(MDL)原则在机器学习中应用奥卡姆剃刀，但神经网络缺乏原则性的模型复杂度度量方法，限制了MDL在Transformer等网络中的应用。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov复杂度理论建立渐近最优描述长度目标的理论框架，证明Transformer存在此类目标，并构建基于自适应高斯混合先验的可微分变分目标。

Result: 理论证明渐近最优目标存在且能实现最优压缩，实验显示变分目标能选择低复杂度解并具有强泛化能力，但标准优化器难以找到此类解。

Conclusion: 为识别具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标提供了理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aurora是一个多模态时间序列基础模型，支持多模态输入和零样本推理，通过模态引导的自注意力机制和原型引导的流匹配方法，在跨域时间序列预测中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测中的跨域泛化问题，现有单模态基础模型无法充分利用文本等模态中的领域特定知识，而端到端多模态监督模型不支持零样本推理。

Method: 通过标记化、编码和蒸馏提取多模态领域知识，使用模态引导的多头自注意力机制将知识注入时间表示建模，在解码阶段采用原型引导的流匹配进行生成式概率预测。

Result: 在TimeMMD、TSFM-Bench和ProbTS等基准测试中，Aurora在单模态和多模态场景下均实现了持续的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效利用多模态领域知识，显著提升了时间序列预测的跨域泛化能力，支持零样本推理，为多模态时间序列分析提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Motivation: 高阶数值方法虽然提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题，传统蒸馏技术可能损害这些模型的性能。

Method: 使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶数值方法，提出IIET架构；引入IIAD蒸馏技术，通过灵活阈值平衡性能与效率。

Conclusion: IIET通过迭代隐式欧拉方法有效解决了高阶数值Transformer的效率问题，结合IIAD蒸馏技术实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家剪枝和高效二阶信息计算，实现了MoE模型的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存和计算需求。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

TL;DR: 提出了EPO框架来解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中LLM智能体的探索-利用级联失败问题，通过熵正则化、熵平滑正则器和自适应相位加权机制，显著提升了ScienceWorld和ALFWorld任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多轮稀疏奖励环境中训练LLM智能体面临独特挑战：早期策略过早收敛和后期策略崩溃，导致探索-利用级联失败，传统熵正则化方法在此设置下效果不佳。

Method: EPO框架包含三个协同机制：(1) 多轮设置中的熵正则化增强探索；(2) 熵平滑正则器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内；(3) 自适应相位加权平衡训练过程中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现了高达152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现了19.8%的性能提升，证明了在多轮稀疏奖励环境中需要与传统RL不同的熵控制方法。

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要根本不同于传统RL的熵控制方法，EPO框架通过系统性的熵管理机制有效解决了探索-利用级联失败问题，对LLM智能体训练具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

Motivation: 解决强化学习在任务不匹配情况下先验知识效用下降的问题，特别是在分布外设置中的适应挑战

Method: APB方法在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，同时保留先验知识

Result: APB相比标准RL提升了样本效率，在现有元RL基线失败的OOD任务中表现出良好的适应能力

Conclusion: APB通过参数高效微调机制有效解决了强化学习在任务不匹配和OOD环境中的适应问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

Motivation: 深度学习模型变得越来越大和复杂，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟显著上升，这在需要频繁加载和卸载模型的移动和延迟敏感环境中成为重大挑战。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持了有竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐步提升准确率，最终达到完整教师模型的准确率而不影响初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在响应性和性能都至关重要的环境中表现出色，有效解决了知识蒸馏中性能与效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

TL;DR: 本文提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)技术，通过自蒸馏方法让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式，从而在数据稀缺情况下提高模型准确性和校准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺情况下比SFT具有更好的泛化能力和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)技术，这是一种自蒸馏方法，旨在让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式，激励类似ICL的内部推理过程。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，在SFT之前执行IA2作为预训练步骤显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准度。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实际应用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口，表明ICL和SFT通过不同的功能机制实现适应。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现深度神经网络在持续学习中会出现塑性损失问题，这源于Hessian谱崩溃导致梯度下降失效。作者提出了τ-可训练性概念，并通过保持高有效特征秩和L2正则化来有效保持网络塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在持续学习中为何会出现塑性损失，即无法学习新任务而需要重新初始化参数的问题。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，分析Hessian谱崩溃现象，提出基于Kronecker因子化Hessian近似的两种正则化方法：保持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验表明，结合这两种正则化器能有效保持网络塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是塑性损失的关键原因，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效维持深度神经网络在持续学习中的可塑性。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurvDiff是一个专门为生存分析设计的端到端扩散模型，能够联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失数据，通过生存定制的损失函数确保生成数据的分布保真度和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存数据通常包含不完整的事件信息（如删失数据），这对合成数据生成提出了独特挑战，需要同时忠实再现事件时间分布和删失机制。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存定制的损失函数联合生成协变量、事件时间和删失指示，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SurvDiff在分布保真度和下游评估指标方面始终优于最先进的生成基线方法。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个专门为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够有效再现真实的事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态世界模型在面对新颖或罕见配置时表现不佳，需要研究能够自我适应的世界模型。

Method: 形式化了上下文环境学习，识别了两个核心机制（环境识别和环境学习），推导了误差上界，并通过实证验证了ICL机制的存在。

Result: 实证确认了世界模型中存在不同的ICL机制，并发现数据分布和模型架构以与理论一致的方式影响ICL。

Conclusion: 这些发现展示了自我适应世界模型的潜力，并突出了ICEL出现的关键因素，特别是长上下文和多样化环境的必要性。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出随机激活函数策略，在LLM前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的优化问题，并在预训练和生成任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度消失的问题，同时探索在生成任务中增加文本多样性的方法。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用随机激活（Bernoulli选择SILU或RELU），微调时固定使用RELU以获得稀疏潜在向量；在生成任务中直接使用随机激活策略。

Result: 预训练+微调方案比直接使用RELU训练效果更好，推理时CPU速度显著提升；生成任务中性能略低于SILU+温度缩放，但提供了增加文本多样性的可控方式。

Conclusion: 随机激活函数是解决RELU优化问题的有效策略，同时为文本生成提供了新的多样性控制方法。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在多个领域取得了经验性成功，但对神经特征表示的理解仍不完整，需要从几何角度深入分析特征表示的演化过程。

Method: 使用几何图来近似输入数据流形，通过理论分析和实验验证，研究了20,000多个前馈神经网络在二分类任务中的特征几何演化。

Result: 发现非线性激活对特征几何形成至关重要，特征几何演化类似于离散Ricci流，类别可分性的出现对应于图中社区结构的形成。

Conclusion: 提出了基于几何变换评估的新框架，并推导出实用的设计原则，包括几何启发的早停启发式和网络深度选择标准。

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型音频语言模型（LALMs）中思维链（CoT）的忠实性问题，通过多种干预方法在SAKURA和MMAR数据集上进行实验，发现LALMs产生的CoT通常忠实于其决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型音频语言模型中思维链的忠实性，这在安全敏感应用中至关重要，且音频推理比文本推理更具挑战性，因为模型需要先从音频中提取相关线索再进行推理。

Method: 应用多种针对性干预方法，包括释义、填充标记注入、提前回答和引入错误，在两个具有挑战性的推理数据集SAKURA和MMAR上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，经过多种干预后，LALMs产生的思维链通常忠实于其底层决策过程。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，大型音频语言模型产生的思维链在多个数据集和任务中表现出良好的忠实性。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中多模态检测的挑战，允许客户端在推理时使用任意训练好的模态头，同时保护隐私并提高系统灵活性。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出角色感知桶聚合，受MoE和FedMM启发，使用硬门控选择模态专家，分别聚合模态特定参数以避免跨嵌入冲突。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；WebPhish数据集达到96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家机制能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提升多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在信用风险评估中面临高维数据、有限可解释性、罕见事件检测和多类别不平衡等挑战，需要更稳健的模型来改进信用风险管理和金融决策。

Method: 采用元学习框架，整合监督学习算法（XGBoost、随机森林、SVM、决策树）、无监督方法（K-近邻）、深度学习架构（多层感知机）、LASSO正则化进行特征选择，以及纠错输出码作为元分类器处理不平衡多类别问题，并使用排列特征重要性分析增强模型透明度。

Result: 在包含2,029家美国上市公司信用评分的企业信用评分数据集上进行实证验证，结果表明该元学习框架显著提高了信用评级迁移（升级和降级）和违约概率估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过解决信用风险建模中的三个基本挑战，为开发更准确可靠的金融决策支持计算模型做出了贡献，提供了更全面的信用风险评估方法。

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在实际AI应用中广泛使用，但其内部结构和复杂性使其通常难以解释。模型透明度和可解释性是许多场景的关键要求，仅凭高性能不足以采用所提出的解决方案。

Method: 将可微L0正则化近似应用于基于逻辑的神经网络MLLP，研究其在减少离散可解释版本CRS复杂度同时保持性能的效果。与随机二值化等替代启发式方法进行比较。

Result: 讨论了CRS复杂度与其性能之间的权衡关系，比较了基于损失函数稀疏化网络与基于随机分布的方法的效果差异。

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机方法可以获得更好的结果，在保持性能的同时有效降低模型复杂度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

Motivation: CFR算法在多人游戏中计算复杂度指数级增长，且纳什均衡无法保证非负结果，限制了其在锦标赛等流行格式中的应用。受LLM在象棋和外交游戏中的成功启发，研究LLM在多人不完全信息游戏中的潜力。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高注额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。

Result: SpinGPT在78%的决策中与求解器一致（容忍准确率），使用简单深筹码启发式方法，在3万手牌中对战Slumbot获得13.4±12.9 BB/100的表现（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: LLM可能是处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务上的实验表明，ReLAM显著加速学习过程并达到优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励，有效解决了视觉强化学习中奖励设计的挑战，为机器人操作任务提供了高效的学习框架。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个结合移动基础模型和大型语言模型的新框架，通过语义增强位置编码、渐进式课程学习和交互式自反机制，解决地理坐标与语言词汇不匹配的问题，显著提升了人类移动轨迹生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动基础模型在数据规模和语义理解上存在瓶颈，而大型语言模型虽然具备强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解，无法生成物理上合理的移动轨迹。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：语义增强位置编码来弥合地理与语言之间的差距，渐进式课程学习使LLM推理与移动模式对齐，交互式自反机制用于条件轨迹生成。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoveFM-R显著优于现有的MFM和LLM基线方法，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFM的统计能力与LLM的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模新范式。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

*Anastasiia Filippova,Angelos Katharopoulos,David Grangier,Ronan Collobert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种内存和计算效率高的低通信分布式训练方法，通过限制反向传播只更新固定参数子集来减少通信开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法通过减少全局同步频率来降低通信成本，但其效率仍有提升空间，特别是在内存使用和计算量方面

Method: 在本地更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结，同时保持完整前向传播以避免跨节点激活交换

Result: 在32节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下与现有方法达到相近的困惑度，同时减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存使用

Conclusion: 通过限制反向传播的参数更新范围，可以在保持模型性能的同时显著提升分布式训练的内存和计算效率

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

*Yuma Fujimoto,Kenshi Abe,Kaito Ariu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究解决了博弈学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过调整乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响，在乐观权重大于时间延迟时能实现常数遗憾和策略收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略会导致优化差异，通常使用OFTRL算法预测未来奖励来克服这种差异，但过去奖励的观测时间延迟会阻碍预测效果。

Method: 提出加权OFTRL算法，将OFTRL中下一个奖励的预测向量加权n倍，通过乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 证明当乐观权重大于时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式博弈中实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略收敛到纳什均衡。

Conclusion: WOFTRL算法能有效解决博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，理论分析和实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Flood复形用于大规模欧几里得点云数据的持久同调计算，解决了Vietoris-Rips复形计算复杂度高的问题，能够在数百万个点上高效计算PH，并在物体分类任务中优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持久同调计算方法如Vietoris-Rips复形在大规模点云数据上面临计算复杂度指数增长的严重限制，即使Alpha复形或稀疏Rips近似等方法仍然会产生过多的单纯形，阻碍了在大规模点云上的应用。

Method: 引入Flood复形，受Alpha复形和Witness复形启发。在给定过滤值r下，Flood复形包含点云小子集Delaunay三角剖分中所有被半径为r的球完全覆盖的单纯形，这个过程称为"淹没"。该方法支持GPU并行化。

Result: 在3D点云数据上的扩展实验表明，可以在数百万个点上计算到维度2的持久同调。在真实世界和合成数据的物体分类任务中，该方法性能优于其他基于PH的方法和点云数据的神经网络，特别是对于几何或拓扑复杂的对象。

Conclusion: Flood复形为大规模点云数据的持久同调计算提供了高效的解决方案，其扩展能力对于处理几何或拓扑复杂的对象至关重要，在物体分类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Motivation: 神经ODE在训练中面临梯度计算精度和收敛分析的挑战，需要研究激活函数特性如何影响这些训练动态。

Method: 通过理论分析激活函数的平滑性和非线性特性，结合数值实验验证理论发现。

Result: 平滑激活函数保证ODE解的唯一性，非线性维持NTK谱特性，在过参数化情况下实现梯度下降的全局收敛。

Conclusion: 激活函数的平滑性和非线性是神经ODE成功训练的关键，为实际应用中的扩展提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为逆泊松流匹配（IPFM）的新蒸馏框架，用于加速静电生成模型（如PFGM++）的采样过程，通过将蒸馏问题重新表述为逆问题来实现高效的知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静电生成模型如PFGM++在图像合成方面表现出色，但依赖昂贵的ODE模拟进行采样，计算成本高昂。需要开发高效的蒸馏方法来加速这些模型。

Method: IPFM将蒸馏重新表述为逆问题：学习一个生成器，使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配。该方法推导了可处理的训练目标，并在D→∞时恢复为分数恒等蒸馏（SiD）。

Result: IPFM产生的蒸馏生成器仅需少量函数评估即可达到接近教师甚至更优的样本质量。实验表明，有限D值的蒸馏收敛速度比D→∞（扩散模型）时更快。

Conclusion: IPFM为静电生成模型提供了一种有效的蒸馏框架，显著加速了采样过程，同时保持了样本质量，且有限D值的模型在优化和采样方面具有更有利的特性。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

TL;DR: PIGNN-Attn-LS结合边缘感知注意力机制和回溯线搜索全局校正算子，显著提升了物理信息图神经网络在AC潮流计算中的精度和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)在精度上仍需改进，特别是在推理时物理损失失效的问题阻碍了其在电力系统运行中的实际应用

Method: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS方法，包含边缘感知注意力机制（通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性）和基于回溯线搜索的全局校正算子（在推理时恢复有效的下降准则）

Result: 在4-32总线电网测试中，电压和角度的测试RMSE分别达到0.00033 p.u.和0.08°，比PIGNN-MLP基线分别提升99.5%和87.1%；在4-1024总线电网上，批量推理速度比牛顿-拉夫逊法快2-5倍

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合物理感知的注意力机制和全局校正算子，显著提升了AC潮流计算的精度和效率，为电力系统运行提供了可靠的快速求解器

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Motivation: 传统全空间优化方法会暴露神经网络的中间变量和约束给优化求解器，导致求解效率较低，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用简化空间公式化方法，将神经网络视为灰盒，只暴露输出和导数给优化求解器，中间变量和约束不暴露。

Result: 在对抗性生成和电力系统优化两个问题上验证，相比全空间方法，简化空间方法能获得更快的求解速度和更少的迭代次数。

Conclusion: 简化空间方法为优化神经网络提供了更高效的途径，特别适用于需要GPU加速计算的场景。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法依赖手工增强或复杂生成目标，且主要使用2D拓扑结构，未能充分利用有价值的3D结构信息

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-nets作为建模单元，通过预测子图嵌入与其互补邻域的关系来学习表示，结合2D图和3D构象集合，采用混合GNN-Transformer架构

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，在MoleculeNet上超越对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法，达到最先进结果

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示能够有效迁移到新的化学领域，证明了3D结构信息对分子表示学习的重要性

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示，在科学领域受到广泛关注。但基于核的Koopman算法存在两个普遍问题：计算复杂度高（稀疏性问题）和超参数优化困难。

Method: 将Koopman算子理论与再生核希尔伯特空间概念结合，并引入高斯过程方法，统一了高斯过程回归和动态模态分解。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

Conclusion: OFMU框架通过明确的优先级和梯度解相关，有效解决了机器遗忘中的多目标冲突问题，为大规模模型的安全部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH

*Guillem Capellera,Luis Ferraz,Antonio Rubio,Alexandre Alahi,Antonio Agudo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JointDiff是一个新颖的扩散框架，能够同时生成连续时空数据和同步离散事件，填补了生成模型中连续数据和离散事件分离的建模空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型通常将连续数据和离散事件视为独立过程，这限制了在复杂系统中建模它们同步交互的能力。

Method: 提出JointDiff扩散框架，通过CrossGuid条件操作实现多智能体领域的有效条件控制，支持弱拥有者引导和文本引导两种可控生成场景。

Result: 在体育领域验证了该框架的有效性，实现了最先进的性能，并创建了包含文本描述的统一样准数据集。

Conclusion: 联合建模对于构建真实且可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏相应容量的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。需要开发能够有效泛化到不同任务和数据集的新范式。

Method: 提出ECHO解码器中心范式，将EEG建模重构为序列到序列学习，在序列空间中捕捉信号、标签和任务的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本构建上下文线索，支持上下文学习能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务大型EEG模型，展现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心的序列到序列学习范式，成功解决了现有大型EEG模型解码能力不足的问题，实现了无需参数更新的动态任务适应，在多个任务上表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于图卷积网络(GCN)的捆绑定价解决方案，通过图表示混合捆绑模型，训练GCN学习最优捆绑模式，结合推理策略和局部搜索技术，在计算效率下获得高质量解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捆绑定价是收益管理中的经典问题，但由于候选捆绑数量呈指数级增长，通常难以求解。本文探索使用GCN来解决这一计算难题。

Method: 首先开发混合捆绑模型的图表示，训练GCN学习最优捆绑的潜在模式，提出两种推理策略推导可行解，并使用局部搜索技术提升解质量。

Result: 在5产品实例上训练的GCN，对中小规模问题能获得接近最优解(优于97%)且计算时间大幅减少；对更大规模问题优于其他启发式方法如BSP；对30+产品及非可加效用案例也能提供高质量解。

Conclusion: GCN框架在捆绑定价问题中表现出色，能高效处理传统方法难以解决的大规模复杂实例，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

*Lute Lillo,Nick Cheney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究表明激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的关键因素，提出了两种新的非线性激活函数，并在监督学习和强化学习环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐丧失适应能力（可塑性损失）。现有研究对激活函数在这一失败模式中的作用探索不足，需要深入分析激活函数对持续学习可塑性的影响。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性级分析，引入了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），并在监督类增量基准和强化学习非平稳环境中进行评估。

Result: 研究证明，经过深思熟虑的激活函数设计能够在不增加额外容量或任务特定调优的情况下，为持续学习提供轻量级、领域通用的可塑性维持方法。

Conclusion: 激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的主要架构无关杠杆，适当的激活函数设计能够有效维持模型在持续学习环境中的适应能力。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无监督方法，通过将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间来解决深度强化学习的样本效率问题，并在连续控制领域验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，主要原因是直接在高度冗余的高维参数空间中优化策略，这在多任务设置中问题更加严重。

Method: 训练生成模型将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，通过行为重构损失确保潜在空间按功能相似性而非参数邻近性组织。

Result: 标准策略网络的参数化可以压缩高达五个数量级，同时保留大部分表达能力，学习的流形支持在潜在空间中进行策略梯度任务特定适应。

Conclusion: 策略参数空间的内在维度取决于环境复杂性而非网络大小，压缩潜在空间方法能显著提高样本效率并支持多任务学习。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效区分构造地震和采矿诱发地震，为地震监测系统提供了快速准确的事件分类能力。

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地评估类增量学习的性能分布，解决传统采样方法低估性能方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIL评估协议仅从少量随机序列计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能范围，导致均值估计偏差和方差严重低估。

Method: 提出EDGE协议，利用任务间相似性与模型性能的正相关性，自适应识别和采样极端类别序列，近似真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，提供更准确的分布边界估计，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列评估提供了更可靠的CIL性能分布表征，解决了传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EDGE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合最优传输采样策略的Mean Flow框架，用于改进单步生成模型，在保持原始多步流匹配过程保真度和多样性的同时实现快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流匹配生成模型虽然性能优异，但推理速度慢，需要多步采样。Mean Flow虽然能实现单步生成，但在许多连续域中无法准确近似原始多步流匹配过程的行为。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，使单步生成器能更好地保持原始多步流过程的保真度和多样性。

Result: 在低维控制设置和高维任务（如图像生成、图像到图像转换、点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优传输策略，本文提出的方法在保持快速单步推理的同时，显著提升了生成质量，为流匹配生成模型的实际应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过使用分位数基线替代均值基线，解决了RLVR训练中的熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，实现了稳定的熵控制和持续的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值的价值无关RL方法在奖励异常值情况下会不当惩罚负优势样本，导致训练在熵崩溃和熵爆炸之间振荡，需要更稳定的基线设计。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，实现响应级别的两机制门控。

Result: QAE稳定了熵动态，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上对AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023任务实现了持续的pass@1提升。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式）是扩展RLVR的主要机制，QAE通过分位数基线实现了双向熵安全，为强化学习中的LLM推理提供了稳定基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Conclusion: 首次正式证明了训练后的DFM模型生成分布会随着训练集规模增加而收敛到真实数据分布。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够学习接近可采纳的启发式函数，同时为启发式学习的泛化提供了理论保证，特别是在目标依赖启发式方面取得了突破。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: We formulate a weakly-nonlinear exit condition for open ends of acoustic
waveguides without mean flow; to our knowledge this is the first time an
acoustic open end has been analysed outside the linear regime. The resulting
admittance boundary condition, and its weakly-nonlinear counterpart, extends
recent weakly-nonlinear modelling of curved ducts (Jensen & Brambley 2025,
arXiv:2503.11536) to include open ends. We approximate free space by
considering the open-ended duct to be enclosed within a much larger concentric
duct; within the larger duct, the smaller duct exit is modelled as an acoustic
discontinuity. Importantly, the superposition principle is unneeded, allowing
the model to be applied in the nonlinear regime. The exit condition can be
calculated without needing to solve the full problem in either the outer or
inner ducts, making it numerically efficient. The exit condition is validated
in the linear regime by comparison to Wiener-Hopf solutions of the duct end
correction, and a novel nonlinear end correction is proposed; we find that both
non-plane waves and nonlinearity cause the end correction to vary significantly
from Rayleigh's classical 0.6 radii result. A number of numerical illustrations
are then discussed, demonstrating nonlinear effects, sound radiating from
curved ducts, sound radiating from an exponential horn (representative of brass
instrument bells), and the harmonic effects of the open end on in-duct
resonances. The model has potential applications to sound in woodwind and brass
instruments.

Abstract: We propose a numerical method for fluid deformable surfaces governed by
surface Stokes flow and Helfrich bending energy under active growth, aiming to
model shape evolution of the epithelium in developmental processes. To prevent
self-intersections, which commonly arise under large deformations or low
enclosed volume to area ratios, we incorporate the nonlocal tangent-point
energy to penalize non-embedded configurations. The resulting formulation is
discretized using higher order surface finite elements, with a parallelizable
assembly strategy for the nonlocal terms. To tailor mesh quality to the
geometric evolution, we propose a curvature-adaptive mesh redistribution
strategy that improves mesh resolution in regions of high curvature. Numerical
examples include the discocyte-to-stomatocyte transition and the inversion of a
sphere within a spherical confinement. Both demonstrate the robustness of the
method in capturing large deformations, self-avoidance, symmetry-breaking and
growth-induced morphology changes.

simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our
results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid
distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches.
Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution
profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method
for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling
framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various
network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis
of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids.

TL;DR: 研究分散气泡相在强制均匀各向同性湍流中的影响，发现虽然整体系统保持经典Kolmogorov能量级串，但气相表现出显著偏离经典湍流标度律的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深化对多相湍流，特别是气泡携带流中能量传递机制和相间相互作用的理解，为环境、大气和工业流动研究提供基础。

Method: 使用基于格子Boltzmann方法的高分辨率高性能模拟，分析不同气相体积分数下的湍流结构。

Result: 气相在低波数处呈现近乎平坦的谱，在中间尺度呈现k^{-3}标度，表明存在局部爆发模式；液相在高达24%气相体积分数下仍保持经典湍流结构。

Conclusion: 尽管存在分散相，全局能量传递仍接近普适行为，但相间相互作用在小尺度上引入了湍流动力学的修正。

Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dispersed bubble phase on forced homogeneous
and isotropic turbulence using high-resolution high-performance simulations
based on the lattice Boltzmann method. While the classical Kolmogorov energy
cascade is largely preserved when considering the system as a whole, a
phase-specific analysis reveals striking deviations from the classical
turbulence scaling. In particular, the gas phase exhibits significant
departures from Kolmogorov's predictions, whereas the continuous liquid phase
retains a turbulence structure consistent with classical expectations up to 24%
in gas volume fractions. These findings suggest that, despite the presence of a
dispersed phase, the global energy transfer remains close to a universal
behavior. At the same time, phase-specific interactions are shown to introduce
modifications to the turbulent dynamics at small scales. In particular, the
gas-phase exhibits a nearly flat spectrum at low wave numbers followed by a
k^{-3} scaling at intermediate scales pointing to the presence of patterns of
localized bursts uniformly distributed between two finite wavelengths.Our
results aim at deepening the understanding of multiphase turbulence,
particularly in the context of energy transfer mechanisms and phase
interactions in bubble-laden flows. This study provides a framework for future
investigations into the fundamental properties of multiphase turbulence and its
implications for environmental, atmospheric, and industrial flows.

Conclusion: 扩张斜率在控制分离流中的湍流产生和能量重新分布方面起根本作用，渐变扩张由于回流附着在倾斜表面并与自由流斜向冲击，产生持续湍流生产区域

Abstract: We investigate the influence of expansion geometry on the flow field and
turbulence structure in axisymmetric pipe flows through comparative analysis of
abrupt ($90^\circ$) and gradual ($45^\circ$) area expansions with an area ratio
of 2.56 at step-height Reynolds numbers of 25000 and 35000. Utilizing
refractive index-matched stereo Particle Image Velocimetry, we resolve the
three-component velocity fields and extract turbulence statistics with high
spatial fidelity. Both configurations exhibit full flow separation,
recirculation, and shear layer development; however, the gradual expansion
consistently yields elevated turbulence levels, broader shear layers, enhanced
Reynolds stress anisotropy, and stronger out-of-plane fluctuations. In
contrast, the abrupt expansion generates a secondary vortex that disrupts the
return flow, reducing shear layer interaction and turbulent kinetic energy
(TKE) production. The governing mechanism is attributed to the geometry-induced
modulation of the return flow. In the gradual case, the return flow remains
attached to the sloped surface and impinges obliquely on the free-stream,
generating a distributed region of high shear and sustained turbulence
production leading to intensified TKE and anisotropy in the near-expansion
region. The abrupt case confines this interaction, limiting turbulence
generation spatially and structurally. These findings reconcile prior
observations of increased pressure loss in sloped expansions and reveal the
fundamental role of expansion slope in controlling turbulence generation and
energy redistribution in separated flows. The observed trends suggest a
generalizable mechanism relevant to a broader range of expansion angles and
flow conditions.

Motivation: 理解LANS-α模型为何能产生比标准模型更能量充沛的模拟，特别是其能量增强机制一直难以全面理解。

Method: 推导三维稳定分层LANS-α方程的快速准地转极限，分析慢平衡流和主导阶快速波动力学，并进行直接数值模拟。

Result: α参数在控制慢快模态能量分配中起类似Burger数的作用，但能延长波能量寿命；在所有Bu值下都会创建仅涉及快速波的能量通道。

Conclusion: 这些发现统一了LANS-α模型的能量增强特性与其数值刚度问题，为缓解阻碍该模型广泛应用的稳定性问题提供了潜在途径。

Abstract: The Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ (LANS-$\alpha$) model, a
turbulence closure scheme based on energy-conserving modifications to nonlinear
advection, can produce more energetic simulations than standard models, leading
to improved fidelity (e.g., in ocean models). However, comprehensive
understanding of the mechanism driving this energetic enhancement has proven
elusive. To address this gap, we derive the fast quasi-geostrophic limit of the
three-dimensional, stably-stratified LANS-$\alpha$ equations. This provides
both the slow, balanced flow and the leading-order fast wave dynamics. Analysis
of these wave dynamics suggests that an explanation for the energetic
enhancement lies in the dual role of the smoothing parameter itself: increasing
$\alpha$ regularizes the dynamics and simultaneously generates a robust
landscape of wave-wave resonant interactions. Direct numerical simulations show
that $\alpha$ plays an analogous role to that of the Burger number ($Bu$) in
governing the partition of energy between slow and fast modes -- and
consequently, the timescale of geostrophic adjustment -- but with key
differences. Increasing $\alpha$, regardless of the relative strengths of
rotation and stratification, extends the lifetime of wave energy by delaying
the dominance of the slow modes. We find that the creation of an energy pathway
only involving fast waves is a universal outcome of the regularization across
all values of $Bu$, contrasting with a disruption of slow-fast interactions
that is most impactful only in the $Bu=1$ case. These insights unify the
LANS-$\alpha$ model's characteristic energetic enhancement with, in some cases,
its known numerical stiffness, identifying potential pathways to mitigate
stability issues hindering the broader application of LANS-$\alpha$-type
models.

Abstract: Overset grid methods handle complex geometries by overlapping simpler,
geometry-fitted grids to cover the original, more complex domain. However,
ensuring their stability -- particularly at high orders -- remains a practical
and theoretical challenge. In this work, we address this gap by developing a
discrete counterpart to the recent well-posedness analysis of Kopriva, Gassner,
and Nordstr\"om for continuous overset domain initial-boundary-value problems.
To this end, we introduce the novel concept of sub-cell summation-by-parts
(SBP) operators. These discrete derivative operators mimic integration by parts
at a sub-cell level. By exploiting this sub-cell SBP property, we develop
provably conservative and energy-stable overset grid methods, thereby resolving
longstanding stability issues in the field.

Conclusion: 保形提升算子为解决离散de Rham方法的分析挑战提供了有效工具，特别是在处理非协调离散复形的全局积分性质方面。

Abstract: Discrete de Rham (DDR) methods provide non-conforming but compatible
approximations of the continuous de Rham complex on general polytopal meshes.
Owing to the non-conformity, several challenges arise in the analysis of these
methods. In this work, we design conforming liftings on the DDR spaces, that
are right-inverse of the interpolators and can be used to solve some of these
challenges. We illustrate this by tackling the question of the global
integration-by-part formula. By non-conformity of the discrete complex, this
formula involves a residual -- which can be interpreted as a consistency error
on the adjoint of the discrete exterior derivative -- on which we obtain, using
the conforming lifting, an optimal bound in terms of the mesh size. Our
analysis is carried out in the polytopal exterior calculus framework, which
allows for unified proofs for all the spaces and operators in the DDR complex.
Moreover, the liftings are explicitly constructed in finite element spaces on a
simplicial submesh of the underlying polytopal mesh, which gives more control
on the resulting functions (e.g., discrete trace and inverse inequalities).

Conclusion: 基于长球面波函数的核分裂方法比传统高斯分解更高效，DMK算法为处理非均匀点分布的快速求和问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Classical Ewald methods for Coulomb and Stokes interactions rely on
``kernel-splitting," using decompositions based on Gaussians to divide the
resulting potential into a near field and a far field component. Here, we show
that a more efficient splitting for the scalar biharmonic Green's function can
be derived using zeroth-order prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs), which
in turn yields new efficient splittings for the Stokeslet, stresslet, and
elastic kernels, since these Green's tensors can all be derived from the
biharmonic kernel. This benefits all fast summation methods based on kernel
splitting, including FFT-based Ewald summation methods, that are suitable for
uniform point distributions, and DMK-based methods that allow for nonuniform
point distributions. The DMK (dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting) algorithm
we develop here is fast, adaptive, and linear-scaling, both in free space and
in a periodic cube. We demonstrate its performance with numerical examples in
two and three dimensions.

Conclusion: 所提出的CUR过采样算法改进了标准交叉算法的鲁棒性，在非线性矩阵微分方程的低秩建模中表现良好。

Abstract: Certain classes of CUR algorithms, also referred to as cross or
pseudoskeleton algorithms, are widely used for low-rank matrix approximation
when direct access to all matrix entries is costly. Their key advantage lies in
constructing a rank-r approximation by sampling only r columns and r rows of
the target matrix. This property makes them particularly attractive for
reduced-order modeling of nonlinear matrix differential equations, where
nonlinear operations on low-rank matrices can otherwise produce high-rank or
even full-rank intermediates that must subsequently be truncated to rank $r$.
CUR cross algorithms bypass the intermediate step and directly form the
rank-$r$ matrix. However, standard cross algorithms may suffer from loss of
accuracy in some settings, limiting their robustness and broad applicability.
In this work, we propose a cross oversampling algorithm that augments the
intersection with additional sampled columns and rows. We provide an error
analysis demonstrating that the proposed oversampling improves robustness. We
also present an algorithm that adaptively selects the number of oversampling
entries based on efficiently computable indicators. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed CUR algorithm for time integration of several
nonlinear stochastic PDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds.

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了原有技术到更复杂情况，提供了高效的Boltzmann方程求解方案，特别适用于低中等Knudsen数问题。

Abstract: The kinetic Boltzmann equation models gas dynamics over a wide range of
spatial and temporal scales. Simplified versions of the full Boltzmann
collision operator, such as the classical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook and the closely
related Ellipsoidal-Statistical-BGK operators, can dramatically decrease the
computational costs of numerical solving kinetic equations. Classical BGK
yields incorrect transport coefficients (relative to the full Boltzmann
collision operator) at low Knudsen numbers, whereas ES-BGK captures them
correctly. In this work, we develop a finite volume method using a micro-macro
decomposition of the distribution function, which requires a smaller velocity
mesh relative to direct kinetic methods for low and intermediate Knudsen
numbers. The macro portion of the model is a fluid model with a moment closure
provided from the heat flux tensor calculated from the micro portion. The micro
portion is obtained by applying to the original kinetic equation a projector
into the orthogonal complement of the null space of the collision operator -
this projector depends on the macro portion. In particular, we extend the
technique of Bennoune, Lemou, and Mieussens [Uniformly stable schemes for the
Boltzmann equation preserving the compressible Navier-Stokes asymptotics, J.
Comput. Phys. (2008)] to two-space dimensions, the ES-BGK collision operator,
and problems with reflecting wall boundary conditions. As it appears in both
the micro and macro equations, the collision operator is handled via L-stable
implicit time discretizations. At the same time, the remaining transport terms
are computed via kinetic flux vector splitting (for macro) and upwind
differencing (for micro). The resulting scheme is applied to various test cases
in 1D and 2D. The 2D version of the code is parallelized via MPI, and we
present weak and strong scaling studies with varying numbers of processors.

Conclusion: IterativeCUR是一种高效的自适应低秩矩阵近似算法，在计算速度和保持矩阵结构方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: The computation of accurate low-rank matrix approximations is central to
improving the scalability of various techniques in machine learning,
uncertainty quantification, and control. Traditionally, low-rank approximations
are constructed using SVD-based approaches such as truncated SVD or
RandomizedSVD. Although these SVD approaches -- especially RandomizedSVD --
have proven to be very computationally efficient, other low-rank approximation
methods can offer even greater performance. One such approach is the CUR
decomposition, which forms a low-rank approximation using direct row and column
subsets of a matrix. Because CUR uses direct matrix subsets, it is also often
better able to preserve native matrix structures like sparsity or
non-negativity than SVD-based approaches and can facilitate data interpretation
in many contexts. This paper introduces IterativeCUR, which draws on previous
work in randomized numerical linear algebra to build a new algorithm that is
highly competitive compared to prior work: (1) It is adaptive in the sense that
it takes as an input parameter the desired tolerance, rather than an a priori
guess of the numerical rank. (2) It typically runs significantly faster than
both existing CUR algorithms and techniques such as RandomizedSVD, in
particular when these methods are run in an adaptive rank mode. Its asymptotic
complexity is $\mathcal{O}(mn + (m+n)r^2 + r^3)$ for an $m\times n$ matrix of
numerical rank $r$. (3) It relies on a single small sketch from the matrix that
is successively downdated as the algorithm proceeds.
  We demonstrate through extensive experiments that IterativeCUR achieves up to
$4\times$ speed-up over state-of-the-art pivoting-on-sketch approaches with no
loss of accuracy, and up to $40\times$ speed-up over rank-adaptive randomized
SVD approaches.

fast and embarrassingly parallel solver with excellent speedup and scale-up
qualities, which is perfectly suited for parabolic problems with up to six
space dimensions. We describe our new parallel approach and show its superior
parallelization properties for the heat equation, the chemical master equation
and some exemplary stochastic differential equations.

Abstract: The present work proposes a well-balanced finite volume-type numerical method
for the solution of non-conservative hyperbolic partial differential equations
(PDEs) with source terms. The method is characterized, first, by the use of a
recently introduced high-order spatial reconstruction, based on generalized
Riemann problem information from the previous time level. Such reconstruction
is well-balanced up to order three, compact, efficient and easy to implement.
Second, the method incorporates a well-balanced space-time evolution operator,
which allows for well-balanced fully explicit time evolution. The accuracy and
efficiency of the method are assessed on both a scalar problem (Burgers'
equation) and a nonlinear PDE system (hyperbolized one-dimensional blood flow
equations with gravity and friction, and with variable mechanical and
geometrical properties). The well-balanced property is verified by showing that
numerically-determined stationary solutions are preserved up to machine
precision. The order of accuracy in space and time is validated through
empirical convergence rate studies. Additionally, the performance of the method
is assessed on a network of 86 arteries, under both stationary and transient
conditions.

Abstract: The parameterization of closed surfaces typically requires either multiple
charts or a non-planar domain to achieve a seamless global mapping. In this
paper, we propose a numerical framework for the seamless parameterization of
genus-zero and genus-one closed simplicial surfaces onto a unit square domain.
The process begins by slicing the surface with either the shortest-path or the
Reeb graph method. The sliced surface is then mapped onto the unit square using
a globally convergent algorithm that minimizes the weighted variance of
per-triangle area ratios to achieve area preservation. Numerical experiments on
benchmark models demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy and
efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed method enables applications such as
geometry images, producing accurate and high-quality surface reconstructions.

Abstract: This paper provides a general solution for the Kronecker product
decomposition (KPD) of vectors, matrices, and hypermatrices. First, an
algorithm, namely, monic decomposition algorithm (MDA), is reviewed. It
consists of a set of projections from a higher dimension Euclidian space to its
factor-dimension subspaces. It is then proved that the KPD of vectors is
solvable, if and only if, the project mappings provide the required decomposed
vectors. Hence it provides an easily verifiable necessary and sufficient
condition for the KPD of vectors. Then an algorithm is proposed to calculate
the least square error approximated decomposition. Using it finite times a
finite sum (precise) KPD of any vectors can be obtained. Then the swap matrix
is used to make the elements of a matrix re-arranging, and then provides a
method to convert the KPD of matrices to its corresponding KPD of vectors. It
is proved that the KPD of a matrix is solvable, if and only if, the KPD of its
corresponding vector is solvable. In this way, the necessary and sufficient
condition, and the followed algorithms for approximate and finite sum KPDs for
matrices are also obtained. Finally, the permutation matrix is introduced and
used to convert the KPD of any hypermatrix to KPD of its corresponding vector.
Similarly to matrix case, the necessary and sufficient conditions for
solvability and the techniques for vectors and matrices are also applicable for
hypermatrices, though some additional algorithms are necessary. Several
numerical examples are included to demonstrate this universal KPD solving
method.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了连续Galerkin方法和间断Galerkin方法在导数离散化上的等价性，并基于此提出了一种新的后处理方法，能够在不增加计算量的情况下将间断解提升为连续解，且对于k>0的情况收敛阶提高一阶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现连续Galerkin方法和间断Galerkin方法在ODE框架下的内在联系，探索如何利用这种联系改进间断Galerkin方法的近似解质量。

Method: 通过分析两种Galerkin方法的导数离散化过程，证明它们的等价性，并基于此设计了一种元素级后处理方法：在DG近似解上添加（缩放的）k+1阶左Radau多项式乘以区间左边界处近似解的跳跃量。

Result: 后处理后的新近似解是连续的，当k>0时收敛阶达到k+2，比原始DG方法提高一阶；当k=0时收敛阶保持不变。整个过程不需要额外计算。

Conclusion: 成功建立了连续和间断Galerkin方法之间的新联系，并开发了一种高效的后处理技术，显著提升了间断Galerkin方法的精度和连续性。

Abstract: In the framework of ODEs, we uncover a new link between the continuous
Galerkin method (see Math. Comp. (1972), 26 (118 and 120), 415-426 and 881-891)
and the discontinuous Galerkin method (see Mathematical Aspects of Finite
elements in PDEs, (1974), 89-123), namely, that the discretizations of the
derivative by these two methods are the same. A direct consequence of this
result is the construction of a new elementwise post-processing of the
approximate solution provided by the Discontinuous Galerkin method. When the DG
method uses polynomials of degree $k\ge0$, the post-processing consists in
adding, to the DG approximate solution, the (scaled) left-Radau polynomial of
degree $k+1$ multiplied by the jump of the approximate solution at the left
boundary of the interval. No extra computation is required. The resulting new
approximation is continuous and, for $k>0$, converges with order $k+2$, that
is, with one order more than the original discontinuous Galerkin approximation.
For $k=0$, the order remains the same.

### [466] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器的真实性能，通过三种新策略解决监控器性能被提示信息泄露夸大的问题，在欺骗检测案例中发现内容过滤是最有效的缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白盒监控器在检测大语言模型有害行为方面具有优势，但训练和评估这些监控器需要包含目标行为的响应样本，这导致用于引发行为的信息不可避免地泄露到监控器数据中，从而夸大其有效性。

Method: 提出三种评估策略：内容过滤（从输入中移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关标记的分数）和提示蒸馏微调模型（训练模型在不显式提示下表现出欺骗行为）。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤能平滑移除引发信号，使探针AUROC降低30%；分数过滤减少AUROC 15%；微调模型有机体改善监控器评估但性能降低达40%。

Conclusion: 识别了两种泄露形式（引发泄露和推理泄露），内容过滤是最有效的缓解策略，为白盒监控器的真实性能评估提供了系统性框架。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

TL;DR: 提出决策支点概念，通过自我训练管道验证和压缩推理路径，无需真实推理数据即可对齐模型推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模验证链式思维推理轨迹的难题，利用决策支点作为可验证检查点来区分正确和错误推理。

Method: 采用自我训练管道：采样多样推理路径挖掘共享决策支点，使用辅助验证器压缩为支点聚焦的短路径推理，然后用自生成输出进行后训练。

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖真实推理数据或外部指标的情况下有效对齐推理过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候数据科学面临数据源分散、格式异构和技术门槛高的挑战，限制了参与度、减缓了发现速度并降低了科学工作流的可重复性。

Method: 通过构建知识图谱作为统一层来组织数据集、工具和工作流，结合基于生成式AI服务的AI代理，实现自然语言交互、自动化数据访问和简化分析。

Result: 该系统显著降低了参与气候数据科学的技术门槛，使非专业用户能够识别和分析相关数据集，并展示了可扩展的代理化科学工作流。

Conclusion: 该方法为气候数据的民主化访问提供了可行路径，建立了可重复、可扩展的人机协作科学研究框架。

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

TL;DR: 该研究使用脑电图数据和机器学习模型预测消费者行为，比较了传统机器学习模型和图神经网络模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中具有重要意义，脑电图数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集中提取和清理脑电图特征，为图神经网络创建脑连接特征，使用包括集成模型在内的传统机器学习模型和不同架构的图神经网络模型进行比较。

Result: 虽然整体结果没有显示出显著差异，但图神经网络模型在某些传统模型表现不佳的基本标准上通常表现更好。

Conclusion: 脑电图信号分析与机器学习模型相结合可以更深入地理解消费者行为，并为脑电图神经营销领域提供了传统模型与新兴图神经网络模型的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过结合进化搜索和地理空间领域知识来自动设计和优化地理空间算法，在空间插值和不确定性量化任务上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的算法发现框架缺乏领域知识和多步推理能力，难以解决复杂的地理空间问题。地理空间建模对可持续发展和气候变化等全球挑战至关重要。

Method: 采用双层循环结构：内循环使用代码进化器生成和变异候选解，外循环通过智能体控制器评估全局精英，并查询GeoKnowRAG模块（结构化的地理空间知识库）注入地理学理论先验。

Result: 在空间插值和空间不确定性量化两个基准任务上，GeoEvolve自动改进和发现了新算法，将空间插值误差（RMSE）降低了13-21%，不确定性估计性能提升了17%。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，通过整合临床变量和CT影像进行生存分析，在头颈癌数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求增加，准确且可解释的生存分析在肿瘤学中变得愈发重要。

Method: 使用深度学习推断生存相关特征：影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式。风险估计采用透明的Cox回归，将患者分层为不同生存结果的组别。

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX实现了C-index为0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法。

Conclusion: MultiFIX展示了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了语义F1分数，这是一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签与真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标在处理语义相关但非完全相同的预测时将其视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注者分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。

Method: 使用标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，通过两步精度-召回公式实现任意大小标签集的比较，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似标签。

Result: 语义F1分数在合成和真实数据上表现出更好的可解释性和生态效度，能够为语义相关但非相同的标签提供部分信用。

Conclusion: 语义F1分数提供了更公平的评估，认识到类别重叠、标注者分歧以及基于相似预测的下游决策会产生相似结果，适用于各种任务和模态。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 提出了基于GRPO的框架，通过多语言预训练、有限配对数据微调和GRPO优化，在低资源语言中实现高质量TTS，显著优于仅微调方法，并在高资源语言中也表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言TTS系统开发困难的问题，利用更易获取的ASR模型资源，通过强化学习优化TTS模型。

Method: 1) 使用IPA标记训练多语言TTS基础模型；2) 用有限配对数据微调以捕捉目标语言韵律特征；3) 应用GRPO仅使用非配对文本和说话人提示进行优化，由预训练ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估模型提供多目标奖励。

Result: 在低资源语言中生成清晰可懂且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调方法；在高资源语言中也优于DPO等离线对齐方法，在可懂度、说话人相似性和音频质量方面表现更优。

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效提升低资源和高资源语言的TTS性能，为多语言TTS系统开发提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

TL;DR: RoT通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤来构建动态模板，减少推理时的冗余计算，在保持准确性的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理链来提高准确性，但这增加了延迟和成本，因此需要在推理时提高效率。

Method: 提出检索式思维(RoT)方法，将推理步骤组织成思维图，通过检索相关节点和奖励引导的遍历来组装问题特定的模板，指导生成过程。

Result: 在多个模型和推理基准测试中，RoT将输出token减少40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: RoT通过动态模板构建的检索机制，为高效的大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器在遇到新任务时，要么依赖零样本泛化（性能可能较差），要么需要微调（导致灾难性遗忘），需要一种终身学习方法。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策寻求方式将新任务训练求解器的行为与缓冲行为对齐，并为低置信度决策分配更大权重。

Result: 在容量受限车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的实验表明，LLR-BC能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘，保持可塑性，提高零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在新任务出现时持续学习而不遗忘先前知识。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准测试，用于评估智能体在长时程、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，发现现有LLM智能体在这些复杂任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估大多关注短时程、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）往往需要在长时程、部分可观测场景下进行，现有基准测试无法系统评估这些能力。

Method: 通过探索作为统一任务，在三个不同环境中设计长时程发现任务，智能体需要通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400+工具调用；标准配置下也超过3.5万token和60+工具调用。LLM智能体在这些设置中持续表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 智能体在长时程能力上存在显著差距，简单扩展无法解决这些问题。分析发现错误主要源于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

*Junliang Liu,Jingyu Xiao,Wenxin Tang,Wenxuan Wang,Zhixian Wang,Minrui Zhang,Shuanghe Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了WebRSSBench基准测试，用于全面评估多模态大语言模型在网页理解中的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力，包含8个任务和3799个问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力的全面评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含8个任务的基准测试，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本以及结合自动检查和人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估12个MLLM显示，模型在真实布局的组合和跨元素推理方面仍有困难，面对UI和内容扰动时鲁棒性有限，在识别和避免安全关键操作方面过于保守。

Conclusion: WebRSSBench揭示了MLLM在网页理解方面的显著差距，为未来模型开发提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一个基于人类认知循环（思考、对齐、反思）的GUI代理框架，通过应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐和状态反思来提升多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的性能，无需复杂轨迹数据训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前GUI代理面临的三个关键挑战：端到端训练的数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测的高成本以及矛盾指导的风险。

Method: 采用细粒度的应用特定提示检索机制，结合预执行对齐阶段（包含思想-行动一致性检查和行动校正代理）以及后执行状态反思代理，形成完整的认知循环。

Result: 在AndroidWorld上达到75.8%的成功率，在ScreenSpot-V2上达到96.8%的成功率，在两个主要基准测试中建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: D-Artemis框架显著提升了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的能力，无需复杂轨迹数据集训练，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProRe是一个主动奖励系统，通过通用推理器和领域特定评估器主动与环境交互收集额外观察，为GUI智能体提供更准确可验证的奖励，显著提升奖励准确性和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体场景，因为通常无法获取真实轨迹或应用数据库，而基于轨迹的LLM评估方法准确性有限。

Method: 提出ProRe系统，包含通用推理器和领域特定评估器。推理器调度有针对性的状态探测任务，评估器通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察，从而为GUI智能体分配更准确可验证的奖励。

Result: 在超过3000条轨迹上的实验表明，ProRe将奖励准确性和F1分数分别提升高达5.3%和19.4%。与最先进的策略智能体集成后，任务成功率提升高达22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互和状态探测，显著改善了GUI智能体的奖励评估准确性，为训练和评估提供了更可靠的奖励信号。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

*Jaehyun Nam,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Jinwoo Shin,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DS-STAR是一个新颖的数据科学智能体，通过自动数据文件分析、LLM验证步骤和顺序规划机制，解决了LLM在处理异构数据格式和生成分析计划方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务复杂且涉及多源数据探索，但现有LLM在处理异构数据格式和验证分析计划充分性方面存在困难。

Method: 提出三个关键贡献：1)自动数据文件分析模块；2)LLM验证步骤评估分析计划充分性；3)顺序规划机制从简单计划开始迭代优化。

Result: 在DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code三个基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别在处理多文件异构格式的困难任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过迭代优化方法能够可靠地处理涉及多样数据源的复杂分析任务，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

*Ben Abramowitz,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于公理的决策建模框架，揭示了决策-评估悖论，即在决策制定和评估中使用公理时存在的内在矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何用公理（如伦理约束）来建模决策，并探讨在决策制定和评估过程中使用公理时可能出现的结构性问题。

Method: 构建了一个基于公理的决策建模框架，定义了基于结构特性的决策公理分类法，并分析了决策公理在制定和评估过程中的应用。

Result: 发现了决策-评估悖论，证明该悖论在现实的公理结构中普遍存在，揭示了在训练决策模型和应用公理时需要格外谨慎。

Conclusion: 决策-评估悖论的存在表明，在基于决策数据训练模型或应用公理进行决策制定和评估时，必须非常小心以避免内在矛盾。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Motivation: 现有旅行规划代理依赖手工提示和固定工作流程，限制了代理的灵活性和自主性。

Method: 构建沙盒环境缓存交通、住宿和POI数据；开发分层奖励建模系统（轨迹级验证器和轮次级验证器）；提出回放增强强化学习方法，从失败经验缓冲区周期性回放。

Result: 在滴滴企业解决方案App上的评估显示，DeepTravel使小型LLM（如Qwen3 32B）在旅行规划任务中显著优于OpenAI o1、o3和DeepSeek R1等前沿LLM。

Conclusion: DeepTravel框架成功构建了自主旅行规划代理，通过强化学习和分层奖励系统实现了高效的旅行规划能力。

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的多智能体系统研究缺乏受控实验的原则性方法，限制了新兴行为研究的进展。

Method: Shachi框架将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特质）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个组件，由LLM推理引擎协调。

Result: 在10个任务的基准测试中验证了方法有效性，通过模拟美国关税冲击实验证明，只有当智能体认知架构正确配置记忆和工具时，其行为才能与观察到的市场反应一致。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建和评估LLM智能体提供了严谨的开源基础，旨在促进更具累积性和科学基础的研究。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新的图表示学习范式，通过层次化Transformer和函数偏移学习来解决计算图建模问题，在电子电路等复杂计算图上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流消息传递神经网络和传统Transformer在计算图建模上存在架构不匹配问题，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性。

Method: 使用层次化Transformer模拟逐步计算流程，并引入函数偏移学习目标，通过预测真实全局函数与简单局部近似之间的差异来解耦学习问题。

Result: 在电子电路等复杂计算图的综合基准测试中，TRACE大幅优于所有现有架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标构成了更稳健的计算图学习范式。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了DyRo-MCTS方法，将动作鲁棒性估计集成到MCTS中，用于动态作业车间调度问题，显著提升了离线学习策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态作业车间调度面临新作业频繁到达的干扰，离线学习策略往往不完美，而在线规划又因问题信息不完整而容易受到扰动影响。

Method: DyRo-MCTS方法在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境朝向既产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态。

Result: 实验表明DyRo-MCTS显著提升了离线学习策略的性能，且在线规划时间增加可忽略不计，在各种调度场景下始终优于传统MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动下实现了长期可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现ML模型在准确性上优于SPM，且两种方法的解释都被专家认为清晰有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其异常检测能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: ML模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM错误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释ML在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策方面至关重要。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理的潜力，导致计划不一致和冗余通信，降低协作效率。需要开发能够推理协作伙伴意图的协作能力。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，使用符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，通过LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新，主动检测潜在协调问题并自适应通信。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，CoBel-World显著减少通信成本22-60%，提高任务完成效率4-28%，优于最强基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理所需的多样化、深度嵌入的网页数据，这些代理通常局限于单步任务，缺乏管理动态交互内容的能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（8,492个单步和2,386个多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802个单步和320个多步轨迹）和RISK-R1强化微调框架，该框架从输出格式、单步级别、多步级别和任务级别四个方面进行优化。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网页交互提供了可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推动了电子商务风险管理的最新技术发展。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

Method: 从零开始在合成关系知识图数据集上训练语言模型，分析隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构，并测试模型编辑的传播效果。

Result: 训练出的模型在隐藏表示中出现了双线性关系结构，这显著缓解了反转诅咒，使模型能够推断未见过的反向事实，并且编辑操作能正确传播到相关事实。

Conclusion: 模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的底层表示几何结构。双线性内部表示使语言模型在编辑后能保持逻辑一致性。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

*Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Song Mei,Stuart Russell,Nikhil Ghosh,Alberto Bietti,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GSM-Agent基准测试，评估LLM在需要主动收集信息解决小学数学问题时的代理推理能力，发现即使是前沿模型准确率也仅67%。提出了代理推理图概念和分析方法，并开发了工具增强的测试时扩展方法来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂数学推理、专家级知识等高级能力混在一起，难以单独评估代理推理能力。需要构建专门基准来分离和评估代理推理能力。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准，要求LLM代理解决小学数学问题但只提供问题不提供前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息。提出代理推理图概念，将环境文档嵌入聚类为节点，映射工具调用构建推理路径。开发工具增强的测试时扩展方法鼓励模型重新访问节点。

Result: 即使是GPT-5等前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准上准确率也仅为67%。通过代理推理图分析发现，许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问先前节点的能力，而这种能力在静态推理中被认为是关键模式。

Conclusion: GSM-Agent基准和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究。工具增强的测试时扩展方法能够有效提高LLM的代理推理性能。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间的差距，这种差距通常只在多次解决方案路径中才能显现。

Method: 采用非对称两阶段推理框架：探索器模型通过重复采样并行生成潜在解决方案，合成器模型整合这些参考进行更精细的第二阶段推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（Qwen3-4B探索器+Qwen3-8B合成器）超越Qwen3-32B模型平均性能，成本降低近30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，更是实际应用中的高效实用解决方案，能够正交扩展计算并有效利用模型潜力。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 现实机器人系统需要同时平衡多个相互冲突的目标，但现有复杂目标交互的问题公式无法直接使用现成的先进多目标搜索算法。

Method: 提出广义问题公式，通过隐藏目标的聚合函数优化解决方案目标，只需适当扩展核心操作以反映特定聚合函数，即可应用标准多目标搜索算法。

Result: 在导航、操作、医疗系统障碍不确定性规划、检查规划和不同道路类型的路线规划等多个机器人规划问题中，扩展后的算法比原始版本性能提升数个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提出的广义问题公式能够有效支持标准多目标搜索算法的应用，通过适当扩展核心操作，在多种机器人规划场景中显著提升算法性能。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

Motivation: 随着AI快速发展带来的环境影响日益显著，现有能耗估算工具虽然易于使用但存在准确性疑问，需要系统验证其可靠性。

Method: 通过提出的验证框架，将静态和动态能耗估算方法与数百个AI实验的真实测量数据进行系统比较。

Conclusion: 本研究为AI可持续发展提供了能耗估算质量的实证证据，验证了广泛使用的工具，并提出了改进指南，对资源感知的ML和AI可持续性研究做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个结合结构化两级规划和用户行为日志任务挖掘的GUI任务自动化系统，解决了现有LLM/VLM方法在泛化性、延迟和长序列一致性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划-执行代理存在脆弱的泛化能力、高延迟和有限的长序列一致性，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: 结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法：1）高层规划将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典；2）任务挖掘识别用户特定模式；3）低层规划将高层计划基于实时GUI上下文转化为动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，任务成功率和执行时间显著改善，在长序列任务中保持超过60.0%的成功率，突显其在复杂多步骤工作流中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结构化规划和任务挖掘实现了鲁棒且自适应的GUI自动化，在复杂任务和UI变化下表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注存在不确定性和分歧，传统聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，影响模型评估的准确性。

Method: 提出使用概率指标来明确处理标注不确定性，这些指标可独立于标注生成过程，计算轻量且具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估，使性能估计更好地反映临床数据特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in

Motivation: 现代状态空间模型使用结构化转移矩阵虽然计算高效，但表达能力受限；而无结构矩阵虽然表达能力最优，但计算和内存成本过高。

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使并行扫描的计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系。

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了状态空间模型的表达能力，能够有效跟踪复杂有限状态自动机的状态。

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实生成方法对LLM的解释存在歧义，要么没有字面解释LLM（假设可以改变采样实现而不改变LLM本身），要么没有按意图解释LLM（将非确定性LLM表示为确定性因果模型）。

Method: 基于LLM的意图解释，将其表示为非确定性因果模型来生成反事实，该方法对任何黑盒LLM都直接适用且无需修改。

Result: 新方法比现有方法更简单，且对实现细节不可知，而现有方法虽然能直接生成特定类型的反事实，但适用范围有限。

Conclusion: 为LLM中的反事实推理提供了理论基础，基于意图语义为特定应用的反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains

Method: 构建包含190个专家标注跟踪记录的基准测试，每个记录包含证据标注，用于分析代理是否基于观察证据生成推理步骤、自适应重新制定搜索以及正确评估证据充分性。

Result: 开发了首个专门评估LLM搜索代理认知能力的基准测试，提供了1800多个响应步骤的详细分析框架。

Conclusion: SeekBench填补了现有评估方法的空白，为深入理解LLM搜索代理的推理能力和证据处理能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents
with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA).
However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking
how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce
SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence}
of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces.
SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了EMMA框架，通过DreamTransfer生成多视角一致的机器人操作视频和AdaMix训练策略，显著提升视觉-语言-动作模型在未见物体类别和新视觉领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，限制了VLA模型的泛化能力。需要一种方法来生成多样化的训练数据以克服这一瓶颈。

Method: 1. DreamTransfer：基于扩散Transformer的框架，生成多视角一致、几何基础的机器人操作视频；2. AdaMix：硬样本感知训练策略，动态重新加权训练批次；3. 混合真实和生成数据的训练方法。

Result: 生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性方面显著优于现有方法。在零样本视觉领域的真实机器人操作任务中，相比仅使用真实数据训练，性能提升超过200%，结合AdaMix后进一步提升13%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成多样化训练数据和优化训练策略，有效提升了VLA模型的泛化能力，使机器人能够仅基于单一外观的演示就能泛化到未见物体类别和新视觉领域。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASAL++是基于ASAL的改进方法，利用多模态基础模型进行开放式搜索，通过第二个基础模型根据模拟的视觉历史提出新的进化目标，从而产生具有日益复杂目标的进化轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为人工生命领域提供了强大的工具来自动化搜索模拟，先前工作使用视觉语言模型将ALife模拟与自然语言目标提示对齐。本文旨在构建更开放式的搜索方法。

Method: 引入ASAL++方法，使用第二个基础模型根据模拟视觉历史提出新的进化目标。探索两种策略：EST（每次迭代匹配单个新提示）和ETT（匹配整个生成提示序列）。在Lenia基质中使用Gemma-3进行实证测试。

Result: 实证结果显示，EST促进了更大的视觉新颖性，而ETT培养了更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指出了具有开放式特征的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

*Shichao Weng,Zhiqiang Wang,Yuhua Zhou,Rui Lu,Ting Liu,Zhiyang Teng,Xiaozhang Liu,Hanmeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，将几何推理重新定义为交互式的感知-推理-行动循环，通过动态操作图表来解决几何问题，显著优于静态感知方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型将图表处理为静态图像，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类的几何推理涉及辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: 集成三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤，草图操作模块执行绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作。采用两阶段训练：监督微调+强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试上，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率，优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一层次化决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，GeoSketch将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM智能体开发需要精心设计的工作流程、提示词和迭代调优，这些手工限制阻碍了智能体在不同行业中的可扩展性和成本效益。

Method: 提出金字塔状DAG多智能体框架，包含：智能体即工具机制、双审计机制、智能体路由功能和自进化机制，支持原子任务并行执行。

Result: 在多个基准测试中比ADAS框架性能提升9.9%，案例研究显示InfiHelper生成的科研论文获得了IEEE顶级会议人类评审的认可。

Conclusion: InfiAgent框架能够演变成一个通用的金字塔状多智能体系统，能够解决广泛的问题，显著提高了LLM智能体的执行效率和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论中赋权概念的新评估框架EELMA，用于评估语言模型代理在开放环境中的能力，替代传统人工设计的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型代理能力增强并接入真实世界工具，需要可扩展的评估框架。传统基准测试设计成本高且需要人工设计有效任务。

Method: 引入EELMA算法，通过多轮文本交互近似计算代理行动与未来状态之间的互信息（赋权），在语言游戏和网页浏览场景中验证。

Result: 赋权与平均任务性能强相关，能表征环境复杂性和代理因素（思维链、模型规模、记忆长度）的影响，高赋权状态往往是关键能力时刻。

Conclusion: 赋权是评估复杂开放环境中语言模型代理的有吸引力的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要提供可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确表示形成的流形之间的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并跟踪模型各层的偏差变化来定位分歧点。

Result: 实验验证了推理流形的低维特性，以及错误与正确推理表示之间的高可分性，证明了REMA框架在分析推理失败起源方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在社会模拟中存在两种不同的社会倾向："适应性利己主义者"和"利他主义优化者"，揭示了LLM内在的社会行为逻辑异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽略了大规模智能体社会中利他主义的涌现机制，需要理解LLM所体现的社会逻辑。

Method: 引入Schelling变体的城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己和利他目标间进行权衡；采用基于扎根理论的系统编码方法来分析智能体决策的认知基础。

Result: 识别出两种不同的社会行为原型：适应性利己主义者默认优先考虑自身利益，但在社会规范影响下利他行为显著增加；利他主义优化者表现出固有的利他逻辑，始终优先集体利益。

Conclusion: 模型选择不仅是推理能力的选择，更是内在社会行为逻辑的选择。适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，而利他主义优化者更适合模拟理想化亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自演化的框架，通过生成式过程监督解决LLM在运筹学问题中的训练挑战，采用策略模型和生成过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：结果奖励存在信用分配问题（正确最终答案可能强化错误推理），传统判别式过程监督短视且无法全面评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: StepORLM采用协同进化循环，策略模型和生成过程奖励模型(GenPRM)相互迭代改进，通过双反馈机制（外部求解器的确定性结果验证和GenPRM的细致过程评估）结合加权直接偏好优化(W-DPO)进行对齐。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平，显著优于更大的通用模型、代理方法和专用基线。协同进化的GenPRM可作为强大且普遍适用的过程验证器，大幅提升推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化机制有效解决了运筹学问题中LLM训练的信用分配和过程评估问题，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流水线中会导致重复的质量下降，无法满足多模态交互通信的需求。

Method: 采用轻量级基于Transformer的熵模型，包含通用、掩码和文本条件三种场景特定设计，有效最小化token间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、扩展和视觉问答等任务上，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率(<0.05bpp)下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信建立了一个实用且前瞻的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

TL;DR: 提出了动态专家搜索（DES），一种在推理时通过调整MoE模型中激活专家数量来增强推理能力的测试时缩放策略，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中观察到调整激活专家数量能产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了一个未被充分探索的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：动态MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量以生成多样化推理轨迹）和专家配置继承（在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在不同运行间变化，平衡稳定性和多样性）。

Result: 在多个MoE架构、验证器和推理基准（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线，在不增加成本的情况下提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES是一种实用且可扩展的架构感知测试时缩放方法，展示了现代LLMs中结构灵活性如何推进推理能力。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过图抽象模型分析RL在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现SFT会产生伪相关解，RL通过探索实现正确规划，但PG存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q-learning能保持多样性并避免奖励黑客。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 使用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度(PG)和Q-learning方法，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: SFT引入伪相关解，RL通过探索实现更好泛化；PG存在多样性崩溃，Q-learning能保持多样性；需要精心设计奖励函数防止奖励黑客。

Conclusion: RL在LLM规划中的有效性主要来自探索机制，Q-learning优于PG在于能保持输出多样性，但需要谨慎的奖励设计。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.
