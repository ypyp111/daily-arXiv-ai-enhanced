For the linear systems stemming\nfrom polytopal discretizations, such as Polytopal Discontinuous Galerkin\n(PolyDG) and Virtual Element Methods (VEM), AMG sensitivity to such choices is\neven more critical due to the significant variability of the underlying meshes,\nwhich results in algebraic systems with different sparsity patterns.

However, their exponentially\nincreasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario.

The framework separates data into source and target domains,\nextracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled\nsubset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with\nBalanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the\ntarget domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from\n57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is\nevaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven\ninstance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides\nmore accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable\ntraffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based\nplanning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader\ndeployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems."}

In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the\nscore interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the\npenalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly\nestimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),\nyielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled\nboth semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical\nminimum, indicative of structural youth.

These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,\ntask-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in\nartificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von\nNeumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,\nand Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence."}

To address this, we introduce\nSoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard\nclipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient\nmagnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various\ndatasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured\nhealthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip\nreduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%\ncompared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are\nstatistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of\nintegrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and\nprivate model training."}

We\nfocus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and\ncritic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals.

Although both suites\ninvolve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to\nsharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing\nin cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This\nreveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into\nalgorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues\nbehind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that\ninduce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy\ncoevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model\nvariance and produces error-prone rollouts.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

This opens up the\npossibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal\nmodalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of\nhealth monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a\npromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support\nmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on\nknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside\nstudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.\nThis challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation\nmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at\nthe cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for\nunsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a\nlightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable\ninformation flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,\nwe introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the\nbridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the\nbridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal\nmodalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of\ntrainable parameters by 88--99\\% while maintaining or even improving transfer\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

Yet whether RL can push PLMs\nbeyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function\nrules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four\ndomains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody\nengineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model\nclasses, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it\nreveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL\nconsistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a\nthree-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity\njointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies\nhave sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,\nimprovements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains\nsaturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in\nprotein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling\npolicy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,\nand allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest.

This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial\nfor factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure\nthis ability.

On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are\nproxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes\nrather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the\nRefusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs\nrefuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation\nbetween refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically\nmeasurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently\nestimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.\nExtensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI\naccurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in\nfactual tasks.

Profiling three\ninstruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key\nfindings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)\ndatasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)\ncode-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show\nonly modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities\nirrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling\ntherefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into\nuser-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and\nmodel interpretability."}

We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning.

(ii) We explore three ways to infer\nthe physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the\nvisual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer\nvision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and\ntrainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and\nself-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in\na generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though\nbehind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other\nmodels, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting."}

Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher\nstrategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance\nPolicy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages\nguidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy\nmodel fails to generate correct solutions. This \"guidance-on-demand\" approach\nexpands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery.

While the majority of studies on the topic\nreport a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that\nfairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing\nhyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models\n(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common\npractice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)\ncomparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and\n2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that\na disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact\non another.

Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

To explain this striking\ndifference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability\nof attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can\ntransfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not\nwithout geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and\nempirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings.

Second, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as\nsuccessful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak\nthe attacked models but again fail to transfer.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology.

Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple\nstate-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL\nperformance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves\nsubstantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank\ncorrelation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for\nbroad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on\nunique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two\nepochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training\nonly on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often\nleads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying\nlengths.

Semi-supervised\nGAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during\ntraining, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the\nnormality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the\nlabeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These\ncan lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework\nthat leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from\na teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly\nscore and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,\nanomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality\nregularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by\naligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to\naccurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in\nthe teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of\nthe normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more\nseparable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the\nteacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed\nto regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the\nrepresentations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a\nperturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes."}

We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning.

After training on open-source\ndata with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability\nand performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,\nachieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about\nthree percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without\nadditional tricks.

Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their\nknowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial\nfor factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure\nthis ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by\nrefusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different\nrefusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are\nproxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes\nrather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the\nRefusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs\nrefuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation\nbetween refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically\nmeasurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently\nestimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.\nExtensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI\naccurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in\nfactual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and\nprovides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy\nand refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but\npreviously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high\naccuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and\nfragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy\nmetrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation."}

In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise.
