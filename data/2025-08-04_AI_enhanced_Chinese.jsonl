Fluid Mech., 862, 871-888) and\nenergy harvesting efficiency (e.g. Mathai et al., 2022, J. Fluid Mech., 942,\nR4) compared to rigid foils. Here, we numerically investigate the effects of\nthe stretching coefficient (or aeroelastic number), $K_S$, the flapping\nfrequency, $St_c$, and the pitching amplitude, $\\theta_0$, on the propulsive\nperformance of a compliant membrane undergoing combined heaving and pitching in\nuniform flow. Distinct optimal values of $K_S$ are identified that respectively\nmaximize thrust and efficiency: thrust can be increased by 200%, and efficiency\nby 100%, compared to the rigid case. Interestingly, these optima do not occur\nat resonance but at frequency ratios (flapping to natural) below unity, and\nthis ratio increases with flapping frequency. Using a force decomposition based\non the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor $Q$, which measures the\nrelative strength between the rotation and deformation of fluid elements, we\nshow that thrust primarily arises from $Q$-induced and body-acceleration\nforces. The concave membrane surface can trap the leading-edge vortex (LEV)\nfrom the previous half-stroke, generating detrimental $Q$-induced drag.\nHowever, moderate concave membrane deformation weakens this LEV and enhances\nbody-acceleration-induced thrust. Thus, the optimal $K_S$ for maximum thrust\noccurs below resonance, balancing beneficial deformation against excessive\ndrag. Furthermore, by introducing the membrane's deformation into a tangential\nangle at the leading edge and substituting it into an existing scaling law\ndeveloped for rigid plates, we obtain predictive estimates for the thrust and\npower coefficients of the membrane.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u62c9\u4f38\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u6251\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4fef\u4ef0\u5e45\u5ea6\u5bf9\u67d4\u6027\u819c\u63a8\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d4\u6027\u819c\u5728\u975e\u5171\u632f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u67d4\u6027\u819c\u5728\u6251\u52a8\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u673a\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u67d4\u6027\u819c\u7684\u6251\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u62c9\u4f38\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u6251\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4fef\u4ef0\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u529b\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6da1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u529b\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u67d4\u6027\u819c\u5728\u975e\u5171\u632f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63a8\u529b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347200%\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347100%\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u4e8eQ\u8bf1\u5bfc\u529b\u548c\u4f53\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u67d4\u6027\u819c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f62\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u529b\u548c\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u5171\u632f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u8fdb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with\nthree datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)\nKinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural\nvideo datasets.

Although frequency domain formulations are\nwell suited to capturing time-periodic solutions, such as unstable periodic\norbits, this study focusses on modelling statistically stationary flows by\ncomputing long-time solutions that approximate their underlying statistics. In\ncontrast to traditional ROMs based solely on spatial modes, a space-time\nformulation achieves simultaneous reduction in both space and time. This is\naccomplished by Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations onto the\nbasis using a space-time inner product, yielding a quadratic algebraic system\nof equations in the unknown amplitude coefficients. Solutions of the ROM are\nobtained by identifying amplitude coefficients that minimise an objective\nfunction corresponding to the sum of the squares of the residuals of the\nalgebraic system across all frequencies and modes, quantifying the aggregate\nviolation of momentum conservation within the reduced subspace. A robust\ngradient-based optimisation algorithm is employed to identify the minima of\nthis objective function. The method is demonstrated for chaotic flow in a\ntwo-dimensional lid-driven cavity at $Re=20{,}000$, where solutions with\nextended temporal periods approximately fifteen times the dominant shear layer\ntime scale are sought.

Topographic constraints in\nneural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different\nimpacts on the representations learned by the network.

To this end,\nhere we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two\nspatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to\ndevelop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which\nenforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared\nto both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved\nrobustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)\ngreater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)\nstronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations\npositioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in\norientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units,\nindicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational\ngeometry of the network.

Using a regression technique that embeds\nthe update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under\nupdates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor\nextension of) SHACL. We analyze the computational complexity of the static\nvalidation problem for SHACL and some key fragments. Finally, we present a\nprototype implementation that performs static validation and other static\nanalysis tasks on SHACL constraints and demonstrate its behavior through\npreliminary experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76SHACL\u5728RDF\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSHACL\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aSHACL\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\uff08\u4e0d\uff09\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RDF\u56fe\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301SHACL\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001RDF\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSHACL\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u5d4c\u5165SHACL\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u9759\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aSHACL\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\uff08\u4e0d\uff09\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001RDF\u56fe\u7684SHACL\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present\nin various environments and select representative environments for our\nbenchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,\ngames, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory\nimprovable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete\nsignal for partial observability research.

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically\nincreased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the\nlimitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high\nheterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision\ndomains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A\nTri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly\nDetection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features\nthrough a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input\ntime series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,\npretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from\nwhich anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public\nbenchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation\nmetric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to\nensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating\nstrong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,\nwe verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.\nCompared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch\nprocessing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it\nmore suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine\nlearning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification\nof tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded\nassessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a\ngatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways\nthat are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address\nthis issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,\nsuch as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and\nclose-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better\nposition to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved\nstudent learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone.

To appear in the AIES Proceedings. 14 pages, 2\n  figures, 2 tables. Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0", "summary": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These\nfindings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and\nmoral beliefs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b02022\u5e74\u540e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u4e0eLLM\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76AI\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b2210\u4e07\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u975e\u811a\u672c\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790ChatGPT\u53d1\u5e03\u524d\u540e\u4e0eLLM\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "2022\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e0eLLM\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6f14\u53d8\u8fd8\u662fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, their diagnostic\nreliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to\nenhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We\npropose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured\nclinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct\nClinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines\nfor three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute\npancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head\nIdentification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's\netiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we\nintroduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds\netiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected\nEtiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided\nLoss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework\nimproves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning\nFocus Score by 31.6% over baselines.

Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer\nblock, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through\nsupervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data\nsubsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as\ninput improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation\non the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic\nconditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for\nefficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM-PTx\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06CLIP\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u5165SAM\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faParallel-Text\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684CLIP\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165SAM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fee\u6539MLP\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728COD10K\u3001COCO\u548cADE20K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914dSAM\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002"}}

We observe that\nsuch hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification\nmechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{CoRGI}(\\textbf{C}hain \\textbf{o}f \\textbf{R}easoning with\n\\textbf{G}rounded \\textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces\nvisual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage\npipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts\nsupporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module\n(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to\ngenerate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with\nexisting VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR\nbenchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative\nopen-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6.

Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and\nshape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in\nbiological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the\nlimited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive\nmulti-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an\nextended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a\nunified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key\ninnovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer\n(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture\npartitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)\nand taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and\ncommon anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical\nshortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces\ntwo large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for\nbirds.

To address this limitation, we present a novel framework\nfor controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by\nintegrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach\nbegins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera\nviews, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and\nstitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view\nspatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable\narea, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control\nconditions.

While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time\nseries data.

Experiments on nine\nhomophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified\nconfidence intervals on unseen nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "SGPC\uff08Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec6\u80de\u9798\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u548cPAC-Bayes\u8c31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GNN\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\uff08heterophilic graphs\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9798\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6216\u590d\u6742\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u9798\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSGPC\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec6\u80de\u9798\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u548cPAC-Bayes\u8c31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u540c\u8d28\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSGPC\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SGPC\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GNN\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,\ni.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient\nfeature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the\nspatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas\nprior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior\nfeature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified\nspatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby\nenhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios.

To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel\nneural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume\nrendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.\nFirstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the\nneural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by\ninsufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and\nsmoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an\nuncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in\nareas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry\ndetails for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce\nhigh-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with\nsmall overlapping views.

To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has\nproposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative\ntokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been\ndeveloped to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction\nand its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most\ntraining-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to\ndetermine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a\ntraining-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each\ntoken's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with\nFlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further\ngeneralizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression\ncompatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and\n4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively.

Faced with real-world\ngraphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences,\ntermed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection\npipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual\ninformation into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks\nwithin the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding\nprocess is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph\ndomain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus\non GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability.\nHow to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast\npotential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging\nissue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed\ngraph anomaly detection, named CMUCL.

Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace.

Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel\nnumber is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.\nHowever, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer\ngeneration quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the\nquality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of\nautoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key\ninnovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a\ntraining-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the\nlatent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter\nlatent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an\naugmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training\nobjectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these\ntechniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling\nresults than DC-AE.

This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features.

The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects.

Yu"], "title": "DP-DGAD: A Generalist Dynamic Graph Anomaly Detector with Dynamic Prototypes", "comment": null, "summary": "Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies\nin evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social\nnetworks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones.

However, most existing GDA methods rely\non the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world\nscenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely\nimpairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain\nshifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,\nsemantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the\nfeature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeGPR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e72\u51c0\u6e90\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u62d3\u6251\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5d4c\u5957\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNeGPR\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe12.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "NeGPR\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework\nthat, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to\nmulti-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT\nmodel, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group\nIsolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)\nRegion-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To\ncomprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three\nmetrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout\ncontrol; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background\nconsistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing\nmulti-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all\nsettings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results\ndemonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background\npreservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any\ntraining or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability.

In the context of complex, nonlinear\nfinite element modeling environments, this can become computationally\nchallenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To\naddress this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with\nadaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating\nuncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a\nhigh-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a\ndeep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly\ncorrelated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to\nbalance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand\nassociated with the development of the low-fidelity model.

In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner.

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification.

Through extensive evaluation, we identify key\nfactors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,\nincluding: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and\nthe likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between\nsingle-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image\ncontexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional\nplacement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of\nobject identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image\nattention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention\nproportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that\nour method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic\nintegration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u57fa\u51c6MIHBench\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMIHBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u6574\u5408\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u56fe\u50cfMLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework\ndesigned to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel\ndual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of\nlearnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to\nadaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)\na label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt\nparameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.\nExtensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that\nPILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and\nlocalization under domain shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "PILOT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u6709\u9650\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "PILOT\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPILOT\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "PILOT\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.
