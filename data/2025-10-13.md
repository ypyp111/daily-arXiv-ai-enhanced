### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了微调的传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据（少于1000张图像）就能获得36%的准确率提升，达到或超过需要大量数据的CNN基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在动态上下文推理、语言引导提示和整体场景理解方面具有新能力，但其在专门视觉任务上的潜力尚未充分开发，往往导致性能不理想。

Method: 在图像中人工文本叠加检测这一挑战性任务上，对微调的传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行了全面比较。

Result: LLM仅需非常有限的数据（少于1000张图像）就能有效微调，获得高达36%的准确率提升，匹配或超过了通常需要数量级更多数据的CNN基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了基于LLM的方法在现实世界物体检测任务中的适应性和数据效率，为在低资源视觉环境中应用多模态transformer提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对U-Net在脑肿瘤MRI分割中的性能进行了可重复评估，使用焦点损失函数和基础数据增强策略，在公开数据集上取得了90%的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展，需要建立可重复的基准研究。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合焦点损失函数进行参数调优，并评估三种数据增强技术（水平翻转、旋转、缩放）的影响。

Result: U-Net结合焦点损失函数实现了90%的精确度，与最先进方法结果相当。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究为脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计建立了透明、可重复的基准。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，既能降低记忆化又能保持图像与文本的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)会导致图像与提示对齐不佳，需要促进更早逃离记忆化吸引盆地。

Method: 通过实证观察发现不同初始噪声样本导致不同的逃离时间，提出两种缓解策略：集体或单独调整初始噪声，寻找能促进更早逃离吸引盆地的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像与文本的对齐质量。

Conclusion: 初始噪声样本在决定记忆化逃离时间中起关键作用，通过适当调整初始噪声可以有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram在生成职业图像时都强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同，强调了AI可视化工具可能强化狭隘表征的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AI生成可视化内容的创作过程和质量，忽视了表征偏见问题，特别是在职业场景中的性别偏见。

Method: 通过生成750多张AI职业图像，使用DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个工具，并进行主题分析来评估表征偏见。

Result: 两个AI图像生成工具都强化了传统性别刻板印象，DALL-E 3和Ideogram在这方面表现程度不同。

Conclusion: 需要为从业者、个人和研究人员提供建议，以在生成具有可见性别的图像时增加表征多样性。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型(VAR)中引入动态混合专家路由器，通过尺度感知阈值在不需额外训练的情况下实现计算效率与图像质量的平衡，减少20% FLOPs并加速推理11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAR模型在不同分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致的计算冗余问题，提升模型效率。

Method: 在VAR架构中集成动态混合专家路由器，采用基于token复杂度和分辨率的尺度感知阈值策略来选择专家。

Result: 实现了20% FLOPs减少、11%推理加速，同时保持了与原始密集基线模型相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 动态混合专家路由机制有效解决了VAR的计算冗余问题，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误判为OOD。需要一种能准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数，从中提取认知不确定性进行OOD检测，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比基于预测熵的方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降至40%（降低36%）。

Conclusion: 基于认知不确定性的层次贝叶斯方法能有效分离不确定性类型，显著改善无监督OOD检测性能，无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率识别已知活动的同时拒绝未知活动，并可将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在无法逾越的差距：现实生活中的活动范围远大于标注传感器数据集中能捕获的活动范围。未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱任何HAR分类器的可靠性。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次结构，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，可同时实现已知活动的准确识别和未知活动的拒绝。

Result: 开发了新的数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行19种来自不同情境的活动数据，完全公开可供下载。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅实现了开放集分类，还允许将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点，提供了超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察力。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督聚类的高频振荡自动检测方法，在80-500Hz频段内区分HFO事件与尖峰、背景活动和伪迹，在控制数据集上达到97.67%敏感度和98.57%精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别HFO耗时费力且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用时频域S变换提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分HFO与尖峰、背景活动和伪迹。

Result: 在控制数据集上敏感度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F值97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点HFO率比值为0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFO是有前景的癫痫生物标志物，切除HFO特别是快速波纹可达到无癫痫发作，而残留HFO会导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv2视觉表示分析：通过稀疏自编码器发现功能专业化（分类使用否定概念、分割依赖边界检测、深度估计采用单眼深度线索），表示部分密集且具有几何结构，提出基于概念空间的Minkowski表示假说


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DINOv2模型感知的本质，探索其内部表示的结构和组织方式

Method: 采用线性表示假说，使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)学习32,000个单元的字典，分析下游任务的概念使用模式、表示几何统计特性

Result: 发现功能专业化现象，表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构，提出基于原型混合的Minkowski表示假说

Conclusion: 视觉变换器表示具有超越线性稀疏的组织结构，基于概念空间的Minkowski表示假说为理解其机制提供了新视角

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光），在三个基准数据集上全面超越现有方法，同时显著降低参数数量和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理遥感图像采集过程中复杂的异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)进行渐进式退化挖掘，结合物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集(MD-RSID、MD-RRSHID、MDRS-Landsat)上，PhyDAE在所有四种修复任务中都取得了优越性能，同时显著减少了参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，为遥感图像退化修复提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

*Kang Liao,Size Wu,Zhonghua Wu,Linyi Jin,Chao Wang,Yikai Wang,Fei Wang,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来整合空间理解和生成能力，在4百万视觉-语言-相机三元组数据集上训练，在相机中心任务上表现优于专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。需要开发统一的模型来扩展相机维度的空间感知能力。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，整合语言回归和基于扩散的生成方法，使用全局相机参数和像素级相机映射，在Puffin-4M数据集上训练。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，通过指令调优可泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结内部网络结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚来提升小样本迁移学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型对领域特定特征的适应能力，在数据极少时仍容易过拟合

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构（如卷积滤波器），同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数使模型适应特定数据

Result: 在三个小样本医学影像分类任务上评估SOR，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础模型取得了与现有基准相竞争的结果

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛的适用性

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提升MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为系统评估MLLMs的具身能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受生物学启发的对抗防御框架，通过模拟人类视觉系统的三个关键机制（中央-外周处理、扫视眼动和皮层填充）来增强深度学习模型的鲁棒性，无需重新训练分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御方法计算密集，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具有对抗扰动的鲁棒性。研究假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 使用强化学习引导的扫视来选择性捕获多个中央-外周图像片段，将这些片段整合成重建图像后再进行分类。该方法作为预处理步骤，无需修改下游分类器。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了系统对各种分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著降低了训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物学启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且能与现有系统无缝集成，为对抗防御提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的关键挑战，实现了SOTA感知质量和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，造成计算瓶颈。线性注意力虽然提供线性复杂度解决方案，但在真实感超分辨率中面临训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决挑战。

Method: 1. 使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2. 采用SNR-based混合专家架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3. 建立基于"精度优先于数量"原则的轻量级引导范式TAG。

Result: LinearSR在核心扩散前向传播中实现SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力，同时提供最先进的感知质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为在真实感超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了首个稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于计算机视觉的无监督关键帧提取管道，用于新西兰濒危鹦鹉kākā的个体识别和重识别，替代传统的物理标记方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入式的高效自动化监测方案。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从定制喂食器的视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高准确率，为在更具挑战性的环境中使用媒体数据进行研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这种基于人工智能和计算机视觉的非侵入式方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的新方法开发。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

*Shuo Xing,Soumik Dey,Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个基于多层级模型路由的智能视频质量评估框架，通过视觉语言模型动态选择专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型泛化性差、可解释性弱和扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型存在三个主要问题：跨不同内容和任务的泛化能力差（从用户生成内容到AI生成内容）、可解释性有限、以及对新用例或内容类型的扩展性不足。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型性能，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性。在Q-Bench-Video基准测试中表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router通过智能路由设计结合了专业模型的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中实现了灵活性和鲁棒性，有望成为下一代VQA系统的基础，并可作为视频生成模型后训练中的奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的医学视觉问答框架，通过多级模态对齐、硬负样本挖掘和门控交叉注意力模块来解决模态对齐不统一、硬负样本问题和知识融合中的无关信息问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Med-VQA任务中缺乏统一的模态对齐解决方案，硬负样本问题研究不足，且常用的知识融合技术可能引入无关信息。

Method: 1) 多级、多模态、多视图、多阶段的统一模态对齐方案，使用对比学习和最优传输理论；2) 使用软标签的硬负样本挖掘方法，加强硬负样本对区分；3) 将答案词汇作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等常用Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的模态对齐、硬负样本挖掘和选择性知识融合，有效提升了医学视觉问答的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一种加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在处理视频时速度慢、成本高，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益甚微，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过选择性处理视频区域，在保持感知质量的同时显著加速视频超分辨率处理，为更高分辨率和更长视频的处理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型适配到视频领域面临感知瓶颈和token过载的挑战，需要处理密集且时间延展的视觉输入。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间token聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重构为子问题）两种策略。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe有效提升了各种基准测试中的视频理解能力，在长视频基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架能够有效处理复杂的视频语言任务，具有处理长视频内容的潜力。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像并使用视觉语言模型分类，但会引入2D遮挡噪声且计算内存成本高，推理速度慢

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中，学生模型可直接从点云分类实例

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题，实现了高性能和快速推理

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可应用于其他作物和应用场景，为作物生长监测提供了一种无需繁琐标注的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

TL;DR: PHyCLIP使用双曲空间的ℓ₁乘积度量来同时表达概念层次结构和跨概念组合性，在多个任务上优于单空间方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念家族内的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念家族的组合性（如"车里的狗"⊆狗,车），双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次但组合性表示能力不明确。

Method: 提出PHyCLIP，在双曲空间的笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁乘积度量，让概念家族内层次在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念组合通过ℓ₁乘积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积度量成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本表现出显著脆弱性，但现有攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。复杂的上下文依赖性和特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 提出SegTrans框架：将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成增强样本，用这些样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种不同分割模型和三种骨干网络上进行实验，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans在不引入额外计算开销的情况下，显著提高了对抗样本在不同分割模型间的迁移能力，优于当前最先进方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在5个图像修复任务上的实验表明，ASVP可将学生模型的PSNR降低达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，而对教师模型性能影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像修复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了Ro-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在动态分布外反事实视频上的鲁棒性，发现现有模型性能显著下降，但通过反事实数据微调可大幅提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、对象、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估了8个最新的视频MLLMs。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著性能下降，但使用反事实数据微调MLLMs可将Ro-Bench性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLMs的视频理解能力，证明了其在提升模型鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，传统迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大数据集而失效，需要针对动物监测的特殊挑战开发专门的数据增强策略。

Method: 采用对象聚焦的数据增强框架，从背景中分割动物，通过变换和扩散合成技术生成真实多样的场景，专门用于数据受限的动物健康监测。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上比基线模型表现更优，能够提升检测和监测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能支持实时动物健康监测解决方案，弥合有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过分解复杂感知问题为可处理的子问题，显著提升大视觉语言模型的视觉感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于推理时间扩展的方法在提升LVLMs推理能力方面取得成功，但它们在视觉感知任务上的效果尚不明确。现有LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对底层感知过程的建模。

Method: 提出Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为中间可处理的子问题，结合强化学习技术，使感知能够与推理时间扩展对齐并从中受益。

Result: PTS显著提升了感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好。即使PTS数据是纯合成的，与数学推理数据结合也能在推理和真实世界感知基准上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关token并增加模型对图像token的关注，有效解决了当前LVLMs在视觉感知任务上的局限性，为提升多模态模型的感知能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式地表示关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断关节位置，这种对先验知识的过度依赖会降低下游任务（如手势和活动识别）的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器的输出增强额外的关节描述符，估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，而不是减轻偏差。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置中使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints估计描述符的错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式表示姿态估计中的偏差，提高了可解释性和下游任务性能，在毫米波姿态估计中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出HiMIR框架，通过分层多粒度图像检索和跨层次相似性一致性，在提高检索精度的同时减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有多向量检索方法在图像对象对齐和细粒度分割冗余方面存在不足。

Method: 采用分层范式处理不同图像对象，利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算，并自动配置数据集参数。

Result: 在精度显著提升的同时，计算量比现有MVR系统减少最多3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架在精度和效率方面均优于现有方法，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务HandEval，通过HandPair数据集训练，利用MLLM和手部关键点先验知识，在图像生成和AIGC检测中显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）的细节生成上存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理问题，但手部质量评估被忽视，限制了人本生成质量优化和AIGC检测等下游任务性能。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k高-低质量手部图像对），开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识，并构建人工标注测试集验证。

Result: HandEval比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: HandEval在生成手部质量评估方面表现出色，并在下游应用中具有普遍有效性，为AIGC质量优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI上色技术存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行上色并转售，但目前缺乏有效的防范方法。

Method: 提出Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，使用拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化的输入变换来增强跨模型迁移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低上色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI上色的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度慢，需要数千次模型前向传递才能生成单张图像，效率低下。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token，引导模型走向更稳定的Jacobi轨迹。推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代预测，使用概率标准并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归文本到图像模型推理效率低的问题，实现了并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升生成速度。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 提出一种简单有效的方法：1）使用对抗扰动识别不确定视觉token；2）在视觉编码器的中间层自注意力过程中掩码这些不确定token，抑制其对视觉编码的影响

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有技术协同工作

Conclusion: 视觉编码器中的不确定视觉token是物体幻觉的重要原因，通过识别和掩码这些token可以有效缓解幻觉问题

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

TL;DR: 提出了DGLSS-NL任务，即带噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，通过强-弱分支特征一致性约束和置信度感知过滤，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注常因传感器缺陷、遮挡和人为错误而存在噪声，这种噪声会降低分割精度并在领域偏移时进一步放大，威胁系统可靠性。现有噪声标签学习方法难以直接应用于3D LiDAR数据。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，为LiDAR语义分割中的噪声标签问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

### [41] [Improving the Performance of Unimodal Dynamic Hand-Gesture Recognition with Multimodal Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06145)
*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效的多模态知识迁移方法，通过语义对齐损失和焦点正则化参数，在单模态3D-CNN中嵌入多模态知识，提升动态手势识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常显式组合多模态信息，本文旨在将多模态知识嵌入到单模态网络中，使每个单模态网络都能获得性能提升。

Method: 为每个模态分配独立网络，通过时空语义对齐损失(SSA)对齐不同网络的特征内容，并使用焦点正则化参数避免负知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架提高了单模态网络的测试时识别准确率，并在多个动态手势识别数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功实现了多模态知识向单模态网络的迁移，避免了显式多模态融合，同时提升了单模态网络的性能表现。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit是一个基于状态空间建模的点云法向量估计框架，通过注意力驱动的层次特征融合和补丁级状态空间模型，有效建模细粒度几何结构，提升法向量估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并设计补丁级状态空间模型将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的组件通过消融研究得到验证，能够有效提升点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Method: 构建包含卷积自编码器和全连接层的网络架构，自编码器学习深度特征，中间的全连接层负责寻找稀疏表示，然后利用稀疏编码进行分类。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的实验表明，该方法产生的稀疏表示比现有最先进的SRC方法获得更好的分类结果。

Conclusion: 提出的深度稀疏表示分类网络能够有效结合深度特征学习和稀疏表示，在分类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对多目标跟踪技术提出了迫切需求，但复杂背景、小尺度目标、频繁遮挡等问题挑战现有方法的检测精度和轨迹连续性。

Method: 采用时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协作检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法解决ID切换和轨迹碎片化问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持实时性能的同时，显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了复杂场景下的多目标跟踪挑战。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

*Youwei Zheng,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Xiaohua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将密集的DiT转换为MoE结构，通过结构化稀疏化减少激活参数60%，同时保持原始性能，超越基于剪枝的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但参数量大导致推理开销高。现有压缩方法主要依赖剪枝，但激进剪枝会因模型容量减少导致性能严重下降。

Method: 将DiT中的FFN替换为MoE层，减少FFN激活参数62.5%；提出Mixture of Blocks选择性激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡的知识蒸馏和MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，减少激活参数60%同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过对象中心组合策略生成高质量的合成图像，在检测和视觉定位任务上超越了基于更大真实图像数据集训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模标注数据集成本高昂、存在覆盖偏差且难以扩展，而合成数据通常缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 使用对象中心组合策略，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，利用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和参考表达式。

Result: 在10万张SOS合成图像上训练的模型，在检测和视觉定位任务上优于在更大真实图像数据集（如GRIT的2000万张和V3Det的20万张）上训练的模型，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO视觉定位上提升+8.4 N_Acc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控的数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下都能改善泛化性能，为具有挑战性的类内视觉定位提供有针对性的数据生成能力。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)，通过结合细胞核形态、颜色特征和元数据生成逼真的图像-掩码对，用于增强细胞核分割模型的数据集，显著提升分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中标注数据稀缺，特别是罕见或非典型形态的细胞核分割面临挑战。手动标注成本高昂，合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型，通过水平垂直映射描述细胞核形态、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的元数据，利用多头交叉注意力整合这些异质模态，生成具有精确控制的图像-掩码对。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入Wasserstein距离较低。加入合成样本（如柱状细胞）显著提高了分割模型在柱状细胞上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT是一种可分离的正交变换，通过将DCT径向基和傅里叶谐波角基进行张量积构造，克服了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角度处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出PSepT变换，通过张量积构造离散余弦变换径向基和傅里叶谐波角基，实现完全核分解，支持独立的径向和角度处理。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度降至O(N² log N)，内存需求降至O(N²)，条件数缩放降至O(√N)，在结构化数据集上表现出更好的数值稳定性、计算效率和竞争性分类性能。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架使得之前经典方法无法实现的高阶矩分析成为可能，为鲁棒图像分析应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任度和问责性。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或影响训练样本，作者认为应该同时研究这两个视角。

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域相连接。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能提供细粒度的测试特定解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法无法暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法为深度模型内部工作机制提供了新的见解，能够识别传统方法无法发现的模型行为模式。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统支气管镜导航方法依赖患者CT扫描和额外传感器，设置复杂且成本高。实际手术中精确的度量定位并非必需，拓扑定位已足够辅助外科医生导航

Result: 该方法在真实数据测试序列上表现优异，超越了现有方法

Conclusion: 该图像基拓扑定位方法为支气管镜手术提供了有效的导航辅助，无需患者CT扫描，降低了成本和复杂性

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非类别，但细粒度特性使得大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了其在实际应用中的广泛使用。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化的对象实例，包含不同条件和背景，构建大规模训练集，不依赖任何真实图像。

Result: 在基础视觉模型上使用生成数据进行微调后，在七个跨多个领域的ILR基准测试中检索性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据收集和整理提供了高效有效的替代方案，开创了新的ILR范式，仅需目标领域名称即可实现广泛应用。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，提升自动驾驶等安全关键场景的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测器局限于封闭世界假设，无法处理现实场景中的未知物体。现有开放集检测方法仅将未知物体标记为单一'Unknown'类别，这在安全关键应用中不够实用，需要更细粒度的分类来支持更好的决策。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的物体性建模头、层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督、学习层次关系的分类模块。通过语义层次结构将未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均取得竞争性性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功解决了开放世界目标检测中的细粒度未知物体分类问题，为安全关键应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Result: 重新实现先前文献方法的结果远低于报道值（46.0% vs 96%、55.6% vs 99.2%、57.7% vs 93%），而现代EfficientNet-GRU方法达到92.25%准确率，证明了现代架构和系统优化的价值。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了标准化评估协议在体育视频分析研究中的关键重要性，现代架构结合系统优化能显著提升性能，为可复现研究提供了平台。

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

*Mukilan Karuppasamy,Shankar Gangisetty,Shyam Nandan Rai,Carlo Masone,C V Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DAAD-X数据集和VCBM框架，用于自动驾驶中的可解释驾驶员意图预测，通过多模态数据和概念瓶颈模型生成时空一致的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要，但深度学习系统难以理解环境表示和驾驶任务。

Method: 创建DAAD-X多模态数据集，提出Video Concept Bottleneck Model(VCBM)框架，使用transformer架构生成时空一致的解释，无需后处理技术。

Result: transformer模型比传统CNN模型具有更好的可解释性，提出了多标签t-SNE可视化技术展示解释间的解耦和因果关联。

Conclusion: VCBM框架和DAAD-X数据集为可解释驾驶员意图预测提供了有效解决方案，transformer架构在可解释性方面优于CNN模型。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于CLIP模型的多模态深度学习框架，通过添加时间整合模块和专门的数据增强策略，在牛只行为识别任务中取得了96.1%的准确率，特别是在数据稀缺场景下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康和生产力的重要指标，现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务中存在性能不足的问题，需要开发能够有效利用语义线索的多模态方法。

Method: 基于CLIP大模型进行适配，添加时间整合模块，采用专门的数据增强策略和文本提示来弥合预训练数据与真实监控视频之间的领域差距，在完全监督和少样本学习场景下进行评估。

Result: 在完全监督设置下，Cattle-CLIP在六个行为类别上达到96.1%的总体准确率，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本场景下也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP框架为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决瞬态测量中由于传感器量子效率低和高噪声水平导致的3D重建挑战，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了专门针对时空瞬态测量的注意力机制：时空自注意力编码器通过多尺度特征处理探索局部和全局相关性，时空交叉注意力解码器在token空间整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上的广泛实验表明，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个具体实现均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构在光子效率成像中表现出强大的3D重建能力，同时贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实NLOS测量数据，促进了该领域的数据多样性。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [59] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型主动识别和纠正自身错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减轻累积误差，但仍局限于单一提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。根本挑战在于训练假设（看到干净数据）与测试时自回归现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的关键差异。

Method: 采用错误回收微调，将扩散变换器（DiT）自生成的错误回收为监督提示，通过闭环回收、自回归学习错误注入反馈。具体包括：注入历史错误干预干净输入、单步双向积分近似预测、动态将错误存入重放记忆库。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进水平。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调成功解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐在现代电商平台中至关重要，需要准确捕捉域内和跨域行为模式以提供个性化消费体验。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与项目标识符、文本和视觉特征融合构建增强的项目表示，引入标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签和多注意力集成对面向消费者的推荐系统有益，凸显了LLM在推进智能用户中心服务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病（如冻结肩）的早期准确诊断面临挑战，需要低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出混合运动视频诊断框架HMVDx，使用两个多模态大语言模型分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并提出了基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指数新指标。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中的潜在价值，为未来医学领域视频理解研究做出了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过建立零样本基准测试，系统评估了视觉语言模型在图像隐私预测任务中的表现，发现尽管VLMs资源消耗大，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于专门的小型模型，但在图像扰动鲁棒性方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用通用的大型视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专用模型的性能上限。本文旨在通过公平比较解决这一问题。

Method: 建立零样本图像隐私分类基准，评估排名前三的开源VLMs，使用任务对齐的提示词，并与已有的视觉专用和多模态方法进行性能、效率和鲁棒性对比。

Result: 反直觉地发现，尽管VLMs参数多、推理慢、资源密集，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于专门的小型模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型目前在图像隐私预测任务中尚未超越专门的轻量级模型，但在鲁棒性方面具有优势，这为未来模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Motivation: 解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像问答中容易产生幻觉的问题，提高诊断答案的可靠性。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集评估DSE方法，通过多次采样计算语义熵，过滤高熵问题（DSE > 0.3），重新计算准确率。

Result: 过滤高熵问题后，GPT-4o准确率从51.7%提升到76.3%，GPT-4.1从54.8%提升到63.8%，统计显著。

Conclusion: DSE方法能可靠检测黑盒VLM中的幻觉，显著提高诊断准确性，为临床VLM应用提供有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的采样策略要么依赖手工启发式方法忽略时序线索，要么使用外部关键帧模型增加系统复杂度，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用[FIND]令牌进行关键时刻识别，设计Moment-Centric采样策略密集采样重要时刻，稀疏采样非关键帧，并采用双向锚点更新传播来稳定跟踪。

Conclusion: 该统一框架通过联合优化时序语句定位和参考视频对象分割，提供了一种更有效的方法来处理视频中的语言引导对象分割任务。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法在RLVR优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，需要从token感知的新视角探索多模态RLVR。

Method: 提出VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖性重新加权轨迹优势，并仅在感知关键token上进行策略更新。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅为分析多模态RLVR建立了新的token级感知视角，还提出了一种新颖有效的优化策略来显著增强LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of

TL;DR: 人类视觉注视遵循类似动物觅食的莱维行走模式，通过大规模眼动实验发现人眼以最优效率搜索视觉信息，CNN模型可从图像结构预测注视热点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类视觉注视的时空统计特性，传统模型强调图像显著性但缺乏对眼动动态的深入理解，这对注意力建模和视觉界面有广泛应用

Method: 40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点，分析注视轨迹统计特性，并训练CNN从图像预测注视热点图

Result: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循莱维行走模式，类似于动物觅食行为；CNN模型能够准确预测新图像的显著注视区域

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似自然觅食的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: CapGeo是一个通过几何图形描述辅助多模态大语言模型进行几何推理的框架，显著提升了模型在几何问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁的文本描述，将视觉内容转换为描述文本是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 提出CapGeo框架，通过几何图形描述辅助推理，将视觉和文本模态连接起来。同时构建CapGeo-Bench数据集（4,641个图形-描述对）和基于关键点的评估指标来系统评估几何描述模型。

Result: 使用描述辅助后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。提出的评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径，证明了通过几何描述连接视觉和文本模态的有效性。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在无线电地图生成中的模型尺寸大、迭代去噪慢、推理延迟高的问题，实现实时部署。

Method: 提出流匹配框架，学习噪声与数据之间的连续传输轨迹，实现单步高效采样。

Result: 在保持重建精度的同时，参数减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来提升自监督单目深度估计性能，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而遇到性能限制，需要更有效地整合视觉先验和上下文信息。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 基于粗特征整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE流程集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中显著优于最先进方法的所有指标，同时有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net用于病理图像中的半监督细胞核实例分割，通过实例感知一致性正则化和形态学先验知识来提升分割精度，特别是在密集分布和重叠细胞核场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺，现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化不足，缺乏病理结构先验知识利用，且训练中容易引入噪声伪标签。

Method: 提出IRCR-Net网络，包含匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，利用细胞核形态学先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签并增强高质量预测。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个公共数据集上显著提升了半监督细胞核实例分割性能，在某些场景下甚至超越了全监督方法。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和形态学先验知识的有效结合，成功解决了半监督细胞核分割中的关键挑战，为病理图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于热红外图像增强的渐进式提示融合网络（PPFN），通过建立基于热成像过程的提示对来调制模型特征，能够有效处理单一或复合退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异，在红外图像上效果有限。

Method: PPFN网络基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过融合对应提示对来调制模型特征；引入选择性渐进训练机制逐步优化模型对复合情况的处理。

Result: 该方法不仅在特定退化条件下提供良好视觉效果，在复杂退化场景下性能显著提升8.76%，能够去除相机噪声、保留关键结构细节并增强热图像整体对比度。

Conclusion: PPFN方法有效解决了热红外图像增强中的耦合退化问题，建立了高质量多场景红外基准，为热红外图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出利用视觉语言模型进行多模态关键词预测，通过零样本、监督微调、Fine-tune-CoT和动态CoT策略提升模型性能，解决了传统多模态方法在缺失和未见场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态方法在处理缺失和未见场景时存在显著局限性，现有基准测试因训练测试重叠度高而高估模型能力，需要更有效的方法来提升多模态关键词预测性能。

Method: 1) 使用零样本和监督微调评估VLM性能下限；2) 采用Fine-tune-CoT利用教师模型生成的高质量推理数据微调小模型；3) 提出动态CoT策略，在训练中自适应注入CoT数据，使模型在推理阶段灵活运用推理能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法具有有效性，动态CoT策略能够解决"过度思考"现象。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型和创新的CoT策略，可以有效提升多模态关键词预测的性能，特别是在复杂推理场景下。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心的推理基准，专注于挑战性感知任务，要求模型仅从视觉内容进行推理，超越了浅层感知，需要细粒度观察和分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，作者创建了一个基于视觉内容的推理基准，将重点从基于语言的推理转向基于图像的推理。

Method: BLINK-Twice整合了三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型用于测试视觉推理、自然对抗图像对强制依赖视觉内容、带注释的推理链用于细粒度评估推理过程。评估了20个领先的MLLM模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成了重大挑战。现有的语言空间推理策略如思维链或自我批评可以提高性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。重复图像观察提高了模型性能，主动视觉交互显示了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: 该基准突出了当前MLLM在视觉推理方面的局限性，并表明需要开发新的视觉推理范式，特别是结合主动视觉交互的方法。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

TL;DR: VAD-GS是一个针对挑战性城市场景的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过体素化可见性推理、多样性感知视图选择和基于块匹配的多视图立体重建来恢复缺失的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的性能严重依赖于初始点云质量，但在无边界动态城市场景中，由于观察视锥体不重叠，往往导致点云覆盖不均匀不完整，训练时会产生扭曲和伪影。现有致密化策略无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 通过体素化可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构，通过多样性感知视图选择信息丰富的支持视图，通过基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构，生成由可靠几何先验引导的新高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS能够有效解决3D高斯泼溅在城市场景中的几何恢复问题，即使在缺乏初始点的区域也能生成可靠的高斯基元。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 准确量化森林生物量对碳循环监测至关重要，但直接从LiDAR点云估计木质体积和地上生物量具有挑战性，因为难以建模区分树木所需的长程依赖关系。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖关系以改进树木区分，并加入跳跃连接增强特征和加速收敛。

Result: 在丹麦国家森林清单LiDAR数据上的评估显示，Minkowski-MambaNet显著优于最先进方法，提供更准确和稳健的估计。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清单技术。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

TL;DR: 提出了两种无需重新训练即可利用DETR中MLP层稀疏性的方法：静态指示器稀疏化(SIBS)和微门控稀疏化(MGS)，其中MGS通过轻量级门控机制实现85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在视觉任务中推理效率低，特别是在对象检测等任务中。DETR的MLP层存在固有的稀疏性，但现有方法未能有效利用这一特性。

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持或提升性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，使得无需完整模型重新训练即可高效部署预训练的视觉transformer。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景基于文本提示进行编辑在内容创作和虚拟环境中有广泛应用，但面临在复杂动态场景中实现语义精确编辑同时保持未编辑内容完整性的挑战。

Method: 方法包括：1）用量化CLIP特征增强3D高斯形成语言嵌入动态表示；2）两阶段点级定位策略（CLIP相似度候选选择+空间范围精炼）；3）使用基于扩散的视频编辑模型进行针对性编辑，通过流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor为4D场景编辑提供了一个灵活准确的框架，成功解决了复杂动态场景中语义精确编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过有效利用短期和长期时间线索，在低光视频增强中取得了显著效果，特别是在噪声抑制和细节保持方面表现优异。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SilvaScenes数据集，用于森林环境中树木实例分割和物种分类，包含1476棵树、24个物种的标注数据，展示了树木分割相对容易但物种分类仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注城市环境或有限物种，无法满足复杂自然森林环境中精确林业、生物多样性监测和林业设备自动化所需的感知系统开发需求。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克五个生物气候区域收集林冠下图像，由林业专家标注1476棵树、24个物种，建立SilvaScenes数据集，并基于现代深度学习实例分割方法进行基准测试。

Result: 树木分割表现良好，最高平均精度达67.65%，但物种分类仍然困难，平均精度仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境感知研究的空白，为开发复杂自然环境中树木检测和物种分类系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布来缓解对比视觉语言模型中主导维度的影响，改善测试时提示调优的校准性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现对比视觉语言模型中存在由跨模态单一主导特征维度引起的模态间隙问题，这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差

Method: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋向均匀分布，从而减轻对主导维度的依赖

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化问题

Conclusion: 为增强视觉语言模型在现实部署场景中的可靠性提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DreamBooth的多令牌策略，结合LoRA参数高效微调，解决从少量参考角色生成无限新角色同时保持艺术风格的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动画和游戏行业需要生成大量新颖角色同时保持特定艺术风格和视觉特征的挑战，特别是在只有少量参考角色的情况下。

Method: 基于DreamBooth微调文本到图像扩散模型，采用多令牌策略（通过聚类为单个角色和集体风格分配独立令牌），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机令牌和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上的评估显示，该方法能生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征，人类评估进一步证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现无限角色创建同时保持学习到的风格，在动画、游戏等领域具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 当前医学图像交互式分割评估方法不一致且不切合临床实际，阻碍了公平比较和真实性能评估。

Method: 提出临床基础的评估任务和指标定义方法，构建标准化评估框架，对最先进算法在异构复杂任务上进行评估。

Result: 发现最小化交互信息损失对模型鲁棒性至关重要；自适应缩放机制提升鲁棒性和收敛速度；验证提示行为/预算与训练不一致会导致性能下降；2D方法在板状图像和粗粒度目标上表现良好，3D上下文有助于处理大型或不规则目标；非医学领域模型在对比度差和复杂形状下性能下降。

Conclusion: 建立标准化临床评估框架对公平比较交互式分割算法至关重要，揭示了关键设计因素对性能的影响，为未来算法开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench是首个评估多模态大语言模型对物理工具理解能力的基准，包含三个难度级别：工具识别、工具理解和工具创造，涵盖1000多个图像-文本对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化MLLMs对物理工具的真实理解程度，因为工具使用是人类智能的标志，对通用智能体实现真正多功能性至关重要。

Method: 构建视觉问答数据集，评估32个MLLMs在三个难度级别上的表现：工具识别（识别主要功能）、工具理解（理解操作原理）、工具创造（用周围物体创造新工具）。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，提供了深入分析和初步解决方案。

Conclusion: MLLMs在物理工具理解方面仍有不足，PhysToolBench为评估和改进这一能力提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影及其对PRNU相机溯源验证的影响，探索在无法获取RAW图像情况下的解决方案。

Method: 分析多个三星Galaxy S和A系列模型的图像伪影模式，比较RAW图像和JPEG图像在PRNU验证中的表现差异。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S系列模型存在共同的伪影模式导致指纹碰撞，A系列也有类似问题；RAW图像可绕过引入伪影的处理流程，实现可靠PRNU验证。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影会影响PRNU验证，但支持RAW拍摄的设备仍可进行可靠验证；这些伪影在减少HDR图像误检和定位人像模式合成虚化区域方面具有法证应用价值。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小物体表示，在计算约束下实现了优于现有方法的精度-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航空图像中小物体检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节常偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含两个模块：渐进细化颈部(PRN)通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐；增强切片采样(ESSamp)通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的大量实验表明，PRNet在可比较的计算约束下优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征，成功增强了小物体表示，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

TL;DR: FLOWING是一个基于微分向量流的变形框架，通过将变形建模为流构造来确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性，在2D图像和3D形状变形中实现了最先进的变形质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多层感知机(MLP)作为隐式神经表示(INR)进行变形建模时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且难以有效对齐特征。

Method: 将变形重新定义为微分向量流的构造，将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Result: 在面部和图像变形以及高斯溅射变形等多种应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的方法能够产生原则性且稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA提出了一种动态参数化控制方法，通过超网络实时生成LoRA适配器来调节扩散模型权重，相比静态激活修改方法显著提升了生成质量和空间条件遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控扩散模型采用固定架构，在中间激活层注入条件指导，这种静态条件策略无法适应多阶段去噪过程的动态特性，限制了模型从粗结构到细细节的适应能力。

Method: 使用超网络根据时间和用户条件实时生成LoRA适配器，直接调节冻结骨干网络的权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。

Result: 在多个数据领域的实验中，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种新范式，通过权重的深度功能适配来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

TL;DR: FSP-DETR是一个统一的生物医学检测框架，能够在单一模型中实现少样本检测、开放集识别和跨任务泛化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的挑战，需要能够处理少样本、开放集和跨任务场景的鲁棒检测方法。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 在虫卵、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR在少样本和开放集场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的检测框架，支持推理时的灵活性，能够识别未见类别、拒绝背景和跨任务适应，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型虽然提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，但从头训练成本高昂。需要一种高效的方法来为预训练视觉语言模型添加动作能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小动作模型的动作空间；2）选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。添加动作令牌和状态编码器来整合物理输入。

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%）。真实世界实验中在5个操作任务上达到82.0%成功率（提升17%）。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法能有效让视觉语言模型生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在仿真和真实世界任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Method: 提出统一框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存（重用注意力汇聚点、近期视觉token和文本token），通过简单的监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，以66.18%的胜率击败GPT-4O mini，在单张H100上实现高达8FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM实现了对无限视觉输入的实时稳定理解，其训练策略不仅提升了流式处理能力，还增强了通用视觉问答能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

### [94] [Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition using GLiNER-BioMed with Targeted Dictionary-Based Post-processing for BioASQ 2025 task 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08588)
*Ritesh Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioASQ数据集上的表现，引入基于词典的后处理策略来解决常见误分类问题。后处理在开发集上显著提升性能（F1从0.79到0.83），但在盲测集上未能泛化（F1从0.79降至0.77）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学命名实体识别中相似实体类型（如基因和化学物质）难以区分的问题，提升模型在实际应用中的准确性。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来修正常见误分类，同时探索了条件随机场等替代方法。

Result: 后处理在开发集上显著提升性能（微F1从0.79到0.83），但在盲测集上性能下降（微F1从0.79到0.77），表明存在过拟合开发数据的问题。

Conclusion: 基于词典的细化方法对预训练BioNER模型有潜力，但关键挑战在于避免过拟合开发数据并确保在真实场景中的鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时缩放(TTS)方法存在一个未被识别的失败模式：当候选回答多样性受限时，即使只是适度减少，TTS产生不安全输出的概率会显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示TTS方法中关于候选多样性增强可靠性的假设存在缺陷，当多样性受限时会引入安全风险。

Method: 提出RefDiv参考引导多样性减少协议作为诊断攻击，在四个开源模型和两种TTS策略上进行广泛实验，测试多样性约束对安全性的影响。

Result: 多样性约束显著增加了TTS产生不安全结果的比率，这种效应比高对抗意图提示更强，且在不同TTS策略和闭源模型中都存在。现有安全防护分类器无法检测RefDiv生成的对抗性输入。

Conclusion: TTS存在基于多样性的通用失败模式，需要设计既能有效又能抵御多样性针对性压力测试的鲁棒TTS策略。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HAREN-CTC架构，通过多层次SSL特征整合和跨注意力机制，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督，在语音抑郁检测任务中取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁检测方法主要依赖SSL模型的单一层特征，难以捕捉稀疏、异质的抑郁线索，且容易过拟合特定数据集。

Method: HAREN-CTC包含层次自适应聚类模块重组SSL特征，跨模态融合模块通过跨注意力建模层间依赖，结合CTC损失实现对齐感知训练。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上分别达到0.81和0.82的宏F1分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过有效整合多层次SSL特征和CTC时间建模，显著提升了语音抑郁检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型数学理解程度的核心问题，超越标准基准测试，诊断具体的推理失败点。

Method: 首先让GPT-3.5在GSM8K数据集上生成结构化推理步骤，然后使用GPT-4o-mini对错误进行分类，并通过无监督聚类识别出现的"推理模式"。

Result: 揭示了AI模型认知特征的非人类化脆弱性：在顺序计算等程序性模式上表现近乎完美，但在需要组合推理的限制性模式上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 通过识别和量化不同推理技能的可靠性，为评估数学理解提供了更细粒度的方法，并为开发新能力和更可靠的未来应用提供了精确路线图。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [98] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出置信度分数(CS)作为替代无参考指标的方案，缓解传统指标对创意文本生成的偏见，在GPT-4o-mini实验中显示CS在19%的情况下偏好新颖回答，而流畅度指标为0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无参考指标如自困惑度对创意文本生成存在强烈偏见，需要更平衡的评估方法。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布中推导置信度分数(CS)，在99个创意提示上对比CS与流畅度指标的表现。

Result: CS在19%的情况下偏好新颖回答，而流畅度指标为0%，差异具有统计显著性(95%置信区间[11.1%, 27.3%])。CS还能有效区分不同难度任务。

Conclusion: 置信度分数缓解了传统指标的创造力偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLM提供更平衡的评估。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recover-LoRA是一种轻量级、数据集无关的方法，通过使用合成数据和logit蒸馏学习选择性层的LoRA适配器，从模型权重退化中恢复语言模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化（如量化、剪枝、格式转换等）会导致语言模型性能下降，现有研究主要关注量化鲁棒性，而本文关注从各种模型权重退化源中恢复精度。

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏，在选择性层上学习LoRA适配器，将退化模型与其全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在多种小型语言模型（包括MHA和GQA注意力架构）上，Recover-LoRA能够恢复5-17%的模型精度。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA提供了一种有效的方法来从各种模型权重退化中恢复语言模型性能。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一个受人类记忆启发的无监督长期记忆架构，专为边缘设备上的LLM设计，通过图结构存储、记忆过滤和概率回忆机制，在纵向医疗对话中表现出优越的长期记忆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆系统依赖暴力上下文扩展或静态检索管道，无法在边缘设备上有效处理纵向对话，特别是在医疗等需要长期记忆的领域。

Method: 使用图结构存储、模块化内容和冗余过滤器、记忆提交和修剪机制，以及基于人类记忆模型的概率回忆与时间衰减刷新过程，还包括从记忆图中提取的浓缩核心摘要。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话盲测中，Mnemosyne获得65.8%的胜率，远超基线RAG的31.1%；在LoCoMo基准测试中，在时间推理和单跳检索方面达到最高分，总体得分54.6%排名第二。

Conclusion: Mnemosyne证明通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督记忆架构，可以实现改进的事实回忆、增强的时间推理和更自然的用户响应。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

TL;DR: 将AI生成文本检测任务重新定义为离群检测问题，将人类文本视为分布外样本，机器生成文本视为分布内样本，使用单类学习和基于分数的方法实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将AI文本检测视为二元分类问题，但人类文本实际上不构成统一分布，这种错误假设导致模型泛化能力差，只能记忆观察到的分布外特征而非学习'非分布内'行为的本质。

Method: 提出基于离群检测的框架，使用单类学习方法（DeepSVDD和HRN）和基于分数的学习技术（如基于能量的方法），将人类文本视为分布外样本，机器文本视为分布内样本。

Result: 在DeepFake数据集上达到98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，FPR95仅为8.9%。在多语言、受攻击、未见模型和领域文本设置下均表现出鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 将AI文本检测重新定义为离群检测问题比传统二元分类方法更有效，能够更好地处理人类文本的多样性，实现更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

TL;DR: YpathRAG是一个病理学导向的RAG框架，通过双通道混合检索和证据判断模块，在病理学领域显著提高了检索质量和事实可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务表现出色，但在病理学等高门槛领域仍存在幻觉问题。现有方法依赖领域微调，但无法扩展知识边界或实施证据约束。

Method: 构建包含28个子领域和153万段落的病理学向量数据库；开发双通道混合检索（BGE-M3密集检索+词汇引导稀疏检索）；基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块，形成检索-判断-生成闭环。

Result: 在YpathR基准上，Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提高23个百分点；在YpathQA-M（300个最具挑战性问题）上，通用和医疗LLM准确率平均提高9.0%，最高提升15.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了检索质量和事实可靠性，为病理学导向的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

Motivation: 现有越狱攻击通常通过添加高困惑度对抗后缀或长模板来解锁模型响应，但这些攻击容易被基于困惑度的过滤机制检测到。

Method: LatentBreak通过最小化对抗性提示与无害请求在潜在空间中表示的距离，选择语义等效词替换输入提示中的词汇，保持提示初始意图的同时降低困惑度。

Result: 广泛评估表明，LatentBreak生成的提示更短、困惑度更低，在多个安全对齐模型上对基于困惑度的过滤器表现优于竞争越狱算法。

Conclusion: LatentBreak是一种有效的白盒越狱攻击方法，能够生成自然、低困惑度的对抗性提示，成功规避基于困惑度的防御机制。

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Method: 检测文本、音频、视频中的逐话语热点，通过热点门控融合与全局特征结合，使用路由混合对齐器对齐模态，构建跨模态图编码对话结构

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中相比强基线获得一致提升，消融实验验证了HGF和MoA的有效性

Conclusion: 热点中心视角可为未来多模态学习提供新思路，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新视角

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

Method: 构建包含8个亚洲国家、10种语言的27,000道多选题基准数据集，支持文本、图像和语音三种模态对齐输入；提出五维评估协议和Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module检测捷径学习。

Result: 创建了首个在输入层面对齐三种模态的数据集，79%的问题需要基于文化背景的多步推理；通过比较模型分析、注意力追踪和VPR方法揭示了模型在不同语言和模态间的差异原因。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建文化可靠的多模态大语言模型提供了可操作的见解，填补了亚洲文化背景下模型评估的空白。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphGhost是一个统一的框架，将神经元激活及其信号传播表示为图，用于解释LLMs如何从序列输入中捕获结构语义并通过结构一致的机制生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 引入GraphGhost框架，将神经元激活和信号传播建模为图，应用PageRank等图算法分析LLMs特性，并通过结构干预评估关键神经元节点。

Result: 揭示了跨不同数据集的共享和模型特定的推理行为，证明对关键神经元节点的编辑会引发推理崩溃，改变逻辑流程和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预和理解LLMs推理结构基础的有力工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在医疗诊断中对患者性别相关性的判断存在不一致性，特别是在性别相关性判断方面，这可能导致临床实践中的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用日益广泛，但其对性别偏见的敏感性可能影响临床决策的可靠性，需要评估LLMs是否会复制或放大与性别相关的偏见。

Method: 使用新英格兰医学杂志挑战赛的案例研究，为多个开源和专有LLMs分配性别（女性、男性或未指定），评估它们在LLM性别分配下的诊断一致性以及对患者性别相关性和必要性的判断。

Result: 大多数模型在诊断方面相对一致，但在患者性别相关性和必要性判断方面，所有模型都表现出显著的不一致性，特别是在相关性判断方面。某些模型在解释患者性别时甚至显示出系统性的女性-男性差异。

Conclusion: 这种未被充分探索的偏见可能削弱LLMs在临床实践中的可靠性，强调需要定期检查与LLMs交互时的身份分配一致性，以确保可靠和公平的AI支持临床护理。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个利用大语言模型自动生成数学应用题中干扰条件的迭代框架，旨在创建更可信的基准测试数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集大多只包含必要信息，缺乏干扰条件，导致大语言模型在真实场景中的推理能力评估不够准确。现有干扰条件数据集存在难度低、上下文不相关等问题。

Method: 设计了一个迭代框架，使用LLM从多个视角和认知层面修订数学应用题，自动生成有意义的干扰条件，同时保持原始问题的解决方案不变。

Result: 该框架能够高效生成高质量的干扰条件数学应用题，大幅减少了人工检查重写解决方案的工作量。

Conclusion: 提出的自动生成干扰条件框架解决了现有数据集的局限性，为大语言模型数学推理能力的更可靠评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过重述基准问题来探测LLM泛化能力的简单方法，发现模型在重述版本上的准确率显著下降，表明存在测试数据记忆和表面形式捷径问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的基准分数可能因记忆测试项目或其近似重复项而被夸大，需要评估模型在重述问题上的泛化能力。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上测量原始问题和重述问题之间的准确率差距，采用控制解码、强制多选题输出格式和鲁棒的重述清理步骤。

Result: 重述导致准确率显著下降（原始vs重述），与先前关于数据污染和脆弱的表面形式捷径的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 基准测试中的重述评估揭示了LLM对表面形式的依赖，强调了需要更严格的泛化评估方法。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心语言模型，采用上扩增策略从较小的高性能英语模型扩展参数空间，专门集成泰语知识，在泰语基准测试中表现优于Typhoon2-70B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型主要依赖开源模型进行额外训练，这可能导致原有知识被侵蚀，因为通用任务的优化参数可能与新语言需求冲突。JAI-1旨在通过上扩增策略解决这一问题。

Method: 从较小的英语开源LLM开始，扩展参数空间，利用新增容量系统集成泰语知识。预训练使用1.5万亿token（含3000亿泰语token），随后进行监督微调和对齐调优，使用超过60万指令示例。

Result: 在泰语中心基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）中表现优于Typhoon2-70B，验证了其上扩增和知识集成框架的有效性。

Conclusion: JAI-1的上扩增方法不仅保留了原始模型的通用智能，还建立了独特的架构，支持未来可扩展的增强，为泰语语言模型开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于用户画像（年龄、性别、职业）的销售导向对话代理，发现职业对对话意图影响最大，并提出了一种轻量级的职业条件策略来优化对话效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能对话模型的快速发展，需要真实用户模拟研究来优化有效的对话策略。本文旨在探索销售导向代理如何根据用户画像调整对话策略。

Method: 引入轻量级的职业条件策略，引导代理优先选择与用户偏好一致的对话意图，从而缩短对话长度并提高成功率。

Result: 研究发现年龄和性别影响整体性能，但职业对对话意图产生最显著差异。采用职业条件策略后，对话更短且更成功。

Conclusion: 研究强调了丰富模拟器配置文件的重要性，并展示了简单基于人物画像的策略可以提升销售导向对话系统的有效性。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Text2Stories任务和指标，用于量化需求（用户故事）与利益相关者实际需求之间的对齐程度，包括正确性和完整性两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM可以自动从自然语言输入生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否真实反映利益相关者需求仍然主要依赖人工。需要一种可量化的方法来评估需求与原始访谈内容的对齐程度。

Method: 将访谈记录分割为文本块，将对齐问题建模为文本块与用户故事之间的匹配问题。使用基于LLM的匹配器来评估对齐程度，包括正确性（故事被记录支持的比例）和完整性（记录被故事覆盖的比例）。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86的宏F1分数，而仅使用嵌入模型效果较差但可用于有效阻塞。

Conclusion: Text2Stories指标能够比较不同故事集（如人工生成与自动生成），作为现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、忠实于源头的补充评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

TL;DR: PARSE系统通过自动优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升了从非结构化文本中提取结构化信息的准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将JSON模式视为静态合约，导致提取性能不佳、幻觉频繁和代理行为不可靠，需要能够解释和系统改进模式的方法

Method: 开发PARSE系统，包含ARCHITECT组件（自动优化JSON模式）和SCOPE组件（基于反射的提取方法，结合静态和LLM防护机制）

Result: 在SWDE数据集上提取准确率提升64.7%，整体框架改进达10%，首次重试时提取错误减少92%，同时保持实用延迟

Conclusion: PARSE通过协同优化模式设计和提取过程，显著改善了LLM在结构化信息提取中的性能和可靠性

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Motivation: 调查评估导向的提示框架是否夸大了大语言模型的性能测量，而实际部署需要简洁、合同约束的答案。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS-20B模型进行六组A/B场景测试，保持任务内容和解码固定，仅改变框架（评估导向vs真实世界）和推理深度，通过确定性验证器计算准确性、合规性等指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加了推理链长度，降低了仅回答合规性，但准确率提升有限或不一致。激励措辞会重新分配错误组成，多语言标题会重现这些特征。

Conclusion: 需要采用中性措辞、双重框架检查、合同感知评分等方法来确保基准测试的增益反映可部署能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理成本高，小型语言模型在推荐系统中的推理能力未被充分探索，现有系统未能充分利用自然语言推理文本作为学习信号。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，将SLM生成的推理文本作为直接学习信号，通过交互历史进行监督，共同建模用户行为（what）及其语义驱动因素（why）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于领先的ID、协同过滤和基于LLM的序列推荐模型，在跨域推荐中表现出优越的迁移性，在推理导向问答任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: PULSE通过将推理文本作为一等公民信号，生成了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入，为高效且有效的推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法多为直接检测，仅提供二元预测，缺乏上下文和解释。最近的解释-检测方法性能不如简单SFT基线，且存在政策相关线索未被假设、二元奖励信号不足指导推理的问题。

Method: ExPO-HM方法结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵(CDE)作为推理质量的度量和奖励，模仿人类标注者的训练和评估过程。

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面达到最先进性能，相比GRPO和DPO基线分别提升15%和17% F1分数。

Conclusion: ExPO-HM将仇恨表情包检测从简单二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，提供准确、可解释且可操作的审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型在语义层次建模方面存在局限，需要一种能够处理不同语义粒度的通用框架。

Method: 构建分层词汇表，前向过程将token扰动到更高层次的抽象语义，反向过程逐步预测更详细的语义，实现时间变化的下一语义尺度预测。

Result: 在文本生成实验中，HDLM相比基线模型展现出更低的验证困惑度和生成困惑度。

Conclusion: HDLM提供了一个通用的分层扩散语言建模框架，能够有效处理不同语义粒度的语言生成任务。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

TL;DR: UCoT是一种高效的推理框架，通过前期思想嵌入实现CoT压缩，使用小模型作为压缩器和大模型作为执行器的协作工作流，显著减少推理长度同时保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链式思维推理在LLMs中计算成本高、延迟大，现有CoT压缩方法要么需要繁琐的离散提示设计，要么构建外部压缩数据集但牺牲关键推理细节。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段训练压缩器生成富含推理信息的前期思想嵌入；第二阶段优化执行器利用这些嵌入进行短推理，采用奖励机制。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，UCoT将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的token使用量减少50%，性能比SOTA方法提高3.08%。

Conclusion: UCoT在保持强大推理能力的同时显著减少CoT长度，实现了高效的推理压缩。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

### [120] [Formalizing Style in Personal Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08649)
*Gustave Cortal,Alain Finkel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析个人叙事风格的正式框架，通过整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取语言特征，并在梦境叙事中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人叙事是作者构建意义的重要方式，风格对传达主观体验至关重要，但目前缺乏系统分析这些风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取过程、参与者和环境等语言特征，分析序列模式。

Result: 在数百个梦境叙事中应用该框架，包括对患有创伤后应激障碍的战争退伍军人的案例研究，发现其叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 该框架成功揭示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系，为系统分析个人叙事风格提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用LLM处理定性文本数据，结合传统评分量表创建增强型心理测试，在抑郁症评估案例中显著提高了测量精度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估主要依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富信息，需要开发能整合定性数据的新方法。

Method: 开发了一个结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目的增强测试框架，在真实世界高中生样本(n=693)和合成数据集(n=3,000)上进行验证，基于项目信息计算经验性地选择最具信息量的LLM评分指令。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面实现了统计学显著改进。LLM项目的信息增益相当于为原始19项测试增加了6.3(真实数据)至16.0(合成数据)个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展的方法，利用日益增长的转录文本数据来增强传统心理测量工具，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个高效可扩展的扩散式大语言模型推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现了显著的推理速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)作为一种有前景的自回归模型替代方案，但由于缺乏标准化和高效的推理框架，其广泛应用受到限制。

Method: 将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件：模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略和KV缓存管理器，并结合新颖算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，HumanEval基准测试中达到1100+ tokens/秒，六个基准测试平均超过800 tokens/秒；相比Fast-dLLM实现10倍加速，相比优化后的自回归模型QWen2.5-3B仍有2-3倍速度优势。

Conclusion: dInfer通过算法创新和系统优化的结合，为扩散式大语言模型提供了高效推理解决方案，显著提升了推理效率而不损失输出质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首次对代码语言模型进行大规模缩放定律研究，发现代码比自然语言更数据饥渴，需要更高的数据参数比，且Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律主要基于自然语言分析，但代码与自然语言在严格语法等方面存在根本差异，不清楚这些定律是否适用于代码。

Method: 进行117次实验，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练token从2B到128B，拟合Chinchilla定律和Farseer定律，并进行代码-自然语言混合实验。

Result: 代码语言模型能有效随模型规模扩展，但代码比自然语言更数据饥渴，需要更高的数据参数比；Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确；自然语言在资源受限时有益，但在高计算预算时成为不利因素。

Conclusion: 代码语言模型的缩放定律与自然语言不同，需要专门的研究和优化策略，特别是在数据需求方面。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个三阶段推理框架来分析LLM在法律案例推理中的能力，发现模型在表面推理表现良好，但在层次推理和综合分析中性能显著下降，且错误回答消耗更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在复杂、细致的法律案例推理中的能力，特别是类比和区分先例的能力，这在法律实践中至关重要。

Method: 提出一个正式框架，将案例区分过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用事实谓词（因素）建模案例，组织成法律知识层次结构，并定义可验证的区分识别规则。

Result: LLM在表面推理（任务1）准确率高，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）和综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）中性能显著下降。模型在错误回答上消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: LLM在法律推理领域存在根本性限制，"思考更久"不等于"思考更聪明"，需要解决这些限制才能实现稳健可信的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM生成测试用例的基准存在高计算成本、分数膨胀和偏向简单错误而非关键故障的问题，需要一种更有效的评估方法。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为在二进制代码-测试矩阵中寻找最优诊断基础的问题，提出WrongSelect算法来选择最大多样性的错误代码，构建TC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑、多样且抗分数膨胀的基准，有效评估测试用例生成方法的诊断能力，揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Luoberta/TC-Bench and our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现微基准测试在模型排名一致性方面存在局限性，即使模型性能差异达到3.5-4个准确率点，现有方法也无法可靠排名，需要250个样本才能获得一致结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中全基准测试时间成本过高的问题，探究微基准测试能否替代全基准测试来一致地排名模型。

Method: 引入元评估方法，分析微基准在不同模型性能差异下的排名能力，比较不同样本大小下随机抽样与现有微基准方法的性能。

Result: 现有微基准方法在样本量较小时（如25个样本）无法可靠排名模型，超过50%的成对比较结果不可靠；需要250个样本时随机抽样才具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在效率与可靠性之间存在权衡，需要谨慎选择样本大小，为微基准用户和开发者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Motivation: 地理编码是将位置引用链接到实际地理位置的任务，对非结构化文本的下游分析至关重要。本文特别关注组合位置引用的地理编码这一具有挑战性的场景。

Method: 基于LLM在空间数据推理能力的最新研究成果，评估LLM的地理空间知识与任务相关推理技能，并据此提出基于LLM的组合位置引用地理编码策略。

Result: 研究表明，该方法提高了地理编码任务的性能，且相对较小的微调LLM能够达到与大型现成模型相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: LLM在组合位置引用地理编码任务中表现出色，通过适当的策略设计，较小规模的微调模型也能实现与大型模型相当的效果，为实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM在全球多语言环境中的广泛应用，需要理解和保护其多语言响应，确保在不同语言和文化背景下的准确性和安全性。

Method: 使用五点评分标准和法官LLM，在五个维度上评估模型在低资源和高资源语言中的响应。

Result: GPT-5在所有类别中平均表现最佳，特别是在同意与自主权（3.56）和伤害预防与安全（4.73）类别中得分最高，而Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最差（1.39和1.98）。

Conclusion: 需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别中的响应，并改进这些领域的表现。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention方法，通过概率性、分层token选择机制，在严格全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，解决Transformer注意力O(n²)复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力随序列长度呈二次方增长O(n²)，限制了长上下文应用。需要一种高效的方法来减少计算和内存开销。

Method: 使用Bernoulli门通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛进行训练，在推理时采用简单的top-M规则，实现可微分的标准编码器替换方案。

Result: 在分类、抽取式问答和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的token即可保持≥95%的完整模型性能，峰值内存减少约35-45%，吞吐量提升约1.8倍。

Conclusion: 这种架构无关的方法在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，为长上下文应用提供了实用的效率提升。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型语言模型的全面评估在通用中文语境下研究不足，需要构建专门的中文基准来评估模型整合中文特定事实知识与多步逻辑推理的能力。

Method: 首先从现有QA数据集中构建领域平衡的种子集，然后开发基于LLM的流水线生成基于事实单元链的多跳问题，并实施人工参与的验证系统确保数据质量。

Result: 评估显示最先进的LLMs在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面存在持续局限性，检索增强生成显著缓解了这些知识差距，带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: CCMOR基准揭示了LLMs在中文语境下知识推理的局限性，检索增强是有效的改进方法，为未来中文语言模型的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

Motivation: 科学编程任务需要严谨的算法、深厚的领域知识和特定领域的推理，而现有方法在处理需要分解为子问题的复杂科学任务时存在局限性。

Method: 采用无训练的多智能体框架，包含专门设计的智能体进行自我反思、创建推理、编码和调试，结合学生-教师范式和统一上下文窗口来减少幻觉。

Result: 在科学编程基准测试中，MOSAIC在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSAIC框架通过多智能体协作和专门设计的工作流程，有效解决了科学编程中的复杂挑战，为科学计算提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言结构对LLM隐私泄露的影响，发现在英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语的医疗语料训练中，隐私漏洞与语言冗余度和分词粒度相关，意大利语泄露最强，英语成员推断分离性更高，法语和西班牙语因形态复杂性更具韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多语言应用中处理敏感数据时存在隐私风险，但现有研究主要关注英语，需要探究语言结构如何影响隐私泄露。

Method: 量化六个语言指标，评估三种攻击向量：提取、反事实记忆和成员推断，使用英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语的医疗语料训练LLM。

Result: 隐私漏洞随语言冗余度和分词粒度增加而增加：意大利语泄露最强，英语成员推断分离性更高，法语和西班牙语因形态复杂性更具韧性。

Conclusion: 语言结构确实影响隐私泄露，强调了在LLM部署中需要语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

*Jia Ao Sun,Hao Yu,Fabrizio Gotti,Fengran Mo,Yihong Wu,Yuchen Hui,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Search-on-Graph（SoG）框架，让LLM能够在知识图谱上进行迭代式导航，通过观察当前实体的可用关系来决定下一步跳转，解决了传统KGQA方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法面临基本权衡：完整SPARQL查询在不知道可用关系时很脆弱，检索大子图会引入噪声，复杂代理框架会指数级扩大搜索空间。LLM在知识密集型多跳问题上不可靠，会遗漏长尾事实、产生幻觉且知识滞后。

Method: SoG框架采用"观察-然后-导航"原则，让LLM使用单个精心设计的搜索函数进行迭代式图导航。在每个步骤中，LLM检查当前实体的实际可用关系，然后决定下一跳，无需预先规划路径或检索大子图。

Result: 在六个KGQA基准测试（涵盖Freebase和Wikidata）上，SoG实现了最先进的性能，无需微调。在Wikidata基准上表现尤为突出（比之前最佳方法提升16%），在Freebase基准上也有一致改进。

Conclusion: SoG是一个简单而有效的框架，能够无缝适应不同的KG模式，通过自适应过滤处理高度节点，显著提升了KGQA的性能。

yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PE-CoA框架，使用五种对话模式构建有效的多轮越狱攻击，在12个LLM和10种危害类别上实现最先进性能，揭示了模型特定的脆弱性和行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式或临时探索策略，对模型底层弱点理解有限，且对话模式与模型脆弱性之间的关系尚未明确。

Method: 提出PE-CoA框架，包含五种对话模式，通过自然对话构建有效的多轮越狱攻击。

Result: 在12个LLM和10种危害类别上实现最先进性能，发现模型对特定对话模式存在脆弱性，且模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了质量估计重排序在文档级机器翻译中的应用，发现使用学习型质量估计指标SLIDE和基于大语言模型的GEMBA-DA指标能显著提升翻译质量，即使在长文档上也能获得改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排序在句子级翻译中已被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，需要探索其在文档级翻译中的表现。

Method: 使用多种学习型和基于大语言模型的质量估计指标（如SLIDE和GEMBA-DA），在文档级翻译中进行候选翻译的重排序，比较不同候选数量下的性能提升。

Result: 使用最佳学习型指标SLIDE，BLEURT-20分数在仅2个候选时提升+2.00，在32个候选时提升+5.09；使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA，相应提升为+1.63和+4.30。即使在最长文档上，32个候选的重排序仍能带来+2.34（SLIDE）和+1.40（GEMBA-DA）的改进。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排序具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下能以最小的运行时开销显著提升翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing是首个针对财务审计任务评估LLM的基准，包含三个子任务：语义一致性、关系一致性和数值一致性，揭示了当前LLM在结构化财务文档推理中的系统性局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使得财务审计难以自动化验证，而LLM在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 从真实的US-GAAP合规XBRL文件中构建FinAuditing基准，定义三个互补子任务，并提出统一的评估框架，在13个最先进的LLM上进行零样本实验。

Result: 当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度上表现不一致，当在分层多文档结构上推理时，准确率下降高达60-90%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在基于分类法的财务推理中存在系统性限制，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知和法规对齐的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过为不同token类型设置差异化温度的策略，能够有效提升LLM在强化学习环境中的推理能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: 提出语义锚点压缩(SAC)方法，通过直接选择原始上下文中的锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，避免了自编码训练与下游任务不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩方法依赖自编码任务训练压缩token，但自编码的重构优化目标与下游任务存在根本性不匹配，削弱了对实际使用更有益的特征。

Method: SAC直接选择锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，包含两个关键设计：锚点嵌入使压缩器能识别关键token，双向注意力修改使锚点token能捕获整个上下文信息。

Result: 实验表明SAC在各种压缩比下均优于现有方法，在MRQA的分布外评估中，5倍压缩时比强基线提升1 EM，压缩比越高优势越明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过直接从上下文token派生表示，消除了自编码训练需求，提供了一种更有效的上下文压缩方法。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM内部是否存在类似人类印象和刻板印象的模式，以及这些模式如何影响模型的下游行为。

Method: 使用刻板印象内容模型(SCM)的二维框架，在LLM生成的提示上拟合线性探针来预测印象，并分析这些印象与模型行为的关系。

Result: 发现LLM在提示时不一致地报告印象，但从隐藏表征中可线性解码出更一致的印象；人工印象能预测响应质量和模棱两可语言的使用；特定内容、风格和方言特征会影响LLM印象。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在可解码的人工印象模式，这些模式与模型行为相关，提示特征会影响这些印象的形成。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分评估LLM在涉及复杂标准操作程序的商业场景中的能力，需要专门基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 基于真实商业数据构建SOP-Maze基准，将SOP任务分为横向根系统(LRS)和核心根系统(HRS)两类，并进行广泛的实验分析。

Result: 几乎所有最先进的模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，识别出三种关键错误：路径盲区、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进模型在复杂SOP任务中的能力提供了新见解，相关成果已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

Motivation: 研究开源社区如何通过版本控制的治理文档描述参与和控制，为评估AI中介工作流是否集中或重新分配权力提供可复现基线。

Method: 将治理文档文本解析为参与者、规则、行动和对象，使用熵衡量均匀性、丰富度衡量多样性、Jensen Shannon散度衡量漂移。

Result: 项目随时间定义更多角色和行动，且分布更均匀，而规则组成保持稳定。

Conclusion: 治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而增长，没有发生重大的规范性转变，为评估AI工作流对权力的影响提供了基准。

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的RLVR方法依赖静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型能力的动态变化，导致训练不均衡和性能受限。

Method: 提出DARO方法，根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献权重，解决损失尺度问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B模型上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线方法，收敛更快且最终性能更优。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态难度感知的权重调整机制，有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，显著提升了模型推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

TL;DR: LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data, serving as cost-efficient safety patches that decouple safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment is crucial for trustworthy AI but challenging to implement without degrading general performance. Current methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions, incurring high costs with limited gains.

Method: LoRA-based Refusal-training approach that trains solely on safety data, leveraging LoRA's ability to decouple safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space.

Result: Demonstrates that LoRA serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches, enabling safety alignment without compromising general model capabilities.

Conclusion: LoRA effectively decouples safety enhancements from inherent model capabilities, providing both theoretical and experimental evidence for its effectiveness as a performance-preserving safety alignment method.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的方法虽然性能强，但依赖专有模型，存在部署可行性和数据隐私问题。需要开发轻量级解决方案。

Method: 包含两个组件：(1)模式检索器使用预计算模式嵌入的向量数据库进行高效模式链接；(2)SQL生成器采用两阶段微调：监督微调后接执行引导的强化学习，实现自我修正而无需昂贵多候选生成。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上达到72.10%执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到88.45%，性能与LLM方法相当或更优，但参数减少2-30倍。

Conclusion: 高质量Text-to-SQL生成可通过轻量模型实现，为隐私敏感和资源受限场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer

TL;DR: 该研究通过迭代优化评分标准来提升LLM在自动作文评分中的表现，在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上实现了显著的QWK提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能对提示词高度敏感，受提示优化领域的启发，本研究探索通过优化评分标准来提升自动作文评分的效果。

Method: 通过让模型反思自身评分理由与人工评分的差异，迭代优化评分标准，在样本作文上进行测试和调整。

Result: 在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上使用GPT-4.1等模型，QWK分别提升了0.19和0.47，即使使用简单初始标准也能达到或超过详细人工标准的效果。

Conclusion: 迭代评分标准优化对于基于LLM的自动作文评分至关重要，能够显著提升与人工评估的一致性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究为低资源印地语系语言Chakma构建了首个上下文连贯的孟加拉语转写Chakma语料库，并通过微调多语言Transformer模型，在掩码语言建模任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma作为印地语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性不足。研究旨在解决这一低资源语言的处理问题。

Method: 从Chakma文学作品中收集数据，经母语者验证构建语料库，然后对6种多语言Transformer模型进行掩码语言建模微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在Bangla-transliterated Chakma上表现优异，最高达到73.54%的token准确率和2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: Bangla-transliterated Chakma对于Chakma语言的迁移学习非常有效，研究还揭示了数据质量对模型性能的重要影响以及OCR处理形态丰富的印地文字时的局限性。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs内部表示无法可靠区分事实和幻觉，因为基于主题知识的幻觉与正确回答使用相同的内部回忆过程，导致隐藏状态几何重叠不可区分；而脱离主题知识的幻觉则有明显不同的表示模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否真的"知道它们不知道什么"，以及内部计算能否可靠区分事实性输出和幻觉输出。

Method: 通过机制分析比较两种类型的幻觉：基于主题知识的幻觉和脱离主题知识的幻觉，分析LLMs内部处理事实查询的过程。

Result: 发现当幻觉与主题知识相关时，LLMs使用与正确回答相同的内部回忆过程，隐藏状态几何重叠不可区分；而脱离主题知识的幻觉产生明显不同的聚类表示，可以被检测到。

Conclusion: LLMs在其内部状态中并不编码真实性，而只编码知识回忆的模式，表明"LLMs并不真正知道它们不知道什么"。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

TL;DR: 提出了Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct，一个乌尔都语-英语多语言模型，通过改进的自指导技术创建高质量合成数据集，在不到100美元的训练预算下显著提升了乌尔都语任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发高性能LLM面临的挑战，包括高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题，避免传统翻译方法的质量和文化细微差异问题。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术创建高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语本土思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐，基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建模型。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B等领先多语言LLM。

Conclusion: 证明通过改进的自指导方法可以高效开发高性能、低资源语言LLM，并实现文化对齐，所有数据集、模型和代码均已公开。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

TL;DR: ReFIne是一个训练框架，通过监督微调和GRPO结合，提升推理模型的可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，而不仅仅是准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长链思维推理研究过度关注准确性和token效率，忽视了可信赖性的关键方面。可用的推理系统必须具备可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReFIne训练框架，结合监督微调和GRPO，鼓励模型：生成结构化标签化轨迹、明确披露决策信息、提供自我评估置信度。在Qwen3模型(1.7B/4B/8B)上应用。

Result: ReFIne模型生成更清晰的结构化推理轨迹(可解释性+44.0%)，更忠实地暴露决策过程(忠实性+18.8%)，提供信息丰富的置信度估计(可靠性+42.4%)。

Conclusion: 推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应优化可信赖性的更广泛维度。这是一个被忽视但重要的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

TL;DR: 提出基于因果语言模型(CLM)的语义框架归纳新方法FrameEOL，通过上下文学习和深度度量学习获得更适合框架归纳的嵌入表示，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型(CLM)在多种语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务，而掩码语言模型(MLM)在该任务中已取得高性能。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：基于提示的框架嵌入获取方法，输出代表给定情境的框架名称标签；利用上下文学习(ICL)和深度度量学习(DML)获得更适合框架归纳的嵌入表示；通过聚类进行框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有框架归纳方法；对于缺乏丰富框架资源的日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 基于CLM的框架归纳方法有效，特别是在资源稀缺语言中表现优异，为语义框架归纳任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速变化的信息或领域特定查询，RAG通过集成外部检索机制来解决这一限制

Method: 通过系统性综述方法，分析RAG的总体目标、核心组件、关键挑战和局限性

Result: 识别了RAG的关键弱点，并展示了在LLMs单独表现不佳但结合RAG能显著提升效果的多个应用场景

Conclusion: 需要重新审视RAG的角色，并激发下一代RAG系统的开发

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

Motivation: 现有机器翻译基准主要依赖表面指标，无法有效评估网络小说翻译的叙事和文化保真度，需要专门针对这一体裁的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含18K专家标注中英句对的DITING评估框架，提出基于推理的多智能体评估方法AgentEval，开发包含300句对的MetricAlign元评估数据集。

Result: 评估14个模型发现，中文训练的LLM优于更大的国外模型，DeepSeek-V3在忠实度和风格一致性方面表现最佳。AgentEval在七个自动指标中与人工评估相关性最高。

Conclusion: 为LLM网络小说翻译研究建立了新范式，提供了公开资源推动未来研究发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Method: 在对话数据中增加思考式话语(TAU)，训练个性化LLM，并使用大五人格框架评估模型表现

Result: 使用TAU增强数据训练的LLM在宜人性和神经质两个维度上更接近说话者的真实人格特质，且TAU质量影响模型性能

Conclusion: 思考式话语增强能有效提升LLM对个体人格的建模能力，特别是在宜人性和神经质维度

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

Motivation: 现有的文本去标识化方法难以有效评估其身份保护能力，需要通过重新识别攻击来测试去标识化方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 研究PII跨度重新识别顺序的重要性，通过多排序预测聚合改进结果；2) 使用推理模型提升重新识别性能，特别是在攻击者拥有丰富背景知识的情况下。

Result: 多排序预测聚合和推理模型都能显著提升重新识别攻击的效果，特别是在攻击者具备广泛背景知识时推理模型表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的两种策略能够构建更强的重新识别攻击，为评估文本去标识化方法的鲁棒性提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理但翻译能力不足，而专门优化的翻译模型又缺乏推理能力，需要找到平衡两者的方法

Method: 从指令模型开始，仅使用平行数据对特定层进行选择性调优

Result: Qwen3-XPlus模型在高低资源语言翻译上都有显著提升，低资源语言如斯瓦希里语达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet，同时在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，在15个推理数据集上保持与Qwen3指令模型相当的能力

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂性并提高了更多语言的可访问性

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在执行推理任务时往往优先考虑推理过程而忽视详细的输出格式要求，而通过监督数据集微调LLMs计算成本高且参数访问受限。

Method: DICE采用解耦方法：先提示LLMs生成自然语言响应，然后使用训练好的SLMs分析和精炼这些输出以满足结构化输出规范。通过两阶段方法构建结构化思维链适应数据集，并应用双重调优策略微调SLMs以生成结构化输出。

Result: 实验表明DICE将LLM输出的平均格式准确性和内容正确性分别提高了35.4%和29.4%，在竞争基线中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DICE框架在保持LLMs广泛知识和推理能力的同时，确保输出符合用户需求，为解决LLMs输出格式问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Motivation: 传统统计方法面临数据收集成本高、已知关系重复计算、假设不现实等挑战，而现有LLM方法只能发现已知关系，无法发现新关系。

Method: IRIS框架自动收集相关文档、提取变量、发现因果关系，采用混合方法结合统计算法和LLM，并包含缺失变量提议组件来扩展因果图。

Result: 该方法实现了仅从初始变量集进行实时因果发现，无需预先存在的数据集。

Conclusion: IRIS解决了传统方法和LLM方法的局限性，能够同时发现已知和新的因果关系，并动态扩展因果图。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

Conclusion: CrisiText数据集填补了危机预警消息生成研究的空白，为开发更有效的紧急情况AI辅助系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSPO算法，通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在多个QA基准上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖提示激发模型内在能力，要么在复杂交互任务中应用RL时存在性能上限和崩溃问题，未能充分挖掘模型的代理潜力

Method: DSPO算法：动态过滤序列级策略优化，纯RL训练模型进行多轮搜索和推理交织，无需监督演示数据

Result: 7B模型在多个QA基准上比之前工作提升34.1%，在HotpotQA等复杂多跳QA上甚至超越之前14B模型近9%，保持优异训练稳定性

Conclusion: DSPO算法能有效提升LLM的主动搜索能力，在复杂真实世界任务中表现出色

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

*Yongding Tao,Tian Wang,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Self-Critique方法，专门用于检测LLM在强化学习后训练阶段的数据污染问题，解决了现有方法在该场景下的检测盲区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RL后训练在提升LLM推理能力中变得日益重要，缺乏专门针对该阶段的数据污染检测方法成为一个关键漏洞，现有方法主要关注预训练和SFT阶段。

Method: 基于RL后训练导致LLM输出熵分布坍缩到特定稀疏模式的关键观察，提出Self-Critique方法，通过探测底层策略坍缩（模型收敛到狭窄推理路径）来检测数据污染。

Result: 在多个模型和污染任务上的广泛实验表明，Self-Critique显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%，而现有方法在RL阶段污染检测上接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: Self-Critique方法使得RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测成为可能，填补了该领域的重要研究空白，并为此构建了专门的RL-MIA基准。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 提出了CFVBench基准测试，评估多模态检索增强生成模型的性能，发现现有模型在捕捉细粒度多模态细节方面存在瓶颈，并提出自适应视觉优化框架AVR来改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MRAG基准测试在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面有限，主要关注单一或有限模态任务，或粗粒度场景理解，需要更全面的评估基准。

Method: 构建CFVBench基准测试（599个视频，5360个QA对），系统评估7种检索方法和14个MLLM模型，并提出自适应视觉优化框架AVR，通过自适应增加帧采样密度和选择性调用外部工具来改善细粒度多模态理解。

Result: 当前模型（包括GPT-5和Gemini）在捕捉瞬态但关键的细粒度多模态细节方面存在困难，AVR框架能持续增强细粒度多模态理解并提升所有评估MLLM的性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度多模态理解是当前MRAG模型的关键瓶颈，提出的AVR框架能有效缓解这一问题，为未来多模态模型开发提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs评估主要依赖静态医学考试基准，高估模型性能且忽视真实临床中模糊多变的情况，与真实临床实践存在根本性错位。

Method: 提出DyReMe动态基准，生成新鲜咨询式病例，引入鉴别诊断和常见误诊因素等干扰，模拟多样化真实查询习惯，在四个临床相关维度评估模型。

Result: 实验表明动态方法产生更具挑战性和真实性的评估，揭示了最先进LLMs性能与真实临床实践之间的显著错位。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信医疗诊断需求的评估框架，DyReMe为这一目标提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，通常依赖选择题。标准基于结果的强化学习虽然可能提高准确性，但经常会降低推理质量如逻辑一致性。现有监督推理的解决方案如大规模过程奖励模型成本过高。

Method: CLARity框架集成一致性感知奖励机制与两阶段精炼-监控训练流程来增强推理一致性，并采用动态数据重构策略更好地利用有限数据。使用小型通用LLM来指导专家模型。

Result: 实验表明CLARity相比基线方法将响应一致性提高了16.5%，准确性提高了7.5%。人工评估进一步确认了连贯性和专业性的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个通用解决方案，使较小模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型，在数据稀缺领域实现更好的推理质量。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

TL;DR: DualCSE是一种句子嵌入方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，另一个表示隐式语义，以克服传统单向量方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法为每个句子只分配单个向量，难以捕捉句子中的隐式语义，存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出DualCSE方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：显式语义嵌入和隐式语义嵌入，这些嵌入在共享空间中并存，可根据特定任务需求选择合适语义。

Result: 实验结果表明DualCSE能有效编码显式和隐式含义，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DualCSE通过双嵌入方法成功克服了传统句子嵌入的局限性，能够更好地捕捉句子语义，提高下游任务效果。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练评估存在显著不稳定性，掩盖了真实学习动态，需要系统诊断和解决

Method: 提出MaP双管齐下框架：检查点合并平滑参数空间，Pass@k提供低方差统计估计

Result: 实验表明MaP产生更平滑性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名

Conclusion: MaP为LLM研究提供了更可靠和忠实的训练动态观察方法，奠定了重要的实证基础

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能中的基础任务，但由于案件事实的多样性和复杂性，直接从原始事实生成可能限制性能。

Method: 构建了包含11万多个案件的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，每个案件包含事实描述和对应的法院观点，并基于此训练专门的大语言模型。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成上达到58.5 BLEU-1，在罪名预测上达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏平均F1值。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，即使是一个小型大语言模型，在高质量领域特定数据上训练后，也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个专为扩散大语言模型设计的训练无关缓存淘汰框架，通过mask-query评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略，显著减少KV缓存内存占用，在仅保留5%token的情况下保持94%性能，实现最高31倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的双向注意力缓存机制需要大量内存，限制了在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有的缓存淘汰策略是为自回归模型设计的，忽略了扩散模型的独特特性，导致性能不佳。

Method: MaskKV包含两个关键创新：1) 基于mask-query的评分机制，利用注意力权重识别和淘汰每个注意力头中不太重要的提示token；2) 自适应缓存预算策略，减少中间层分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的注意力头上。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，将KV缓存压缩到仅256对（少于5%的token），在LongBench上保留了94%的全缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现了最高31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了扩散大语言模型在长上下文处理中的内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境下的高效推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有的思维链验证方法基于输出或激活状态，无法深入理解计算失败的原因，需要一种能揭示推理错误根本原因的白盒方法。

Method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV)方法，通过训练分类器来分析正确和错误推理步骤属性图的结构特征差异。

Result: 该方法能有效预测推理错误，发现错误特征具有高度领域特异性，并能通过针对性干预成功纠正模型的错误推理。

Conclusion: 通过审视模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的更深层次因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型参数庞大，难以在资源受限硬件上部署。现有低秩压缩方法采用统一压缩比会导致性能显著下降，且在解码阶段表现不佳。

Method: 提出细粒度低秩压缩器(FLRC)，为每层高效确定最优秩分配，并融入渐进低秩解码以维持文本生成质量。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC在摘要任务上相比最先进低秩压缩方法在ROUGE-L指标上提升达17%，建立了更稳健高效的LLM推理框架。

Conclusion: FLRC通过细粒度秩分配和渐进解码策略，有效解决了低秩压缩中的性能退化问题，为资源受限环境下的LLM部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Motivation: C2C平台上的个人卖家在二手产品定价方面面临挑战，现有静态回归模型泛化性能差且无法捕捉市场动态变化。

Method: LLP框架包含：1）检索相似产品；2）利用LLM理解自由文本中的关键定价信息；3）通过监督微调和组相对策略优化的两阶段训练；4）基于置信度的过滤机制。

Result: 在闲鱼平台部署后，在30%产品覆盖率下，静态采纳率从40%提升至72%，在90%召回率下仍保持47%的采纳率。

Conclusion: LLP框架显著优于现有方法，能够很好泛化到未见过的品类，成功解决了二手产品动态定价问题。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

TL;DR: ReTraceQA是一个新的基准测试，通过过程级评估揭示SLMs在常识推理任务中经常给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对小型语言模型的评估主要关注最终答案的准确性，而忽略了推理过程的有效性，这可能导致对模型能力的过高估计。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准，使用专家标注的数据集，并采用大型语言模型作为自动评判器进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现14-24%的情况下SLMs给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷；使用LLMs进行推理感知评估时，SLMs在所有模型和数据集上的性能显著下降，得分最多降低25%。

Conclusion: 仅关注最终答案的评估方法会高估SLMs的能力，过程级评估对于准确评估模型推理能力至关重要。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

Conclusion: ThinkLogit方法有效，即使引导器和目标模型来自不同家族，且与后训练方法正交，为无需昂贵后训练解锁大模型长推理能力提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

*Fang Yuan,Junjie Zeng,Yue Hu,Zhengqiu Zhu,Quanjun Yin,Yuxiang Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NL2GenSym框架，将大型语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，解决了SOAR手动编码规则的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编码规则，这限制了其实际应用。大型语言模型具有生成规则的潜力，但现有研究缺乏实验验证。

Method: 采用执行导向的生成器-批评器机制：LLM生成器基于检索增强生成访问自演进领域知识库提出规则，SOAR环境执行验证规则正确性，LLM批评器基于执行反馈迭代优化规则。

Result: 在水壶问题数据集上，框架实现了超过86%的规则生成成功率，生成的新启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，是基线方法的1/1000。小参数模型也能获得优于大模型的性能。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym框架成功地将LLM与SOAR结合，实现了从自然语言自动生成符号规则，显著提升了规则生成效率和智能体性能。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了医学领域大语言模型的微调机制，发现微调仅改变表示子空间的一小部分，提出tuning vectors框架来捕捉参数变化方向，这些向量能提升指令遵循和生成质量，并改善跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解领域特定微调如何重塑大语言模型的参数空间机制，目前对领域专业化LLM的研究不足，特别是医学领域。

Method: 提出tuning vectors框架（受task vectors启发），系统分析医学LLM微调，研究参数变化方向和子空间修改。

Result: 微调仅修改表示子空间的子集，保持预训练表示；tuning vectors能增强指令遵循和生成质量；组合不同领域向量可改善泛化；向量主要在MLP层写入新方向信息，在注意力头中放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM适应提供了新见解，并为分析大语言模型专业化提供了通用可解释框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

TL;DR: TEPO是一种新颖的token级框架，通过马尔可夫似然将组级奖励与token关联，解决了GRPO等熵正则化方法在思维链稀疏token奖励中的挑战，显著提升了数学推理性能和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO和相关熵正则化方法在思维链的稀疏token奖励上面临挑战，当前方法依赖无差别的token级熵调整，常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃。

Method: 提出TEPO框架，通过马尔可夫似然将组级奖励与token关联，实现token级聚合。

Result: 实验表明TEPO在关键指标（包括@k和准确率）上持续优于现有基线，在数学推理任务上达到新的最先进水平，并显著提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TEPO通过token级框架有效解决了GRPO等方法的局限性，为数学推理任务提供了更稳定和高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中的歧义会导致AI生成的代码看似正确但不符合用户意图，特别是在数据可视化任务中，这影响了人机沟通的效果。

Method: 开发了歧义类型分类法，提出了量化指标，使用DS-1000数据集中的Matplotlib问题，评估了三种语用模型（Gricean合作原则、话语表征理论、问题讨论框架）的多轮对话策略。

Result: 提出的歧义指标比不确定性基线更符合人类标注，多轮语用对话能有效减少歧义并提高代码准确性。

Conclusion: 多轮对话交换在代码生成中具有重要价值，能够通过减少歧义来更好地匹配用户目标。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

TL;DR: 提出多尺度图思维链提示框架MSGCOT，通过整合多尺度结构信息解决现有图提示方法局限于单一粒度的问题，显著提升少样本场景下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图提示调优方法仅限于单一粒度（节点级或子图级），忽略了图数据固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计轻量级低秩粗化网络捕获多尺度结构特征作为分层基向量，模拟人类从粗到细的认知过程，在每一步推理中动态整合多尺度信息，形成渐进式粗到细的提示链。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 将多尺度信息整合到图提示中能够有效提升模型性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，证明了多尺度图提示框架的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

TL;DR: LLM SELECTOR是首个用于大语言模型主动选择的框架，通过自适应选择少量信息量大的查询进行标注，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法需要完全标注的数据集，成本高昂。需要一种能高效识别最佳LLM的框架，减少标注需求。

Method: 使用自适应查询选择策略，选择对模型选择最信息丰富的少量查询进行标注，并利用基于评判者的标注模型进一步降低成本。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验表明，LLM SELECTOR在选择最佳和接近最佳模型时，标注成本降低了高达59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR提供了一种高效且成本效益高的LLM选择方法，显著减少了模型评估所需的标注工作量。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何内部表示实体，因为实体是文本知识的基本构建块，但现有研究主要关注显式关系，对实体表示本身了解甚少。

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，利用任务向量从LLMs隐藏状态的各种实体表示中一致生成多标记提及，提出扩展logit-lens的Entity Lens来预测多标记提及。

Result: LLMs开发了实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多标记实体，包括训练中未见过的实体。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究LLMs内部实体表示提供了新视角，揭示了模型对实体编码和操作的机制。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Motivation: 研究如何有效管理口语对话中的上下文信息，以提升Speech-LLMs在口语对话状态跟踪任务中的性能。

Method: 系统评估了三种策略：传统多模态上下文（文本历史+当前轮次语音）、完整口语历史和压缩口语历史，在SpokenWOZ语料库上进行实验。

Result: 完整口语历史输入在相似规模模型中表现最佳，显著超越先前方法；注意力池化压缩方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时减少了上下文大小。

Conclusion: 改进源于更有效的上下文利用，完整口语历史是最优策略，而压缩方法提供了良好的准确性与效率平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed
analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context
utilization.

Motivation: 针对非英语语言（特别是韩语）资源匮乏的问题，探索使用合成数据构建完全开放的双语大语言模型，为低资源语言环境提供可复现的开发框架。

Method: 从零开始训练10.8B参数的韩英双语模型，其中68.74%的韩语数据为合成数据，通过精心策划的语言覆盖和多样化的指令风格来确保数据质量。

Result: 模型在推理、知识和指令跟随等广泛基准测试中表现与当代多语言基线模型相当，证明了合成数据不会导致模型崩溃或性能下降。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以可靠地支持长期预训练，双语指令调优能够实现接近母语的韩语推理和语篇连贯性，为未来多语言LLM研究设立了可复现的先例。

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Motivation: 现实交通事故数据库中的自由文本叙述对交通安全分析很重要，但现有工具难以批量处理非结构化文本。大型语言模型在推理密集型任务上表现不佳，且存在隐私和领域知识不足的问题。

Method: 使用紧凑型开源预训练语言模型（BERT等），通过低秩适应（LoRA）和微调技术注入特定领域知识，从交通事故叙述中提取碰撞方式和事故类型信息。

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Motivation: 尽管开源LLM激增，但训练数据的访问仍然有限，且规模庞大难以分析。需要开发工具来索引和分析这些数据，以支持LLM安全性和可解释性研究。

Method: 利用Elasticsearch并行索引和Alps基础设施（先进的arm64超级集群），构建全文索引流水线，索引Apertus LLM训练数据中的8.6T tokens。

Result: 成功将Elasticsearch移植到arm64基础设施，证明现代LLM训练数据集规模的全文索引是可行的，并创建了可用于LLM安全的索引工具。

Conclusion: 大规模数据索引在arm64基础设施上是可行的，为更环保的计算转型提供了支持，同时为LLM安全性和数据分析提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Motivation: 神经模型的泛化能力对于逻辑推理等应用至关重要，但现有研究往往将组合性和递归性这两个关键方面混为一谈，需要明确区分并评估LLMs在这两方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用三段论片段作为自然语言推理的基准，评估预训练大语言模型的逻辑泛化能力，并提出了整合符号推理与神经计算的混合架构。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在递归性方面表现出合理熟练度，但在组合性方面存在显著困难；提出的混合架构在保持高效率的同时实现了稳健推理。

Conclusion: 混合模型有潜力有效解决神经推理系统中的关键泛化障碍，神经组件加速处理，符号推理确保完整性，即使使用相对较小的神经组件也能保持高效率。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 这是首个多模态策略内化工作，提供了数据集、训练方法和全面评估，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

TL;DR: 本文分析了无标签情况下评估NLP模型跨域性能排名的可靠性，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比漂移基准或零样本方法产生更一致和更强的排名相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化时，无标签估计模型性能是一个重要目标。现有方法基于数据集相似性或预测正确性，但它们在跨域时产生可靠性能排名的条件尚不清楚。

Method: 使用四类基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器，在GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集的15个领域上进行两步评估。比较了基于大语言模型的错误预测器与漂移基准和零样本基线方法。

Result: 实验表明，基于大语言模型的错误预测器比漂移基准或零样本基线产生更强和更一致的排名相关性。分析发现两个关键因素：跨域性能差异越大时排名越可靠，错误模型预测与基础模型真实失败模式对齐时排名越可靠。

Conclusion: 这些结果阐明了性能估计方法何时可以被信任，并为它们在跨域模型评估中的使用提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种口音不变的ASR框架，通过集成口音分类和频谱图掩蔽数据增强，提升多语言语音识别对口音变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练Transformer模型在语音识别中表现优异，但对口音和方言变化敏感，导致在英语和波斯语等语言多样性语言中词错误率升高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，识别关键口音特征区域并进行掩蔽，使用掩蔽后的频谱图进行数据增强，增强ASR模型对口音变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在英语和波斯语实验中，使用Whisper模型验证了该方法能显著降低词错误率，特别是在新收集的波斯语多区域口音数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多语言ASR系统对口音和方言多样性的适应能力，为低资源语言多样性语言的语音研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

TL;DR: 提出GRSP方法，通过步骤级监督来平衡推理模型的效率与准确性，解决过度思考问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于验证器奖励的强化学习方法在减少推理长度时会损害模型性能，需要更细粒度的监督来平衡效率与准确性

Method: 提出分组相对片段惩罚(GRSP)，基于推理片段设计长度感知的权重机制，在片段簇间进行步骤级正则化

Result: GRSP在保持准确性的同时显著提升token效率，尤其在难题上优势明显，并能稳定强化学习训练，在不同模型规模上有效扩展

Conclusion: 监督粒度对平衡推理模型的效率与准确性至关重要，GRSP通过步骤级方法有效解决了过度思考问题

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，评估了18个开源LLM在5个下游任务中的抗错能力，发现拼写错误会降低模型性能，特别是在生成和推理任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中用户输入常包含拼写错误，但现有基准测试多假设输入干净，LLM在多语言环境下的抗错能力研究不足。

Method: 开发了基于语言特定键盘布局和打字行为的MulTypo算法生成类人拼写错误，在语言推理、多选问答、数学推理和机器翻译等5个任务上评估18个开源LLM。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低性能，生成任务和推理任务受影响更大；指令调优提高干净输入性能但可能增加噪声下的脆弱性；高资源语言比低资源语言更鲁棒；英译外比外译英更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 需要噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，使用真实对数似然的上界和下界来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)虽然能并行解码多个token，但由于其难以处理的对数似然，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好或任务奖励的对齐。现有方法使用ELBO等单边近似会引入显著策略梯度偏差。

Method: 提出Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差，相比基于ELBO或单步估计的基线方法更准确。

Result: SPG在多个任务上显著优于基线方法：GSM8K准确率提升3.6%，MATH500提升2.6%，Countdown提升18.4%，Sudoku提升27.0%。

Conclusion: SPG方法有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在数学推理和逻辑推理任务上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dyna-Mind是一个两阶段训练框架，通过教导AI代理进行心理模拟来提升其在复杂交互环境中的推理和决策能力。第一阶段ReSim训练代理从环境交互中生成结构化推理轨迹，第二阶段Dyna-GRPO使用强化学习进一步强化模拟和决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在数学和编程方面表现出色，但在长视野交互任务（如网页导航和设备使用）中表现不佳。受人类认知启发，认为AI需要'替代性试错'能力，即在进行行动前心理模拟替代未来，以增强在复杂环境中的理解和表现。

Method: 提出Dyna-Mind两阶段框架：1）ReSim：训练代理从真实环境交互构建的扩展搜索树生成结构化推理轨迹，使推理基于真实世界动态；2）Dyna-GRPO：在线强化学习方法，使用结果奖励和中间状态作为反馈来加强模拟和决策能力。

Result: 在Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld三个基准测试上的实验表明：1）ReSim有效将模拟能力注入AI代理；2）Dyna-GRPO利用结果和交互级信号学习更好的长视野、规划密集型任务策略。

Conclusion: 模拟在使AI代理在日益挑战的环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动中发挥着核心作用。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

TL;DR: 本文识别了扩散大语言模型中的并行-顺序矛盾(PSC)，即并行解码与因果推理顺序的冲突。研究发现DLLMs仅在简单任务中展现真正并行性，复杂任务中会退化为自回归行为。作者提出了三个扩展维度和实际缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然提供了高吞吐量和有效顺序推理，但其并行解码与因果推理顺序存在根本冲突，限制了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 通过行为分析研究DLLMs在不同难度任务中的表现，识别PSC现象。引入三个扩展维度：并行、扩散和顺序扩展。提出并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解策略。

Result: DLLMs仅在可直接判定的输出上展现真正并行性。任务难度增加时，模型退化为自回归行为。自回归提示使解码步骤加倍但不改善质量。PSC限制了自我反思、推理深度和探索广度。

Conclusion: 并行扩展能带来持续改进，但扩散和顺序扩展受PSC限制。提出的缓解策略可减少PSC引起的无效性和低效率。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统要么将小时级视频压缩为粗粒度嵌入，要么细粒度匹配成本过高，需要解决多语言医学视频档案中复杂多跳问题的检索挑战。

Method: 使用多阶段框架：将视频字幕分为语义连贯的块，用知识图谱事实增强，构建分层树结构，通过语言无关的多语言编码器生成节点嵌入，采用粗到细的树搜索策略，最后用轻量级LLM重排。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上达到最先进性能，消融研究证实知识图谱增强、分层索引和针对性LLM重排的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型依赖思维链推理提升任务性能，但在多语言环境中，导致最终答案的中间推理步骤本身仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过测量语言遵从性、答案准确性和一致性，评估跨语言推理轨迹一致性，并采用截断和错误注入的扰动技术来探测推理轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 研究发现模型在不同提示语言下的推理轨迹质量和有效性差异显著，模型对推理轨迹的依赖程度因语言而异。

Conclusion: 多语言思维链推理存在明显的语言偏好和性能差异，需要进一步研究以确保多语言推理的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Method: 创建包含8,880个刺激项的WUGNECTIVES数据集，评估17个不同规模和训练方案的语言模型在新实体推理任务上的表现。

Result: 调整语言模型以显示推理行为能显著改善大多数连接词的表现，但所有模型在表达让步意义的连接词上都存在系统性困难。

Conclusion: 研究为更细致地探索语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用铺平了道路。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

Conclusion: MPS有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距，实现了类似人类边思考边说话的能力

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large

introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

*Giacomo Dimarco,Federica Ferrarese,Lorenzo Pareschi*

TL;DR: 提出一种结合流行病学模型和深度学习的数据增强方法，通过生成合成数据提升神经网络预测精度，在COVID-19疫情预测中验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高神经网络训练效果和预测准确性，特别是在数据有限的情况下，通过数据增强策略来改善模型性能。

Method: 使用合适的流行病学模型生成合成数据，结合不确定性分析，将模型校准与深度学习技术集成，为训练生成额外的合成数据。

Result: 在增强数据集上训练的神经网络预测性能显著提升，NAR模型在短期预测中表现优异，PINNs在长期趋势分析中更有效。

Conclusion: 数据增强策略能有效提升神经网络预测性能，NAR模型适合短期精确预测，PINNs适合长期定性分析，该方法在COVID-19疫情预测中验证成功。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a data augmentation strategy aimed at improving the
training phase of neural networks and, consequently, the accuracy of their
predictions. Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a
suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty.
The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further
integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data
for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented
datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in
particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR
approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing
accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and
avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints
into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative
predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system,
making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical
simulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region
(Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We propose a low-rank method for solving the Helmholtz equation. Our approach
is based on the WaveHoltz method, which computes Helmholtz solutions by
applying a time-domain filter to the solution of a related wave equation. The
wave equation is discretized by high-order multiblock summation-by-parts finite
differences. In two dimensions we use the singular value decomposition and in
three dimensions we use tensor trains to compress the numerical solution. To
control rank growth we use step-truncation during time stepping and a low-rank
Anderson acceleration for the WaveHoltz fixed point iteration. We have carried
out extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the convergence and efficacy
of the iterative scheme for free- and half-space problems in two and three
dimensions with constant and piecewise constant wave speeds.

approximate solutions to the Burgers' equation (BE). Integration in time by a
quadratic B-spline collocation method is shown. To the best of our knowledge,
B-splines have not previously been used to integrate partial differential
equations in both time and space. First, the BE is integrated using quadratic
B-spline functions in time, and then the time-integrated BE is further solved
in space via the cubic B-spline collocation method. The resulting recursive
algebraic equation is used to obtain both shock wave and front propagation
solutions of the BE, demonstrating the effectiveness of the space--time
B-spline collocation method.

Abstract: We propose a multiscale method for mixed-dimensional elliptic problems with
highly heterogeneous coefficients arising, for example, in the modeling of
fractured porous media. The method is based on the Localized Orthogonal
Decomposition (LOD) framework and constructs locally supported, problem-adapted
basis functions on a coarse mesh that does not need to resolve the coefficient
oscillations. These basis functions are obtained in parallel by solving
localized fine-scale problems. Our a priori error analysis shows that the
method achieves optimal convergence with respect to the coarse mesh size,
independent of the coefficient regularity, with an exponentially decaying
localization error. Numerical experiments validate these theoretical findings
and demonstrate the computational viability of the method.

Abstract: This work provides reliable a posteriori error estimates for Runge-Kutta
discontinuous Galerkin approximations of nonlinear convection-diffusion
systems. The classes of systems we study are quite general with a focus on
convection-dominated and degenerate parabolic problems. Our a posteriori error
bounds are valid for a family of discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations
and various temporal discretizations that include explicit and
implicit-explicit time-stepping schemes, popular tools for practical
simulations of this class of problem. We prove that our estimators provide
reliable upper bounds for the error of the numerical method and present
numerical evidence showing that they achieve the same order of convergence as
the error. Since one of our main interests is the convection dominant case, we
also track the dependence of the estimator on the viscosity coefficient.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不超出系数有界性假设的情况下实现高阶收敛，成功解决了时间依赖问题中高阶LOD方法的收敛率降低问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a higher-order multiscale method for
time-dependent problems with highly oscillatory coefficients. Building on the
localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) framework, we construct enriched
correction operators to enrich the multiscale spaces, ensuring higher-order
convergence without requiring assumptions on the coefficient beyond
boundedness. This approach addresses the challenge of a reduction of

problems. Addressing a parabolic equation as a model problem, we prove the
exponential decay of these enriched corrections and establish rigorous a priori
error estimates. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.

Abstract: This paper presents multi-level hybrid transport (MLHT) methods for solving
the neutral particle Boltzmann transport equation. The proposed MLHT methods
are formulated on a sequence of spatial grids using a multi-level Monte Carlo
(MLMC) approach. The general MLMC algorithm is defined by the recursive
estimation of the expected value of a solution functional's correction with
respect to a neighboring grid. MLMC theory optimizes the total computational
cost for estimating a functional to within a target accuracy. The proposed MLHT
algorithms are based on the quasidiffusion (Variable Eddington Factor) and
second-moment methods. For these methods, the low-order equations for the
angular moments of the high-order transport solution are discretized in space.
Monte Carlo techniques compute the closures for the low-order equations; then,
the equations are solved, yielding a single realization of the global flux
solution. The ensemble average of the realizations yields the level solution.
The results for 1-D slab transport problems demonstrates weak convergence of
the functionals considered. We observe that the variance of the correction
factors decreases faster than the increase in computational costs of generating
an MLMC sample. In the problems considered, the variance and costs of the MLMC
solution are driven by the coarse grid calculations.

TL;DR: 提出EDS框架，通过基于能量的模型在推理时动态引导LLM隐藏状态，解决安全对齐中过度拒绝良性提示的问题，实现降低误拒率同时保持安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐技术往往只关注提升对有害提示的安全性，导致模型变得过度谨慎，拒绝响应良性提示。需要同时增强安全性并减少误拒。

Method: 训练轻量级外部能量模型，为不良状态分配高能量，为理想状态分配低能量。在推理时使用能量梯度动态引导LLM隐藏状态到低能量区域，实时纠正模型响应而不修改权重。

Result: 在多种模型上的广泛实验显示，该方法显著降低误拒率，例如在ORB-H基准上合规率从57.3%提升至82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能。

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，可构建同时具备低误拒率和高安全性的LLM，将行为控制与模型核心知识解耦，提供灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

TL;DR: WILSON是一个后处理诊断套件，用于检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的答案变化问题，通过计算内部表示的曲率图和激活级交换器来识别重排序风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实践中的重要编辑下会改变答案：RAG输出在段落重排序时翻转，微调侵蚀预训练学到的不变性，辩论或思维链提示采取路径依赖的路线。这些违反预期不变性的故障会破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了无逆曲率图（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）和激活级交换器来标记重排序风险。信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，并导出为阈值和CSV工件供编排器使用。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，以及在部署中控制融合或重排序。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使得可靠性和吞吐量可以同时改进，而无需改变模型架构或训练。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、可能的致病基因数量庞大。这些问题导致诊断周期长、治疗不当和关键延误，在资源有限地区尤为严重。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别最可能的致病基因，并检索相关患者子图用于临床调查。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在因果基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂遗传分析，为缺乏先进基因组基础设施的欠发达地区提供了特别价值，实现了诊断工具的民主化。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Conclusion: 点级方法能有效解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: LeFCert填补了LeFMs小样本分类器可证明鲁棒性的关键空白，为实际应用提供了高效可靠的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 现有可视化质量指标对缩放敏感，提出的尺度不变方法能更准确地评估降维投影的质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Motivation: 现有研究显示线性模型能达到与复杂架构相竞争的预测性能，但增强线性模型的方法仍待探索。作者假设不同时间序列实例可能遵循异质线性映射，因此提出动态路由机制。

Method: 提出CATS-Linear模型，采用分类辅助通道独立机制动态路由实例到专用预测器，重新设计趋势-季节性分解架构，包括解耦-线性映射-重耦合框架和复域线性投影。

Result: 大量实验验证CATS-Linear在固定超参数下达到与调参基线相竞争的SOTA精度，同时在固定超参数对比中也提供SOTA精度。

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过动态实例路由和重新设计的分解架构，证明了线性模型在时间序列预测中的强大潜力，无需复杂调参即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因组选择方法在处理复杂性状和大数据集时预测精度不足，需要更有效的模型来捕捉复杂的基因型-表型关系。

Method: 使用8维one-hot编码处理SNP数据，按染色体排序，采用PMF算法进行特征选择，结合CNN和自注意力机制构建DPCformer模型。

Result: 在5种作物的13个性状上测试，玉米性状预测精度提升达2.92%，棉花纤维性状提升8.37%，番茄小样本场景PCC提升57.35%，鹰嘴豆产量相关性提升16.62%。

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，分别处理低频和高频特征来优化推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步特征相似或连续，但这在扩散模型中并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量相似度高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似度低。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：直接重用低频特征（基于相似性），使用二阶Hermite插值器预测高频特征（基于连续性）。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)，减少99%内存占用。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存通过分别处理不同频率分量的特性，有效降低了扩散变换器的推理成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于基函数预训练的可重用初始化框架，通过预训练多项式基神经网络，然后用于初始化更复杂目标函数的网络，提高训练效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三个挑战：(i)每个目标函数需要从头训练新模型；(ii)性能对架构和超参数选择高度敏感；(iii)模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先训练基神经网络来逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后使用学习到的参数来初始化更复杂目标函数的网络。引入域映射机制将输入转换到参考域，保持与预训练模型的结构对应。

Result: 在一维和二维设置中的大量数值实验显示，在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LENS方法，通过置信度加权惩罚机制有效利用RLVR中的负样本组，提升训练效率和模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在RLVR中浪费大量计算资源，因为负样本组（无正确响应的组）产生零优势值而无梯度更新

Method: 从奖励建模的最大似然目标出发，推导出等价于修改价值函数的策略梯度，对错误响应添加置信度加权惩罚

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，LENS方法在Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-3B上持续优于GRPO基线，在困难项目上提升显著

Conclusion: LENS提供了一种原则性和实用的方法来"拯救"负样本组，提高了RLVR的效率和性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环计算成本高，需要解决代数环的数值求解问题，且存在多解模糊性问题。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，解决了多解一致性问题。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统上，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 残差驱动的机器学习方法能有效替代代数环，显著提升仿真效率，同时保证计算精度。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳问题的理论分析和实际应用。本文旨在探索ICL在时变信道均衡中的潜力，为开发具有更强适应性的下一代无线基础模型提供关键见解。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效注意力机制，利用自适应信号处理算法指导设计。提出了基于最小均方(LMS)算法、最小均方根(LRMS)公式和多步梯度更新的注意力变体，以增强非平稳任务中的适应性。

Result: 实验结果表明，ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现出强大潜力，受经典自适应算法启发的注意力机制显著提升了动态环境下的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用价值，基于自适应算法启发的注意力机制设计能够有效增强系统在动态环境中的适应能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Motivation: 通过将每个数据实例视为独立类别，鼓励模型学习对数据变换具有不变性的表示，从而在无需人工标注的情况下获得有意义的特征表示。

Method: 对每个数据实例应用随机变换生成两个不同的视图，然后训练模型将这些不同视图的表示拉近，同时与其他实例的表示推远。

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance

TL;DR: 提出了Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP)方法，通过保护属性干预的对称化来生成反事实公平的预测集，同时保持边际覆盖特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实公平研究主要关注点预测器，而预测集在不确定性下的公平决策中至关重要。另一方面，保形预测能提供有效的预测集，但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过保护属性干预的对称化来对称化符合性分数，开发了CF-CP方法，在保持边际覆盖的同时实现反事实公平的预测集。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CF-CP实现了所需的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加达到了目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP为反事实公平的不确定性量化提供了一种简单、无需训练的途径。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型推理时控制技术虽然有效，但往往基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论基础。本文旨在为这些向量和矩阵干预技术提供理论解释。

Method: 基于Dherin等人的发现，将提示的影响数学映射到隐式权重更新，并将该理论推广到深度多块Transformer。推导出将提示信息压缩为与token无关的思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 提出了理论解释现有向量和矩阵模型编辑技术的方法，并提供了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的计算基础方法。

Conclusion: 为LLM推理时控制技术提供了坚实的理论基础，解释了现有经验方法的原理，并提出了更系统化的权重更新方法。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

Motivation: 大型黑盒模型虽然能处理复杂数据，但缺乏可解释性，在高风险应用中不可靠。需要开发能够解释预测过程的方法。

Method: 使用SHAP分析量化特征对预测的贡献，然后对SHAP值进行聚类，将具有相似预测原因的数据样本分组。

Result: 成功识别了不同样本达到相同预测结果的各种路径，并在阿尔茨海默病案例研究中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类方法能够揭示黑盒模型的预测机制，为高风险领域提供可信的解释性分析。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖AutoML系统生成的复杂集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要解决准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1) 使用LightGBM作为代理模型模仿AutoGluon的预测，实现稳定的SHAP特征归因；2) 集成频谱可预测性分析来量化每个序列的固有可预测性。

Result: 在M5数据集上的实证评估显示，更高的频谱可预测性不仅与改进的预测精度强相关，还与代理模型和原始模型之间的更高保真度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供了可解释的实例级解释，同时为用户提供了可预测性指标，作为预测及其解释的可靠性指示器。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文学习在分子设计中效果有限，且每个属性的标记数据稀缺，需要一种能够利用少量示例指导分子生成的方法。

Method: 使用演示条件扩散模型，通过少量分子-得分示例定义任务上下文；开发新的分子分词器Node Pair Encoding，在基元级别表示分子，节点数减少5.5倍；在包含数百万上下文任务的数据集上预训练7亿参数模型。

Conclusion: DemoDiff可作为分子设计的基础模型，在上下文分子设计中表现出色。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化客户端内和客户端间的细粒度跨样本记忆化风险，弥补了现有方法只能检测单样本记忆化的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习记忆化检测技术只能一次检测一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的风险，而集中式学习的细粒度记忆化评估方法无法直接应用于联邦学习场景。

Method: 开发了一个框架来量化联邦学习中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化，使用跨所有客户端的细粒度跨样本记忆化测量方法，并研究了解码策略、前缀长度和FL算法等关键影响因素。

Result: 发现联邦学习模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据比客户端间数据更容易被记忆，记忆化程度受训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效检测联邦学习中的细粒度记忆化风险，揭示了跨客户端记忆化的存在及其影响因素，为联邦学习隐私保护提供了重要洞察。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LOTION框架，通过随机噪声平滑来优化量化神经网络，解决了量化目标梯度不连续的问题，在语言模型上表现优于标准QAT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，除了量化阈值处梯度未定义外，其他地方梯度为零。现有方法使用STE等技术放松梯度计算，但无法保证收敛。

Method: 受Nesterov平滑启发，引入LOTION框架，用无偏随机舍入噪声下的期望来近似量化损失表面，将原始量化损失替换为连续损失表面。

Result: 在该框架下，标准优化器保证收敛到损失表面的局部最小值。使用随机舍入噪声时，原始量化损失的全局最小值得以保留。在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上实证表现优于标准QAT。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有原则的平滑框架，有效解决了量化优化中的梯度不连续问题，并保证了收敛性和全局最优性。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial Deconfounder方法，利用空间干扰来重构未观测的混杂因子，从而同时解决空间混杂和干扰问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织的挑战：未观测的空间混杂因子和邻近处理的干扰效应，现有方法通常只解决其中一个而忽略另一个

Method: 两阶段方法：使用带有空间先验的条件变分自编码器从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder持续改进效应估计，能够非参数识别直接和溢出效应

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进结构化数据中的稳健因果推断

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Motivation: 传统CT协议优化依赖参数组合的穷举测试，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具模拟人体肝脏病变模型，结合PPO强化学习算法优化管电压、管电流、重建核、层厚和像素大小等参数

Conclusion: 该框架展示了虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合在CT协议管理中的潜力，具有灵活性和计算效率

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Motivation: 解决RL策略在新机器人、任务或物理参数不同环境中的泛化能力不足问题，提升实际应用价值

Method: 基于白金汉π定理，在无量纲空间中缩放预训练策略的观测值和动作，实现零样本迁移

Result: 在三个复杂度递增环境中验证：模拟摆、物理摆（sim-to-real验证）和高维HalfCheetah。在动态相似情境下性能无损失，在非相似情境下显著优于朴素迁移方法

Conclusion: 维度分析为增强RL策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的结构感知文本嵌入方法，通过在LLM内部编码过程中直接整合结构关系（如超链接、引用），而不是依赖传统的后处理聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了现实数据集中丰富的结构信息（如超链接、引用），这些结构信息在许多应用中提供关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种主要的内部处理方法：顺序连接和并行缓存，并引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线方法。顺序连接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 这是对内部结构感知编码的首次全面分析，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

Motivation: 传统RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中探索困难，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法过于僵化，需要更灵活的集成方式。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，RL智能体可以学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，保持软约束的灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中，LLM指导的效益随任务难度增加而提升，最复杂环境中最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM规划能力加速RL训练，无需修改现有RL算法，在挑战性环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Conclusion: 本文为欺骗性多臂老虎机问题提供了理论框架和实用算法，证明了检测约束下的最优误差指数特性，并展示了自适应算法在平衡欺骗性和私有目标识别方面的有效性。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够高效学习物理一致的时空解算子，在训练后可以快速预测具有变化输入的参数化时变PDE，验证了其在挑战性基准问题上的准确算子学习能力。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap

Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These

practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability

reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于原始Titans模型缺乏公开代码和描述模糊，阻碍了可复现性，因此需要重新实现并进行全面评估。

Method: 通过轻量级复现Titans模型，在掩码语言建模、时间序列预测和推荐任务上进行综合评估。

Result: Titans模型并不总是优于现有基线方法（受分块影响），但其神经记忆组件相比仅使用注意力的模型能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 确认了Titans模型的创新潜力，同时指出了其实际局限性，为未来研究提出了问题。

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性方法主要关注医学图像诊断任务，忽视了预后场景中的时间到事件预测公平性问题，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 开发FairTTE框架，整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，利用因果分析技术识别和量化医学影像数据集中的不同偏见来源。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同影像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，公平性在分布偏移下更难维持。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，以及更稳健、公平的预后模型来解决现有方案的局限性。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)和负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明了在共享随机性的条件下，两者的表示相似性矩阵保持接近，而参数空间耦合则不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但这种损失层面的相似性是否意味着表示层面也保持一致仍然是一个开放问题。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析其表示相似性矩阵的接近程度，并证明参数空间耦合的不稳定性。

Result: CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，对齐性随类别数增加、温度升高而改善，但参数空间的差异会随时间指数增长。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督和监督学习之间的原则性桥梁，表示层面的对齐性比参数层面的对齐性更稳定。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码(ATM)方法解决稀疏自编码器中的特征吸收问题，通过动态跟踪激活特征的重要性分数并进行概率掩码，在Gemma-2-2b模型上显著降低了吸收分数并保持良好重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为，需要更稳定的特征学习方法。

Method: 自适应时间掩码(ATM)：动态调整特征选择，跟踪激活幅度、频率和重建贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs方法显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持了优秀的重建质量。

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的稀疏分解方法来识别视觉系统中各通路的表征成分，并开发了SCA方法来测量大脑与机器表征对齐度，发现标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路对齐度更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么单一任务训练的深度神经网络能很好地建模整个视觉系统，尽管人类视觉皮层中腹侧、背侧和外侧通路具有不同的功能过程。

Method: 使用稀疏分解方法识别各视觉通路的主导表征成分，并提出了稀疏成分对齐(SCA)方法来测量大脑与机器表征的对齐程度。

Result: 发现三个视觉通路的成分响应特征存在明显差异：腹侧通路对脸、地点、身体、文字和食物敏感；外侧通路对社会互动、隐含运动和手部动作敏感；背侧通路则包含一些较难解释的成分。SCA显示标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度高于背侧和外侧通路。

Conclusion: SCA方法能比传统群体水平几何方法更精细地揭示表征对齐的差异，提供了一种对系统潜在神经调谐轴敏感的表征对齐测量方法。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Motivation: 解决多模态数据子空间聚类问题，利用深度学习框架融合不同模态信息，提升聚类性能。

Method: 使用三阶段框架：多模态编码器融合数据到潜在空间，自表达层获取亲和度矩阵，解码器重构输入数据。研究早期、晚期和中间融合策略，并提出空间融合和亲和度融合两种方法。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提方法显著优于当前最先进的多模态子空间聚类方法。

Conclusion: 提出的CNN框架能有效处理多模态子空间聚类问题，不同融合策略均能提升性能，为多模态数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Method: 引入Bernoulli参数互信息(BPMI)算法，使用链接函数的一阶泰勒展开来规避概率空间中互信息计算的不易处理性

Result: 在两个合成测试案例和一个复杂的真实世界应用（激光点火火箭燃烧器模拟）中，BPMI在所有实验中都表现出优越性能

Conclusion: BPMI在固定计算预算下实现了更高的预测精度，为多保真度高斯过程分类器提供了一种有效的批量主动学习方法

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Dig-DEC，一种无需乐观主义、纯粹通过信息增益驱动的模型自由决策估计系数，用于解决结构化观测决策问题。该方法在对抗环境中表现优异，并在混合MDP中实现了首个模型自由的遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观决策估计系数的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗环境。为了填补这一空白，需要开发一种能够同时处理随机和对抗环境的模型自由方法。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC方法，通过信息增益而非乐观主义来驱动探索，移除了对显式奖励估计器的依赖。该方法应用于具有随机转移和对抗奖励的混合MDPs。

Result: Dig-DEC始终不大于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下可以更小。在混合MDPs中获得了首个模型自由的遗憾边界，并改进了在线函数估计过程，将遗憾边界从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}（在线策略）和从T^{5/6}提升到T^{7/9}（离线策略）。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC是第一个能够在Bellman完全MDPs中达到与乐观主义方法相同性能的DEC基方法，解决了Liu等人（2025）留下的主要开放问题。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在探索与利用之间存在不平衡，导致中间步骤信用分配不准确和过早熵崩溃，限制了模型性能

Method: ACPO框架包含轨迹语义分割和基于归因的表征来动态调节策略熵，同时使用分解奖励系统精确量化每个推理步骤的层次贡献

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等挑战性基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: ACPO通过改进探索和利用的平衡，有效解决了RLVR中的关键问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个频域分析框架，将多臂赌博机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信区间项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂赌博机分析主要从时间域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来更好地理解探索与利用的权衡。

Method: 构建频域赌博机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，其不确定性对应分量频率，将赌博机算法解释为自适应滤波器。

Result: 证明了UCB算法的置信区间项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益，该增益与访问次数的平方根成反比，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态界限。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量示例后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后性能更稳定。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方案能有效改善车联网中的信息年龄性能，LLM具有快速部署优势，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Method: 通过表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景的比较中，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）具有更高的准确性和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为小地球数据的时空预测提供了一种简单而鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效处理不同场景下的预测任务。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，能够捕捉不同尺度的解特征，防止收敛到不希望的局部最小值。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTR模型研究主要集中在训练阶段优化，忽视了推理阶段的优化机会。低频特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠输出。

Result: 广泛的离线实验和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够释放已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and

*Zhen Yang,Yansong Ma,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Meta-Policy Controller (MPC)框架，通过元学习动态调整KL散度系数和Dirichlet先验强度，解决传统EDL方法在动态数据分布下校准和泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统证据深度学习(EDL)方法依赖静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化方法：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的Dirichlet先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，改善了不确定性校准、预测准确率以及基于置信度的样本剔除后的性能保持。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态元学习机制有效解决了EDL方法在动态环境中的校准和泛化问题，提出的可学习Dirichlet先验能够灵活适应类别分布和训练动态。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出VARNN模型，通过显式学习预测残差的误差记忆来重新校准后续预测，提高时间序列回归在非平稳和异方差环境下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时间变化噪声，这些会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性

Method: VARNN是一种残差感知架构，通过前馈预测器结合学习到的误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移的信号，并调节当前时间步的最终预测

Result: 在多个领域数据集上的实验结果表明，VARNN在静态、动态和循环基线模型上实现了更优的性能和更低的测试MSE，且计算开销最小

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，展示了其作为时间序列学习框架的潜力

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

TL;DR: LAGA是一个多智能体框架，通过检测、规划、行动和评估四个协作智能体，系统性地优化文本属性图的数据质量，解决传统GNN和LLM增强GNN在稀疏、噪声和不平衡场景下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本属性图(TAGs)的性能对输入质量高度敏感，现有方法主要关注模型架构改进而忽视数据本身的系统优化，导致实际效果有限。

Method: 提出LAGA框架，包含四个协作智能体：检测、规划、行动和评估。行动智能体采用双编码器和三目标设计，捕捉跨模态互补信息并进行整体图质量增强。

Result: 在九个场景下的实验表明，LAGA提高了图质量，并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和鲁棒图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Motivation: 传统的基于变分自编码器的贝叶斯优化方法存在重建目标函数导致潜在空间与原空间功能分布不匹配的问题，从而影响优化性能。

Method: 提出HiBBO框架，在VAE潜在空间构建中引入HiPPO（长序列建模方法）来确保空间一致性，减少分布不匹配。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了高维序列表示学习与高效贝叶斯优化之间的差距，为神经架构搜索、材料科学等领域提供了更广泛的应用可能。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索正则化器是否可以被学习，挑战传统显式正则化的必要性。

Method: 在标准基准测试（MNIST、FMNIST、CIFAR）上使用MLP、MLP-Relu和CNN等神经网络，比较有正则化和无正则化的学习优化器的性能。

Result: 正则化的学习优化器在测试准确率和泛化能力方面持续优于未正则化的版本，并且能够将正则化效果保留并迁移到新的优化任务中。

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够固有地学习正则化特性，挑战了传统显式优化目标正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了强化学习集成奖励方法(RLER)，通过聚合多样化模型和自适应奖励插值与轨迹选择，解决了RLIR中模型对高置信度轨迹过度奖励导致的系统偏差问题，在无标注样本上实现了稳定扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR受限于标注样本数量，而RLIR在无标注设置中虽然能持续扩展，但其性能和稳定性落后于RLVR，主要原因是模型对高置信度轨迹的过度奖励导致系统偏差。

Method: 提出了RLER方法，通过集成多样化模型、自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择来缓解系统偏差。使用三个指标(ρ_noise、ρ_selfbias、ρ_symbias)来表征偏差，其中ρ_noise和ρ_symbias影响收敛，ρ_selfbias放大正确和错误更新导致不稳定。

Result: 实验显示RLER相比RLIR提升了13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标注样本上实现了稳定扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效缓解了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标注样本上实现了接近RLVR的性能，具有很高的应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

TL;DR: 提出FedL2T个性化联邦学习框架，通过双教师知识蒸馏策略解决癫痫预测中数据异质性问题，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且存在隐私限制。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在真实场景中由于患者间差异导致性能不稳定

Method: 使用双教师知识蒸馏策略，每个客户端同时从全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型学习，采用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和特征表示，并引入近端正则化增强训练稳定性

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T优于现有FL方法，特别是在低标签条件下表现突出，且收敛快速稳定，减少了通信轮次和开销

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景提供了可靠且个性化的癫痫预测解决方案

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T)框架，通过(intent, constraint)对结构化表示来引导蒙特卡洛树搜索，解决LLMs在多步规划中与用户意图对齐和满足符号约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等虽然扩展了搜索空间，但经常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，无法确保计划与高层用户意图对齐并满足符号约束。

Method: 使用(intent, constraint)对结构化表示每个推理步骤，压缩搜索空间并强制有效性，将Const-o-T集成到MCTS中，通过约束修剪不可行分支并引导探索。

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域验证，该方法优于基线，获得更高准确率和更强的结构对齐。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLMs能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域自适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Conclusion: PlatformX提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够自动设计出在边缘设备上高效运行的深度神经网络。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

Conclusion: SQS框架通过同时优化剪枝和量化，实现了更高效的神经网络压缩，为资源受限设备部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法假设能获得干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，但现实中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、重写或带水印的，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘数据集上评估最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO，并提出基于显著性的解释框架来分析遗忘鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动具有惊人的鲁棒性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。关键语义成分在表面形式变化下仍保持一致的遗忘影响力。

Conclusion: 遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导，这解释了在噪声遗忘数据下的鲁棒性现象。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构的大模型容易受到极端token现象（如注意力汇和值状态流失）的影响，这些问题会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，源于模型学习到的一种低效的'无操作'行为。

Method: VGA引入一个直接从值向量(V)计算的可学习、数据依赖的门控来调制输出，通过值状态自身的函数进行门控，比之前基于输入嵌入的门控方法更有效地解耦值和注意力分数的更新。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇的形成并稳定了值状态范数，带来了性能提升、鲁棒的量化保真度和增强的模型可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的相互强化循环，提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制来高效执行'无操作'注意力。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型，忽略了适应异构硬件和运行时条件变化的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪婪调度器处理请求批处理和实例缩放，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比、批配置），降低搜索空间复杂度。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在准确率降至最瘦模型(70.3%)时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；也可在提高准确率的同时降低平均延迟和能耗，但延迟和能耗的标准差会增加。

server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

TL;DR: MagicDock是一个用于从头配体设计的框架，通过梯度反演和可微分表面建模来解决现有方法的局限性，在蛋白质和分子配体设计上分别比现有最优方法提升了27.1%和11.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有配体设计方法存在伪从头设计、对接建模有限和配体类型不灵活等问题，需要开发更有效的从头配体设计框架。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架，将受体和配体的对接知识融入主干模型，通过结合预测实例化为反向梯度流来指导配体生成；使用可学习的3D点云表示进行可微分表面建模；为不同配体类型提供定制化设计并整合到统一框架中。

Result: 在9个场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock在蛋白质和分子配体设计上分别比现有最优方法平均提升了27.1%和11.7%。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过梯度反演和可微分表面建模有效解决了从头配体设计的关键挑战，为不同配体类型提供了灵活且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了近十年来AI系统训练的环境影响，发现即使采用优化策略，ML模型训练的环境影响仍在指数级增长，存在回弹效应。仅靠效率提升无法确保ML的可持续性，需要减少AI活动并质疑大规模频繁训练的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习性能提升，计算需求急剧增加，导致能源消耗和环境问题。研究旨在评估各种优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算过去十年中包括大语言模型在内的著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的生命周期分析。

Result: 发现两个关键趋势：显卡生产的影响持续增加；ML模型训练的能量消耗和环境影响呈指数增长，即使采用位置转移等减排策略，优化策略也无法减轻训练带来的影响，存在回弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，必须考虑硬件的整个生命周期而非仅使用阶段，同时需要减少AI活动并质疑资源密集型训练的规模和频率。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 当前语言模型防御评估存在缺陷，应使用自适应攻击者进行测试。通过系统优化技术，作者成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，攻击成功率超过90%。


<details>

Motivation: 现有语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，通常使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御能力。需要采用更强大的自适应攻击来评估防御效果。

Method: 系统调整和扩展通用优化技术，包括梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索，针对12种不同的防御方法进行攻击。

Result: 成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原始报告显示这些防御的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文所述的自适应攻击，才能做出可靠和令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

Motivation: 现有研究表明多种优化器都能找到接近全局最优解，本文从相反角度探讨：假设收敛到任意点，研究不同优化器的特征值滤波特性及其对优化结果的影响。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，分析一般半代数C²函数，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出了两种增强特征值滤波的新算法。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，标准梯度下降天然避免尖锐极小值，SAM算法更主动偏好宽盆地。新提出的算法能更有效地促进宽极小值。

Conclusion: 不同优化器本质上是特征值滤波器，其超参数决定了滤波特性。这一视角为理解优化器行为提供了新见解，并启发了更有效的算法设计。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

Result: 实验显示IGCARL比最先进方法成功率提高至少27.9%，显著增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性

Conclusion: IGCARL有效提升DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，解决了现有鲁棒方法的局限性

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在工业生产环境中，通过结合时间序列分割技术和异构集成方法提升异常检测性能。研究显示，在集成算法前应用分割作为预处理步骤，能够显著提高AUC-ROC指标从0.8599到0.9760。


<details>

Motivation: 在多元时间序列环境中，分割技术能够识别状态变化，减少时间不确定性，从而改善异常检测。特别是在工业生产的复杂场景下，准确检测正常与异常状态之间的转换至关重要。

Method: 采用变化点检测（CPD）算法如ChangeFinder进行时间序列分割，作为异构集成（包括PCA、LSTM、随机森林和XGBoost）的预处理步骤。通过分割减少时间模糊性，帮助监督学习算法更好地学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，应用分割预处理后，异构集成算法的性能显著提升，AUC-ROC从0.8599（PCA和LSTM集成）提高到0.9760（随机森林和XGBoost）。

Conclusion: 时间序列分割作为预处理步骤能够有效减少时间模糊性，提升监督学习算法在异常检测中的性能。未来工作将探索结合变化点研究的加权特征，进一步优化早期异常检测模型。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Motivation: 传统CTC解码器在资源受限环境中面临计算和内存瓶颈，在系统处理中占用高达90%的时间，主要由于详尽的token级操作效率低下。

Method: 提出FLToP CTC算法，采用基于相对概率阈值的帧级token剪枝策略，动态剪除每帧中的低概率token。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，FLToP CTC相比标准CTC解码器实现10.5倍运行加速和2.78倍内存减少，WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Motivation: 脑电图等生物信号记录产生高维、噪声时间序列数据，通常需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。需要开发有效的表示学习方法来解码和解释这些生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散令牌。在数千小时脑电图数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号类型。

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号令牌化提供了一个多功能解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Method: 采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不需要完整动量，通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减少性能损失。

Result: 经验验证在60M到1.5B语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中，减少90%以上动量内存，结合二阶统计量技术可进一步减少95%优化器状态内存，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省30%以上GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM通过自适应部分动量设计有效解决了大型语言模型训练中的内存瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on

Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法增强了差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性，通过更准确的隐私风险评估和算法改进来减少群体间的隐私风险差异。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Motivation: 解决在对抗性延迟反馈环境下的上下文多臂老虎机问题，其中损失观测可能被对手延迟，这对实际应用具有重要意义。

Method: 使用有限策略类直接访问和一般函数逼近两种方法，后者通过在线最小二乘回归预言机实现，并分析了基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性。

Result: 在有限策略类下获得最优期望遗憾界O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；在函数逼近设置下获得O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))，其中β ≤ log|F|。

Conclusion: 论文为延迟反馈CMAB问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，在有限策略类下达到最优，在函数逼近设置下与下界相差√d_max因子。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地从有限的人类比较数据中估计复杂密度，为专家知识抽取和人类反馈学习提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

*Suming Qiu,Jing Li,Zhicheng Zhou,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和稳定优化更新，在提升领域性能的同时缓解遗忘问题，并降低40%以上的训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域适应中面临的困境：提升专业领域能力往往以牺牲通用能力为代价。现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录覆盖概率阈值的动态Top-K token子集（始终包含正确标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失。同时设计MoClip优化器，限制梯度动量旋转并基于arctan2重新缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术(CT)和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，同时在通用基准(MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH)上缓解遗忘问题，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs的领域适应提供了一条可扩展、架构无关的路径，且不牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR是一个通过多轮强化学习实现大语言模型与知识图谱协同进化的框架，解决了静态知识库的覆盖不足和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态知识库，存在覆盖不全和时效性差的问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统、可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法，通过多轮强化学习实现LLM与KG的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识抽取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG集成后在问答任务中取得更优性能，准确率和知识覆盖率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过协同进化机制有效解决了知识库的静态局限性，为动态知识增强提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个系统性的EHR表示方法基准测试，比较了多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流三种范式，发现在不同临床场景下事件流模型表现最佳，且特征选择策略需要根据临床环境进行调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)支持临床预测的深度学习应用，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确，需要系统性的基准测试来指导方法选择。

Method: 构建统一基准测试，在MIMIC-IV(ICU任务)和EHRSHOT(纵向护理)两个临床环境中标准化数据整理和评估，比较时间序列(Transformers、MLP、LSTM、Retain)、事件流(CLMBR、计数模型)和文本事件流(8-20B LLMs)三种表示方法，并分析基于数据缺失的特征剪枝影响。

Result: 事件流模型始终表现最强，预训练模型CLMBR在少样本设置中样本效率高，而简单计数模型在数据充足时具有竞争力。特征选择策略需适应临床环境：剪枝稀疏特征改善ICU预测，但保留这些特征对纵向任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，研究结果为基于临床环境和数据制度选择EHR表示方法提供了实用指导，强调了事件流模型的优越性和特征选择策略的情境依赖性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: WASI是一种基于子空间的训练方法，通过将训练限制在固定子空间内，显著降低transformer模型的内存占用和计算成本，同时保持与标准训练相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的应用日益广泛，能耗和数据隐私成为紧迫问题。设备端学习虽然能降低能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络规模的扩大对设备端训练构成了主要障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到transformer模型，提出Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI)，通过将训练限制在模型关键信息所在的固定子空间内，缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈并提升推理效率。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确率的同时，将内存使用降低高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)降低高达2倍。在Raspberry Pi 5上，WASI实现了约1.5倍的训练和推理加速。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了transformer模型在设备端训练中的内存和计算瓶颈问题，为能耗敏感和数据隐私保护的应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Motivation: Git Re-Basin是一种新的模型合并方法，但需要更深入的分析和改进。

Method: 提出了分层模型合并方案，比标准MergeMany算法更优。

Result: 分层合并使模型获得对抗性和扰动鲁棒性，且参与合并的模型越多效果越强，但性能下降比原作者报告的要大。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin方法能提升模型鲁棒性，但实际性能下降比预期严重，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GCM框架，通过全局约束学习功能脑网络的高阶结构，在5个数据集和2种任务设置下相比基线方法提升30.6%准确率并减少96.3%计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有功能脑网络建模主要依赖局部成对交互，难以捕捉高阶依赖关系；同时当前超图建模方法计算负担重且启发式，无法从数据分布中端到端学习网络结构。

Method: 提出全局约束导向的多分辨率(GCM)框架，整合4种全局约束（信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签）来学习4个不同分辨率水平（样本/被试/组/项目）的功能脑网络结构。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置下，相比9个基线和10个最先进方法，GCM实现了相对准确率提升30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%。

Conclusion: GCM为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Motivation: 深度学习中存在非确定性和不可重现性问题，这些问题源于随机数生成和浮点计算。虽然随机性可以通过确定性配置控制，但浮点不一致性仍未解决。

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制正确的浮点数舍入和顺序不变性来实现确定性和比特级可重现的深度学习训练和推理。

Result: RepDL能够确保深度学习训练和推理在不同计算环境中的确定性和比特级可重现性。

Conclusion: RepDL成功解决了深度学习中的浮点计算不一致性问题，提供了跨平台的可重现性解决方案。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习的目标是实现类似人类的持续学习能力，但其核心挑战灾难性遗忘的深层机制尚未被完全理解。本文旨在揭示灾难性遗忘的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论分析发现新任务训练是隐式的对抗攻击，新任务梯度会自动与旧任务损失的陡峭方向对齐。提出backGP方法来减轻由反向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: backGP方法在GP方法基础上平均减少遗忘10.8%，提高准确率12.7%。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘源于新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，backGP方法能有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法局限于文本领域，无法充分利用多模态大语言模型的潜力，需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出MPO框架，通过保持对齐的联合更新来优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯选择策略基于先前评估指导候选提示选择。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤，MPO为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Motivation: 流匹配模型在模仿学习中表现出色，但由于缺乏环境交互和探索，在未见场景中泛化能力差。直接在线优化FM策略面临梯度不稳定和高推理成本的挑战。

Method: 使用简单的MLP学生策略进行在线探索和RL更新，教师FM模型提供奖励信号并正则化学生行为，结合了FM的表达能力和RL的探索优势。

Conclusion: 通过将FM的表达能力与RL的在线探索相结合，该方法有效克服了FM策略在线学习的局限性，实现了更好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: 金融机器学习模型容易因数据分布变化而性能下降（模型漂移），这在经常经历不可预测宏观经济冲击的发展中经济体（如中亚和高加索地区）尤为严重。目前缺乏对这些地区金融数据集漂移缓解方法的研究。

Method: 研究使用合成异常值这一较少探索的方法来提高模型对意外冲击的稳定性，并引入一个两级评估框架来衡量性能下降程度和冲击严重性。

Result: 在宏观经济表格数据集上的实验表明，添加小比例的合成异常值通常比基线模型提高了稳定性，但最佳添加比例因数据集和模型而异。

Conclusion: 合成异常值可以作为缓解金融机器学习模型漂移的有效方法，特别是在发展中经济体金融数据集中，但需要根据具体数据集和模型调整使用策略。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体模仿学习中存在的理论空白，特别是非交互式方法的局限性和交互式方法的样本复杂度优化问题。

Method: 在非交互式设置中，证明了统计下界并识别了全策略偏差集中系数；在交互式设置中，提出了结合无奖励强化学习与交互式MAIL的框架，并实例化为MAIL-WARM算法。

Result: MAIL-WARM算法将样本复杂度从O(ε⁻⁸)提升到O(ε⁻²)，与理论下界匹配；数值实验显示在网格世界等环境中，行为克隆方法会失败而MAIL-WARM能成功学习。

Conclusion: 本文为多智能体模仿学习建立了完整的理论框架，证明了非交互式方法的根本限制，并提供了样本复杂度接近最优的交互式解决方案。

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的黑盒安全对齐框架，通过博弈论方法在推理时平衡安全性和有用性，无需重新训练或访问模型内部。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法需要重新训练或访问模型内部，成本高且不灵活，不适合第三方利益相关者。需要一种黑盒、无需重新训练的安全对齐方案。

Method: 将安全与有用性的权衡建模为两人零和博弈，使用线性规划求解器在推理时计算均衡策略，实现最优平衡。

Result: 证明了黑盒安全对齐的可行性，为资源受限的组织提供了可扩展的安全执行途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速发展的LLM生态系统提供了可访问的安全对齐解决方案，特别适合小型组织和资源受限环境。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人类评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ模型，显式建模评分者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为XGeoAI的新框架，用于实时、可解释的多步列车延误预测。该框架采用两阶段自回归图注意力网络模型，在荷兰铁路网络数据集上验证，在延误事件分类精度方面优于基准模型。


<details>

Motivation: 铁路网络的运营效率受到列车延误级联效应的持续影响。现有研究虽然使用图神经网络建模铁路网络结构，但缺乏能够提供网络范围多步自回归预测，同时提供实时可解释解释的框架，这对决策支持至关重要。

Method: 开发了两阶段自回归图注意力网络模型，将系统表示为运营事件（到达和出发）的时空图，并包含平台和车站拥堵等细粒度特征。使用顺序k步前向预测协议进行严格评估，模拟真实世界条件。

Result: 虽然提出的GATv2模型在纯误差指标上被更简单的持续性基准模型挑战，但在延误事件分类精度方面始终表现更高，这对于可靠的决策支持工具至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架在延误事件分类方面具有优势，为实时决策支持提供了有价值的工具，尽管在绝对误差指标上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Motivation: 探索在LLM预训练加速中，计算效率高的近似方法会损失多少性能，为大规模训练建立迭代复杂度的实际上限。

Method: 对最多150M参数的transformer模型应用完整高斯牛顿预条件处理，并与分层GN预条件器进行比较。

Result: 完整GN更新相比现有优化器带来显著收益，分层GN预条件器几乎匹配完整GN方法的性能。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件处理非常有效，分层Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在收益，当前近似方法与理想分层oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然softmax注意力在序列模型中表现优异，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方案如SSMs的效率提升机制尚不明确，需要系统比较不同注意力机制的信息处理方式。

Method: 使用动力系统框架表示各种注意力机制，通过分析特征值谱与SSMs进行结构化比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响记忆和长程依赖建模的关键方面，发现了与任务需求一致的光谱特征，架构修改对特征值谱和任务性能的影响存在对应关系。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解和改进序列模型能力提供了原则性度量标准，强化了其在模型分析中的重要地位。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别中的课程学习方法依赖启发式、数据驱动或模型驱动的难度定义，忽略了人类感知难度这一在主观任务中至关重要的因素。

Method: 提出CHUCKLE框架，通过众包数据中标注者的一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类具有挑战性的样本对机器学习模型同样困难。

Result: 实验结果显示，CHUCKLE使LSTM模型的相对平均准确率提高了6.56%，Transformer模型提高了1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE框架通过结合人类感知难度，在情感识别任务中有效提升了训练效率和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

TL;DR: 提出HINT框架解决RL训练中因任务难度超过模型能力导致的奖励稀疏和训练效率低下问题，通过提供启发式提示而非直接答案来提升模型自主推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法如GRPO在任务难度超过模型能力时会出现奖励稀疏和训练效率低下的问题，先前工作使用离策略数据（如混合RL与SFT或使用提示）往往误导策略更新。

Method: 引入Affinity指标监控探索效率和训练稳定性，提出HINT自适应提示框架，提供启发式提示而非直接答案，引导模型自主发现解决方案。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的广泛实验表明，HINT持续优于现有方法，在不同规模模型上取得最先进结果，同时展示更稳定的学习和更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: HINT框架通过改善训练亲和力，有效解决了RL训练中的分布不匹配问题，提升了模型推理能力和训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了近期设计的经验成功，还为系统设计新序列模型架构提供了指导原则，连接了近期文献中的多个见解和观察。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效分离真实硬件签名与接收器伪影，确保对接收器变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Conclusion: 研究结果为时序图学习模型的应用提供了实用见解，并推动了时序图学习研究中更注重可解释性的评估方法。

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Motivation: 权重初始化在训练开始时控制信号传播和梯度流动，对训练稳定性和收敛速度至关重要，需要理论支持和实证验证。

Method: 采用对数扫描初始标准差来识别消失和爆炸区域，对比Kaiming和Xavier初始化效果，并在12层GPT-2风格模型中追踪Q/K/V权重方差在预训练过程中的变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1标准差范围提供稳定训练；Kaiming初始化比Xavier收敛更快更稳定；Transformer浅层权重方差快速扩展，深层变化更渐进，形成深度依赖的窄带均衡。

Conclusion: 研究将经典初始化原则与现代Transformer行为联系起来，为鲁棒训练提供了简单实用的方法。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级无监督框架，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的token序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保留核心时序动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等信息，导致长序列或噪声序列中的效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。

Method: 使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多时间分辨率的变化点，然后用均值或GMM等生成模型总结每个片段。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS能达到全模型性能的85-90%，同时显著降低计算成本，并在噪声下提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STaTS作为模型无关的预处理器，为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了一个原则性的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde

Motivation: 现有研究将交叉注意力解释为残差对齐机制，但其底层机制尚未完全理解。本文旨在探索交叉注意力在跨域序列推荐中的新对齐机制。

Method: 通过300多次实验分析交叉注意力的工作机制，发现当查询输入与交叉注意力输出正交时，模型性能显著提升，且正交对齐无需显式约束即可自然涌现。

Result: 实验表明正交对齐机制能提升模型性能，结合交叉注意力的基线模型在参数匹配条件下优于基线，实现了更好的准确率-参数比。

Conclusion: 正交对齐是交叉注意力中的自然涌现机制，能改善缩放定律，为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流（USFs）在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USFs等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测领域存在深度单类分类和密度估计两种主要范式，但两者之间的联系尚未明确。本文旨在通过均匀缩放流（USFs）建立这两种方法的理论桥梁。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流（USFs）——具有常数雅可比行列式的归一化流，证明其最大似然训练等价于Deep SVDD目标，并展示了如何将USFs集成到现代异常检测架构中。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试和模型骨干上，用USFs替代非USFs能带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测。

Conclusion: USFs统一了两种主要的异常检测范式，不仅推进了理论理解，还提升了实际性能，建议将USFs作为非USFs的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，基于LLM监控器的AI控制协议存在严重漏洞，攻击者可以通过嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入来规避监控，导致控制协议失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI控制协议将LLM监控器作为防御核心，但攻击者可能知晓协议和监控模型细节，从而发起适应性攻击。

Method: 研究适应性攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，利用监控模型的盲点。

Result: 前沿模型能够持续规避各种监控器，在两个主要AI控制基准上完成恶意任务。Defer-to-Resample协议甚至适得其反，其重采样机制放大了提示注入效果。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的适应性攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Motivation: 研究注意力机制中归一化的局限性，特别是softmax在token选择和几何分离方面的不足，为改进注意力架构提供理论基础。

Method: 建立理论框架分析注意力机制的选择能力和几何分离特性，通过预训练GPT-2模型进行实验验证，分析距离边界和分离标准。

Result: 随着选择token数量增加，模型区分信息性token的能力下降，趋向均匀选择模式；softmax归一化在低温设置下存在梯度敏感性挑战。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对softmax注意力机制的理解，表明需要开发更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略来改进未来注意力架构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Conclusion: MODE框架特别适合处理噪声模式转换，解决了计算生物学中的关键挑战

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

TL;DR: 使用CLSVOF方法数值研究方形微通道中气-剪切稀化液两相流，分析PAM浓度、表面张力、速度比和接触角对气泡长度、体积、单元长度和压降的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究剪切稀化液体在微通道两相流动中的特性，为分段流形成和两相流动特性提供基础见解。

Method: 采用耦合水平集和流体体积(CLSVOF)方法进行数值模拟，系统研究PAM浓度、表面张力、速度比和接触角等参数的影响。

Result: 气泡长度、体积和单元长度随PAM浓度增加而减小；接触角增大使气泡长度减小，形状从凸变凹；报告了不同PAM浓度下的速度和粘度分布。

Conclusion: 该数值研究为包含剪切稀化液体的分段流形成和两相流动特性提供了基础性见解。

Abstract: In this study, two phase gas-shear-thinning liquid flow in a square
microchannel is numerically investigated using the coupled level set and volume
of fluid (CLSVOF) methods. A systematic investigation is carried out to explore
the influence of polyacrylamide (PAM) concentration, surface tension, velocity
ratios, and contact angle on the gas slug length, volume, unit cell length, and
pressure drop. Three different concentrations of PAM solutions, which exhibit
shear-thinning behaviour are considered as the continuous phase. Gas slug
length, volume, and unit cell length decreased with increasing the PAM
concentration. Velocity and non-homogeneous viscosity distributions in the
liquid slug for three different PAM concentration solutions are reported. Gas
slug length decreases with an increase of the contact angle and the bubble
shape change from convex to concave. This numerical work provides the
fundamental insights in segmented flow formation and two-phase flow
characteristics comprising shear-thinning liquids.

### [332] [An investigation into the combined effect of steady and pulsatile flow within a wavy channel filled with an anisotropic porous medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08729)
*Sanchita Pramanik,Timir Karmakar*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文研究了各向异性多孔介质填充的对称波纹通道中稳态和脉动流动的影响，重点分析了各向异性渗透率比对波纹壁附近流动反转的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究各向异性多孔介质中流动反转现象，这对于质量传输、对流混合以及膜氧合器等设备的氧气传输优化具有重要意义。

Method: 采用摄动方法求解Darcy-Brinkman方程，假设通道宽度与波长之比很小（δ² ≪ 1），并求解到O(δ²)阶，同时假设λ²δ² ≪ 1，其中λ为各向异性渗透率比。

Result: 在稳态流动中，波纹壁波峰区域发生流动分离，形成循环区；在脉动流动中，涡旋在脉动周期的特定阶段瞬时形成，随后膨胀到主流中导致完全回流。

Conclusion: 稳态流动的循环对质量传输至关重要，能增强对流混合；而不同时间点的流动反转可以优化膜氧合器等设备中的氧气传输。

Abstract: We provide an analytical solution to examine the impact of steady and
pulsatile flow in a symmetric wavy channel filled with an anisotropic porous
medium. The flow inside the wavy channel with a porous substrate is governed by
the Darcy-Brinkman equation. We used the perturbation approach to ascertain the
solution to the problem, assuming that the ratio between the channel width and
the wavelength is very small (i.e., $\delta^2 \ll 1$). We solved the problem up
to $O(\delta^2)$ by assuming $\lambda^2 \delta^2 \ll 1$, where $\lambda$ is the
ratio of anisotropic permeability. Our primary objective is to investigate how
the anisotropic permeability ratio influences flow reversal near the crest and
trough of a wavy wall under both steady flow conditions and when a pulsatile
component is superimposed on the steady flow. In the case of steady flow, flow
separation occurs near the crest region of the wavy wall, leading to the
formation of recirculating zones where fluid becomes trapped. In contrast, for
pulsatile flow as well as combined effects of steady and pulsatile flow,
vortices form transiently at certain phases of the pulsation cycle.
Subsequently, these vortices bulge into the mainstream, resulting in a complete
backflow. We explored the approximate flow reversal zone using Darcy's
approximation theory far from the wavy wall. The flow recirculation associated
with steady flow is critical for mass transport and enhances convective mixing.
On the other hand, flow reversal at different time instances can optimize
oxygen transfer in devices such as membrane oxygenators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究部分填充多孔介质通道中的变粘度流动，增强实际应用价值，特别是针对动脉血流和生物糖萼模拟系统。

Method: 使用迭代方法求解非线性Brinkman-Forchheimer方程，结合正则摄动法和匹配渐近展开处理高低达西数情况，采用ALMM-BNN神经网络预测中间参数范围。

Result: 高低达西数情况下渐近解与数值结果吻合良好，中间参数范围ALMM-BNN能捕捉整体趋势并与数值结果定性一致。

Conclusion: ALMM-BNN范式在数值解难以获得或计算昂贵的参数范围内具有强大预测潜力，为动脉血流剪切应力分布和糖萼支架设计提供理论支持。

Abstract: This study examines Couette-Poiseuille flow of variable viscosity within a
channel that is partially filled with a porous medium. To enhance its practical
relevance, we assume that the porous medium is anisotropic with permeability
varying in all directions, making it a positive semidefinite matrix in the
momentum equation. We assume the Navier-Stokes equations govern the flow in the
free flow region, while the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy's equation
governs the flow inside the porous medium. The coupled system contains a
nonlinear term from the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation. We propose an
approximate solution using an iterative method valid for a wide range of porous
media parameter values. For both high and low values of the Darcy number, the
asymptotic solutions derived from the regular perturbation method and matched
asymptotic expansion show good agreement with the numerical results. However,
these methods are not effective in the intermediate range. To address this, we
employ the artificial Levenberg-Marquardt method with a back-propagated neural
network (ALMM-BNN) paradigm to predict the solution in the intermediate range.
While it may not provide the exact solutions, it successfully captures the
overall trend and demonstrates good qualitative agreement with the numerical
results. This highlights the potential of the ALMM-BNN paradigm as a robust
predictive tool in challenging parameter ranges where numerical solutions are
either difficult to obtain or computationally expensive. The current model
provides valuable insights into the shear stress distribution of arterial blood
flow, taking into account the variable viscosity of the blood in the presence
of inertial effects. It also offers a framework for creating glycocalyx
scaffolding and other microfluidic systems that can mimic the biological
glycocalyx.

TL;DR: 气泡夹带仅发生在射流出口附近的特定区域，由射流出口速度而非雷诺数决定。射流形态（幕状射流和柱状射流）对临界气泡夹带速度影响很小，气泡夹带主要由剪切力和不稳定性驱动。

Motivation: 研究湍流水射流在自由表面附近的气泡夹带现象，探究其发生机制和影响因素。

Method: 实验研究，分析射流出口速度、雷诺数、弗劳德数和喷射角度对气泡夹带的影响。

Result: 气泡夹带仅发生在射流出口附近区域，由射流出口速度决定；射流形态对临界夹带速度影响很小；气泡夹带由剪切力和Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性驱动。

Conclusion: 气泡夹带主要由射流出口速度和表面不稳定性决定，毛细力会抑制远距离的气泡夹带，为湍流射流中气泡夹带机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of air entrainment in turbulent water jets
exiting a pool near the free surface. Our experimental results reveal that
bubble entrainment occurs only within a specific region close to the point
where the jet exits the water and is dictated solely by the jet's exit
velocity, rather than the Reynolds number. The morphology of the jet above the
pool surface, influenced predominantly by the Froude number or the injection
angle, classifies the flow into two regimes: curtain jet and column jet.
However, variations in jet morphology have minimal impact on the critical
velocity required for bubble entrainment. Our findings suggest that bubble
entrainment is driven by the dynamic interplay of shear forces and
instabilities. As the jet exits the nozzle, it interacts with the surrounding
fluids, amplifying instabilities through Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanisms. These
disturbances generate intense fluctuations on the jet surface, creating
localized low-pressure zones that trap air and entrain bubbles. As the jet
progresses further into the air, capillary forces dampen surface instabilities,
diminishing the jet's capacity to sustain bubble entrainment at longer
distances. This study offers new insights into the mechanics of air entrainment
in turbulent water jets, emphasizing the role of injection velocity and
instabilities in the entrainment process.

Motivation: 人工滑翔机在流体中沉降时需要精确导航到达目标位置，但如何通过动态调整质心实现有效导航尚不清楚。

Method: 使用完全解析的直接数值模拟和强化学习，研究紧凑滑翔机在不同雷诺数下的导航策略。

Result: 发现两种最优导航策略：大雷诺数下通过快速翻滚产生惯性升力实现远距离移动；小雷诺数下通过保持倾斜姿态产生粘性力，但移动范围较小。

Conclusion: 滑翔机的最优导航策略强烈依赖于雷诺数，揭示了流体相互作用对导航策略选择的关键影响。

Abstract: Artificial gliders are designed to disperse as they settle through a fluid,
requiring precise navigation to reach target locations. We show that a compact
glider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its
centre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and
reinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow
the glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend
sensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature
of this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our
results explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$,
the glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its
orientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force,
which allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high
viscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its
centre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that
results in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller
than for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the
inertial lift force at large Re$_p$.

Motivation: 湍流对海洋中大于微生物的生命形式重新分配营养物至关重要，但深海湍流的三维发展尚未被研究。

Method: 在地中海2500米深的平坦海底安装近3000个高分辨率温度传感器阵列，持续监测三年，构建三维系泊阵列的时间序列数据，制作深海水流运动影片。

Result: 观测到三种湍流：1）地热加热引起的对流湍流（温度差约0.001°C）；2）斜向平流的暖水形成的湍流云（强度是地热湍流的3倍，出现时间约40%）；3）远离边界的弱湍流界面波破碎。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次在三维尺度上揭示了深海湍流的复杂动态，为理解深海物质和能量输运提供了新视角。

Abstract: Turbulence is indispensable to redistribute nutrients for all life forms
larger than microbial, on land and in the ocean. Yet, the development of
deep-sea turbulence has not been studied in three dimensions (3D). As a
disproportionate laboratory, an array of nearly 3000 high-resolution
temperature sensors had been installed for three years on the flat 2500-m deep
bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The time series from the half-cubic hectometer
3D mooring-array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep-sea water
motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001degrC, variable
convection-turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through
the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3
times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters
to pass in turbulent clouds. Besides turbulent clouds and seafloor heating,
movies also reveal weakly turbulent interfacial-wave breakdown that commonly
occurs in the open ocean far away from boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无特定研究问题的探索性发现创造了机会，需要支持假设狩猎过程。

Method: 引入AScience框架，将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现为ASCollab分布式系统，使用具有异质行为的LLM研究代理自组织成演化网络。

Result: 实验显示这种社交动态能够在多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评级结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路和提出新治疗靶点。

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社交结构化的代理网络能够大规模持续进行探索性假设狩猎。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中效果有限，因为存在非结构化地址、不完整地图和距离估算计算约束等问题。

Method: 开发了一个框架，利用LLMs根据政策标准对VRP生成的路线进行评判。通过生成、标注和评估400个案例来验证方法，比较开源和专有推理模型的性能。

Result: 开源LLMs识别路线问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型最高可达86%。LLM-based评估能够超越传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的VRP路线评估是一种有效且可扩展的评估层，有助于提高最后一公里物流的成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态场景中适应性有限。需要统一框架来确保预测与控制的紧密对齐。

Method: 采用统一的内存增强世界模型，集成视觉预测和规划于单一多模态自回归主干中，使用分层记忆机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的原则性步骤，证明了统一框架在视觉导航中的有效性。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Motivation: 现有使用LLM设计启发式算法的方法不够鲁棒，需要工具来解释启发式算法表现不佳的原因并提供改进建议。

Method: 采用三个简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门设计。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例分析和针对性设计，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过分离战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理来解决LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，但LLM代理容易因小错误累积、产生幻觉或失去连贯性。上下文管理成为核心瓶颈，导致代理忽视关键证据或被无关信息分散注意力。

Method: COMPASS框架包含三个专门组件：(1)主代理执行推理和工具使用；(2)元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预；(3)上下文管理器为不同推理阶段维护简洁相关的进度简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个挑战性基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化设计有效解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并通过测试时扩展和训练后管道进一步提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要了解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是测量评估者之间的归因偏见。

Method: 使用雷蒙·格诺的《风格练习》进行对照实验。研究1比较人类参与者和AI模型在盲测、准确标记和反事实标记三种条件下评估文学段落。研究2测试偏见在14×14矩阵的AI评估者和创作者之间的普遍性。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见，是人类的2.5倍。研究2证实这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在。归因标签导致评估者反转评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而获得相反评价。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的这种倾向。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Motivation: 需要一种系统性的评估框架来全面评估智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行整个操作循环中的表现，并准确定位失败原因。

Method: 基于智能体操作循环（目标-计划-行动）构建评估框架，包含五个核心指标：目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度。使用LLM作为评判者，在两个基准数据集上进行验证。

Result: 该框架能覆盖TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集中的所有智能体错误，LLM评判者与人工标注的一致性达到80%-95%以上，错误定位准确率达到86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架提供了一种系统化的智能体评估方法，能有效识别和定位智能体失败，为性能改进提供针对性指导。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted

*Gaurav Sahu,Hugo Larochelle,Laurent Charlin,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo是一个模块化框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助同行评审，通过系统化评估补充人类判断，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决同行评审中存在的不一致性、评审者主观性和可扩展性挑战，通过AI辅助提高评审的系统性和一致性。

Method: 开发模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持专业评审者角色和结构化评估标准的系统实验，可在真实会议工作流程中部分或完全集成。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文数据集上，gpt-oss-120b模型达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率，接近人类评审者83.9%的平均水平；AI生成的评审在LLM评估中质量高于人类平均水平。

Conclusion: AI在事实核查、文献覆盖方面表现出色，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足，需要与人类专家形成混合评审系统，提高一致性、覆盖面和公平性。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [345] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策整合到LLM的对齐过程中，通过构建收益矩阵和互惠奖励来优化模型与用户的交互，实现双赢结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就等于最大化用户福利，但实际上LLM经常产生过度澄清或冗长的回答，导致用户满意度下降，这类似于囚徒困境问题。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互视为战略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励机制，强化合作性回应；还包含基于博弈论的动态适应推理技术。

Result: 广泛实验表明，GTAlign在多种任务中显著提升了推理效率、回答质量和互惠福利，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的社会效率问题，实现了模型与用户的互利共赢。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了LM Fight Arena框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让大型多模态模型相互对战，评估它们在实时对抗环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法评估其在实时对抗环境中的性能，需要新的评估框架来测试模型的快速视觉理解和战术决策能力。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试了6个领先的开源和闭源模型，让每个模型控制相同角色以确保公平比较。模型需要解读游戏画面和状态数据来选择下一步行动。

Result: LM Fight Arena提供了一个完全自动化、可重复且客观的评估方法，能够测试LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与交互娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分记忆性回答和推理性回答来检测LLM数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染导致LLM评估不可靠，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非真正推理来获得高分。

Method: 提取37个特征，包括表面置信度轨迹和深层机制特性（注意力专业化、电路动态、激活流模式），使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，清晰案例完美检测，困难模糊案例76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性有潜力推动LLM评估超越传统表面指标。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估多模态RAG管道的基准，包含93个问题数据集、短语级召回指标、幻觉检测方法，并比较了开源与闭源管道的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索的特定方面，缺乏对整个RAG管道在多模态信息处理能力的综合评估。

Method: 创建包含文本、表格、图像等多模态数据的问题数据集，开发短语级召回指标和基于最近邻嵌入的幻觉分类器，进行开源与闭源管道的对比评估。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上差距更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 该基准能有效评估RAG管道的多模态信息处理能力，闭源模型表现更好，为RAG系统开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于认知神经科学启发的实体中心知识图谱RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据实现轻量级索引，相比其他结构化RAG系统减少94%的token消耗，并通过多跳关联搜索和动态关系推理实现复杂问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行多跳回忆的认知神经科学研究启发，旨在开发更高效的复杂问答系统。

Method: 在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据；检索阶段从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，并动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，平均精确匹配分数从0.392提升到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 验证了实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答中的有效性，为高效知识检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题，在科学推理基准上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度研究框架存在的三个主要问题：上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和脆弱的执行路径，这些限制了多步骤科学推理的效果。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：编码稳定背景知识的广度语义图和捕获执行来源的深度因果图。使用层原生相关性函数、种子锚定语义扩散和因果语义路径匹配。通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在HLE和GPQA科学推理基准上取得竞争性表现。使用InternAgent的日志文件，在HLE上准确率提升7.7%，在GPQA上提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch能够稳定有效地重建答案，将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，作为深度研究系统的补充。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)方法，通过图神经网络提取知识图谱的语义条件，自适应地调制文本嵌入，实现深度知识融合，显著优于传统的prefix-tuning方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有prefix-tuning方法简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入拼接，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的语义关系，给LLM带来了隐式推理负担。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用GNN从局部图邻域提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应调制文本嵌入。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于prefix-tuning和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供了更直接有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级3B多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快推理和更高准确率，统一了多任务多模态推理并减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在推理效率上面临模型尺寸大、过度思考、轻量场景准确率低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整响应优势，优先简洁高质量响应；第二阶段提出AMM训练自由模型合并方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化损失优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试中表现出色，涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力，使轻量模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功实现了轻量级模型在多模态推理任务中的高效表现，为轻量级MLLMs的发展提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估旅行规划时缺乏对可行性、可靠性和参与度的综合考量，需要更全面的评估框架来比较不同方法的规划质量。

Method: 构建包含4870个查询的大规模数据集，开发统一的评估器，通过GRPO等强化学习方法训练LLMs，并与多种基线方法进行比较。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM-as-judge基线；RL方法在基础模型上普遍提升了行程的可行性，获得了更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的统一基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，强化学习方法在提升规划可行性方面展现出优势，为更可靠的旅行规划系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估它们对证明的评分能力，包括检测错误、判断严重程度以及分配公平分数。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena数据集，引入智能体工作流程提取参考解决方案并自动推导问题特定的评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合符号分析和LLM的优势来修复正则表达式ReDoS漏洞，解决了现有方法在精度和泛化性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式在现代计算中广泛应用，但存在ReDoS漏洞。现有修复方法面临两难：基于符号规则的方法精确但无法处理复杂模式，LLM方法泛化性好但可靠性不足。

Method: 采用混合框架：首先用确定性符号模块定位易受攻击的子模式，然后调用LLM为隔离的片段生成语义等效的修复方案。

Result: 成功解决了规则修复方法无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比现有最优方法提高了15.4个百分点。

Conclusion: LRR框架为自动修复问题提供了经过验证的方法论，有效结合了LLM的泛化能力和符号方法的可靠性。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于GUI代理的连续记忆机制，通过VLM编码轨迹为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，在长序列任务和分布偏移下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将过去轨迹压缩为文本token，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如精确的控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来提升跨陌生界面和长序列任务的泛化能力。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入序列，直接插入主干网络的输入层；引入自动扩展的数据飞轮机制，通过搜索发现新环境、合成任务、执行轨迹和验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度的增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长序列和分布偏移下持续提升成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制有效解决了GUI代理的上下文膨胀问题，通过保留视觉细节和低成本扩展记忆，显著提升了在复杂GUI任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Method: 基于精神分析原理开发了三种人工意识模块，设计了16种MBTI人格角色（包含需求、状态、记忆等属性），创建了10个不同情境来测试认知能力，采用调查评估、ChatGPT三级分类和定性评审三种方法评估决策过程。

Result: 定量和定性分析均表明模型能够较好地模拟人类意识，但不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不够显著。模型展示了在复杂认知情境下模拟人类意识的潜力。

Conclusion: 整合精神分析和人格理论的模型能够构建更直观、适应性更强的人工意识系统，为改善AI在复杂认知情境中的交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

*Joonghyuk Hahn,Soohan Lim,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEC³O是一个多专家共识系统，通过将LLMs分配到特定复杂度类别并让它们进行结构化辩论，有效预测代码时间复杂度，在CodeComplex数据集上表现优于开源基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码时间复杂度预测中难以在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，不同模型在不同类别上各有优势，需要一种整合多个模型专长的方法。

Method: 提出MEC³O多专家共识系统：1）根据性能将LLMs分配到特定复杂度类别；2）提供类别专业化指令；3）专家进行结构化辩论；4）通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%，在macro-F1上平均超过GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini的F1分数相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法在代码复杂度预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、推理时控制的方法，使基于流的文本到图像模型具有多样性感知能力，通过特征空间目标和正交随机扰动来提升生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，这种扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束使其能够增强变化而不降低图像细节或提示保真度。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上显示能单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边缘分布，为生成质量的鲁棒保持提供了原理性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法使用简单图描述复杂网络关系，只能捕获成对关系，而网络中可能存在丰富的非成对结构化关系。理论预测模型缺乏准确性，数据驱动预测模型缺乏可解释性。

Method: 引入动态超图学习捕捉复杂网络中的高阶非成对关系；提出物理数据双驱动动态预测模块，结合Koopman算子理论将非线性动力学微分方程转化为线性系统求解，利用物理信息神经微分方程确保动态演化符合物理规律。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态超图学习和双驱动预测模块，有效解决了复杂网络动态预测中高阶关系建模和可解释性问题，实现了准确且可解释的长期动态预测。

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在社交推理游戏中主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽视了说服性沟通在影响其他玩家信念和回应方面的重要性。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者的回应，并基于此提出强化学习框架来优化说服性话语。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行全面实验，证明所提出的智能体显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具备战略性社会影响力AI智能体的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色但计算成本高，现有动态切换方法缺乏性能损失统计保证，不适用于高风险应用

Method: 构建性能损失的单调函数置信上界，基于不确定性分数设定切换阈值，在分布无关方式下确保有界性能损失

Result: 在推理基准测试中，该方法能节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失

Conclusion: PAC推理方法为高效推理提供了统计保证，在高风险应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

TL;DR: LLMs在医疗咨询中存在系统性偏见，不同社会群体（特别是原住民和双性人）获得的医疗建议在可读性和复杂性上存在差异，且交叉群体中这种趋势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否会对不同社会群体产生偏见，特别是在医疗资源匮乏的环境中可能加剧健康不平等。

Method: 通过模拟不同性别、年龄和种族的患者档案向LLMs提出一系列临床问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者获得的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉群体的差异更加明显。

Conclusion: 需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保患者获得公平的医疗支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于PSPACE完全正则表达式问题的新基准，用于评估大语言模型和大推理模型的空间计算限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自然语言处理、数学推理和编程方面表现出色，但它们的计算限制，特别是受有限上下文窗口约束的空间复杂性，仍然缺乏深入理解。现有研究多关注NP复杂度问题，而PSPACE完全问题作为更严格的标准，需要大规模搜索空间探索。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建了一个包含超过百万个正则表达式实例的标记数据集，采用严格的过滤过程建立基准。对6个LLM和5个LRM进行了广泛评估。

Result: 评估揭示了常见的失败模式，如冗长和重复。这是首次对LLM和LRM空间计算限制的实证研究。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个评估高级推理能力的新框架，揭示了当前模型在PSPACE完全问题上的计算局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在需要透明度的监管领域中既要高性能又要可解释性的矛盾需求。

Result: 提供了严格的数学证明，当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Conclusion: 序列变量为车辆路径问题的约束编程建模提供了更直观和灵活的方法，能够有效处理可选访问和插入启发式算法，扩展了CP在VRP中的应用范围。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的代理系统为放射学工作流自动化提供了新机遇，但仍面临错误级联、工具使用效率和医疗IT集成等挑战，需要进一步研究和评估方法开发。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经符号AI框架难以扩展的问题，以及神经方法隐含表示和近似推理带来的可解释性和可信度限制。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个微小的图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT及其等效知识图谱形成模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象；符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT产生的知识图谱达到69.8% FActScore，而32B参数的基线LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱还获得68.8%的ValidityScore，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在实现最先进基准精度的同时，相对于基线具有优越的符号表示能力。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛问题的基准测试，每个问题平均有60个专家设计的测试用例，旨在解决现有编程基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在缺乏高难度问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线平台API限制可访问性等问题，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 从72个不同地区的官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的问题，每个问题配备详细子任务评分标准和大量私有测试用例，并整合精英选手表现数据进行对比。

Result: 在评估32个流行LLM后，GPT-5达到81.76百分位数，但仍低于顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位数），而开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位数。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先精确的问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.
