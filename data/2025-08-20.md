### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO11-CR轻量级目标检测模型，用于实时疲劳检测，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖或小目标检测困难等问题，需要开发非侵入式、鲁棒性强的实时检测方案

Method: YOLO11-CR模型包含卷积注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监控提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时序建模和多模态数据集成

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准测试和Mirage-R1模型，用于检测真实世界中的AI生成图像，在基准测试上领先现有方法5-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，这些图像可能来自多个生成模型并经过编辑处理

Method: 构建Mirage基准测试（包含互联网采集和专家合成的AI生成图像），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练，并使用推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准测试和公共基准测试上分别领先最先进检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准测试和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测的挑战，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来减少幻觉，在OCR任务上表现优于非推理模型和专家OCR模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析方面表现出色，但容易产生幻觉（生成输入图像中不存在的文本），且在OCR任务上不如专门训练的专家模型有效。

Method: 提出推理增强框架DianJin-OCR-R1：模型先利用自身OCR能力识别图像内容，然后调用其他专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并重新思考推理过程来提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验结果表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过推理和工具交织的方式有效减少了视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，并以较低成本提升了OCR性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络的两层级结构实现乌尔都语光学字符识别，通过组件基础分类和自动特征学习达到了高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种扇形文字，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的分割基于识别方法错误率较高

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)进行自动特征学习，通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，并使用连通组件技术获取细件，建立了两层级的层次神经网络处理不同程度的字符排列组合

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上达到了极高的准确率，成功实现了细件分类的准确率

Conclusion: 组件基础的CNN方法能够有效处理乌尔都语识别的挑战，避免了传统分割方法的高错误率问题

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量估计标签可靠性并结合有序分类，在溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像MES评分分类中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分(MES)分类面临标注噪声和有序性挑战，标准模型常忽略有序结构，需要同时考虑标签可靠性和有序性的方法

Method: 使用轻量级模型基于BBPS标签估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习，结合ResizeMix增强提高鲁棒性

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著超越监督和自监督基线，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略在标签不确定性下能有效提升有序分类性能，CLoE框架具有良好应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决步态识别中大规模标注数据缺乏、样本多样性不足以及隐私保护的问题。

Method: 训练视频扩散模型，专门处理步态轮廓数据，支持基于服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的可控生成，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 合成样本能提升步态识别性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份数据具有独特且一致的步态模式，可用于训练同时保护真实主体隐私。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了扩散模型在高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成方面的重要进展。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个即插即用的视觉token剪枝框架，用于自动驾驶中的多视角视觉语言模型，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大、推理延迟高和内存消耗大，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）基于最远点采样的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，根据每个摄像头视图对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，当仅保留10%视觉token时，预填充阶段实现6.4倍加速，FLOPs消耗降至原来的13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，为多视角VLM在自动驾驶中的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架：每阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，视觉质量指标（SSIM、LPIPS、FID）均有显著改善。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用强基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

application-relevant rankings. The top-performing methods leveraged deep
learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and
domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse
conditions.
  This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation
metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip
current segmentation. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges, lessons
learned from the submissions, and future directions for expanding RipSeg.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，模型仅通过视觉和选项就能猜出正确答案，无需问题。提出了GroundAttack工具生成困难负选项，创建了无偏数据集来更真实评估VLM能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有VQA基准存在严重偏差，模型可以通过视觉-选项相似性匹配直接推断答案，而不需要理解问题，这导致对视觉语言模型能力的评估不准确。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差原因，提出GroundAttack工具包自动生成视觉上合理的困难负选项，应用到NExT-QA和MMStar数据集创建无偏标注。

Result: 在无偏标注上，当前VLM在仅视觉+选项设置下准确率接近随机，在完整设置下准确率也显著下降，提供了更真实的模型能力评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的系统性偏差问题，提出的解决方案能生成更公平的评估数据集，有助于更准确地衡量视觉语言模型的真实问答能力。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了面部特征解耦和跨模态共享的问题，为说话头生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的MLP网络，导致编码多张图像时计算和存储效率低下。

Method: 分析训练好的INR网络层间权重分布，发现中间层具有高度相似的分布模式。因此共享这些中间层，同时保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征。

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可处理100张图像且平均PSNR达34dB。

Conclusion: MINR方法具有鲁棒性，能有效解决多图像编码的效率问题，在各种骨干网络上表现稳定。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。需要同时量化权重和激活值以充分利用量化带来的硬件优势

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1)分析发现首尾层权重和激活值分布与其他层不同；2)使用哈达玛变换将不同分布标准化为统一的钟形分布；3)应用标准量化器进行量化

Result: 在多种图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高提升98.3%，优于先前量化方法

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值量化问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了硬件效率

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习，有效提取了微表情的全方位特征，解决了精细空间-时间特征提取难题，为微表情识别领域提供了有效方案

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar

effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过系统性的表示学习方法有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，在特征区分度和簇紧凑性方面取得了显著改进

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE方法，使用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，集成了包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算适应性选择最优ISO和快门速度序列

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够有效解决动态场景中HDR重建的挑战，找到比传统方案更好的曝光策略，显著提升了HDR图像质量

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ实现了rFID 1.00的重建质量。通过增加2D高斯密度，进一步达到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的state-of-the-art重建性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过集成2D高斯分布提供了一种灵活权衡token效率和视觉丰富度的方法，在结构建模和重建质量方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Conclusion: 基于基础模型特征分布几何形状的转移性进行分布检验，是一种有效的方法，能够在联邦学习和长尾识别等具有挑战性的场景中提高模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部情绪识别在人类计算机交互和心理健康诊断中至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对视觉语言模型在低质量噪声数据环境下性能的系统评估，需要探索VLMs在此类任务中的实际表现和局限性。

Method: 提出新颖的评估流程，整合GFPGAN图像修复技术与FER评估，在FER-2013数据集（35,887张低分辨率灰度图像，7种情绪类别）上比较VLMs（Phi-3.5 Vision、CLIP）与传统模型（VGG19、ResNet-50、EfficientNet-B0）的性能。

Result: 传统模型显著优于VLMs：EfficientNet-B0达到86.44%准确率，ResNet-50为85.72%，而CLIP仅64.07%，Phi-3.5 Vision仅51.66%。同时提供了包含预处理、训练、推理和评估阶段的详细计算成本分析。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在低质量视觉任务中存在明显局限性，需要针对噪声环境进行适配优化。本研究为情绪识别领域提供了可复现的基准，强调了在实际部署中考虑模型适应性的重要性。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够生成更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，具有更好的表情可控性和细节保真度

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情感知和变形感知的设计，有效提升了3DGS基于头部虚拟人重建的质量和性能

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示缺乏频率选择性、空间定位和稀疏表示能力，过度依赖冗余信号分量，存在频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) WEGE编码机制，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数来显式指导频率信息

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法一致优于现有的隐式神经表示方法

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率和局部感知的机制有效解决了隐式神经表示中的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有的注视点渲染技术需要昂贵的硬件眼动追踪系统，限制了其广泛应用。本文旨在开发一种无需专用硬件的软件解决方案，降低成本和部署复杂度。

Method: 采用球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景，结合LSTM时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置。

Conclusion: 研究表明纯软件注视点预测可以用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码虽然性能优异，但模型参数过大、计算成本过高，限制了其在资源受限环境中的实际部署

Method: 双模式优化：架构重设（用更薄的卷积层替代传统3x3卷积）+操作精化（两阶段适配额额剪枝策略，训练时软剪枝识别冗余通道，训练后硬剪枝永久删除）

Result: 实验结果显示参数减少90.4%，计算节省88.9%，在感知质量指标上超过最新视频编码标准VVC

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持重建质量的前提下显著降低复杂度，为生成式人脸视频编码在移动边缘设备等资源受限环境中的高效部署提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Motivation: 解决SNN性能落后于CNN的问题，主要因是刺激数据信息容量有限，而现有使用非刺激输入的方法又违背了神经科学计算的原创意图

Method: 提出神经元样编码方法，根据生物神经元的内在运作原理和功能生成刺激数据，加入人工光感器层以含盖颜色和亮度信息

Result: 实验结果显示，这种受生物启发的方法有效增加了刺激信号的信息内容，提高了SNN的性能

Conclusion: 这种概念在未来发展中具有强大潜力，有助于克服神经科学计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督字典查找机制实现跨类别泛化，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知异常样本的先验知识，需要解决无需重新训练即可检测未见类别异常的问题。

Method: 提出三组件框架：1)字典构建-用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容；2)字典查找-通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常；3)查询判别正则化-通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力。

Result: 在七个工业和医疗数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify在3D人体姿态和形状估计中作为稳健基准，但其迭代优化过程计算成本高，限制了实用性。受跨领域进展启发，用数据驱动的神经网络替代迭代优化可以在不牺牲精度的情况下显著提升运行速度。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，通过时间采样策略构建初始化-目标对进行训练，采用以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，提高对不同动作和未见姿态的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基准，显著提升了3D人体姿态和形状估计的效率，同时保持了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计和简化模型结构，可以在不增加复杂性的情况下显著提升引用视频对象分割的质量。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，而相关数据集缺乏这些场景的数据，收集和标注成本迅明

Method: 提出了模拟、GAN基础和汇泰模型等多种数据生成流程，扩展现有GAN模型支持辅助输入，并结合模拟和实际图像进行训练，通过混合技术减少模型幻觉

Result: 在ACDC数据集上评测，语义分割性能整体提升1.85%，夜间场景下提升4.62%

Conclusion: 混合方法能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在极端条件下的视觉稳健性

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

TL;DR: 基于双重解耦设计的FoundationSSC框架，通过基础编码器提供语义和几何先验知识，使用专门化路径精炼，并通过轴向感知融合模块实现优异的3D语义场景完成性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖耦合编码器来提供语义和几何先验知识，这强刻模型在冲突需求之间做出折衷，限制了整体性能

Method: 提出双重解耦设计：源头级别使用基础编码器提供语义特征和立体成本体积，路径级别通过专门化路径精炼先验知识，使用混合视图变换生成补充性3D特征，并通过轴向感知融合模块进行合并

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上达到新的最佳性能，语义指标提升+0.23 mIoU，几何指标提升+2.03 IoU；在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到状态前沿性能，分别为21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过双重解耦设计有效解决了语义和几何先验知识的冲突问题，实现了同时在语义和几何指标上的显著提升，为自主驾驶和机器人导航提供了更优异的密集感知能力

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Method: 提出基于多模态大语言模型的多智能体协作框架，包含反馈和回滚机制，能够高效生成多模态内容创作的高质量提示，并通过迭代自校正提升内容质量。

Conclusion: PersonaVlog框架为自动化多模态风格化Vlog生成提供了有效解决方案，通过多智能体协作和迭代优化机制实现了高质量的个性化内容创作。

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在多模态图像旋转识别任务上表现不佳，特别是无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转，揭示了其空间推理能力与人类感知之间的显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在识别图像旋转方向方面的能力，评估其视觉推理和空间关系理解能力

Method: 构建RotBench基准测试(350张手动筛选图像)，测试多种先进MLLMs(GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等)在不同旋转角度(0°、90°、180°、270°)下的识别能力，并尝试辅助信息(标题、深度图)、思维链提示、多角度同时展示等改进方法

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别正立(0°)图像，部分能识别倒立(180°)图像，但都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示仅带来微小改善，微调也无法改善90°/270°区分能力

Conclusion: MLLMs在旋转识别任务上存在显著局限性，特别是在区分90°和270°旋转方面表现不佳，表明其空间推理能力与人类感知水平仍有较大差距

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面泛化能力不足，主要原因是训练数据缺乏足够的规模、质量和多样性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建分层评估集TalkVid-Bench（500个片段），在关键人口统计和语言维度上保持平衡。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于先前数据集训练的模型，展现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。TalkVid-Bench分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集解决了音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题，TalkVid-Bench评估集对于未来研究至关重要，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Result: 在标准数据集上验证，该方法不仅高效而且超越了之前的RGB基础方法的精度

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像的类别级物体始位估计提供了新的研究视角和推进方向

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中对引导权重选择高度敏感，存在训练与推理阶段的差距，这影响了生成样本质量并导致输出对引导权重的过度依赖。

Method: 提出DiffIER优化方法，在推理阶段的每一步进行迭代误差最小化，通过基于优化的框架减少累积误差，提升生成质量。

Conclusion: DiffIER是一个即插即用的优化框架，能够有效减少训练-推理差距，提高扩散模型的生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，解决了多类可穿戴物品试穿的挑战，为实际应用提供了有效的无掩码解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中表现出最先进的性能。在CityScale上比之前的SOTA方法RNGDet++提升了4.62 APLS和10.18 IoU，同时推理速度提高了约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了拓扑保真度和空间一致性的双重提升，同时显著提高了推理效率，为道路网络提取任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个评估多模态大模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的三层次评估套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层级，包含6000+人工验证的多选题和视频推理测试，评估显示现有模型在人类中心视觉理解方面仍面临重大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比性能，但现有基准测试经常忽视人类相关视觉上下文理解的关键技能。

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两者包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；后者提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据并主动提取上下文。每个问题都包含人工标注的思维链推理。

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心理建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取关键主动视觉证据方面表现挣扎，过度依赖查询引导的检索。即使使用扩展视觉上下文和测试时思考等先进技术，收益也有限。

Conclusion: HumanPCR评估套件和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和人类中心应用的发展，揭示了当前模型在人类相关视觉理解方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

TL;DR: 提出DCMamba框架，从数据、网络和特征三个角度增强多样性，用于半监督医学图像分割，在Synapse数据集上比现有方法提升6.69%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高且耗时，半监督分割技术通过利用未标注数据生成伪标签来缓解这个问题。最近的状态空间模型（如Mamba）在处理长程依赖方面表现出色，因此探索其在半监督医学图像分割中的潜力

Method: 1) 数据角度：开发基于Mamba扫描特性的patch级弱-强混合增强；2) 网络角度：引入多样扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3) 特征角度：采用不确定性加权的对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Result: 在Synapse数据集上，使用20%标注数据时，DCMamba显著优于其他半监督医学图像分割方法，比最新的SSM-based方法提升了6.69%

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过从多个角度增强多样性，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了状态空间模型在该领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育内容涉及农业等多个领域，需要有效组织和搜索方法。虽然Metaverse提供了互动沉浸式学习环境，但相关场景的搜索仍然面临挑战，现有数据集过小不适合训练高级模型

Method: 构建了457个农业主题虚拟博物馆的新数据集(AgriMuseums)，每个都包含文本描述，并提出了一个分层视觉-语言模型来表示和检索相关的AgriMuseums

Result: 在实验中达到了62% R@1和78% MRR的效果，证明了方法的有效性。同时在现有基准上实现了最多6% R@1和11% MRR的收益

Conclusion: 该研究为虚拟农业教育内容的组织和检索提供了有效的解决方案，通过新的数据集和模型设计显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPGA是一种针对视觉语言模型的新型对抗攻击方法，通过攻击投影器模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）来实现细粒度控制，在保持无关视觉内容的同时提高攻击效果和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在图像编码器层面进行全局扰动，将丰富的视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击的细粒度控制能力，且忽略了投影器模块在视觉-语言对齐中的关键作用。

Method: 提出Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA)，首次利用投影器模块中间阶段（Q-Former）进行攻击，将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度视觉特征；采用Residual Query Alignment (RQA)技术保持无关视觉内容；使用仅在第一阶段视觉语言对齐预训练的Q-Former，不进行LLM微调。

Result: 在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中，IPGA在黑盒环境下始终优于现有方法；成功迁移到多个商业VLM（Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT）。

Conclusion: IPGA通过攻击投影器中间阶段实现了更精确的对抗扰动控制，在攻击效果和可迁移性方面均有显著提升，为VLM安全性评估提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现优异，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互纠缠，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中均能一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人设计的6D姿态估计数据集，针对工业环境中大尺寸物体、远距离视角、复杂遮挡等挑战，填补了现有数据集主要关注小型家庭物体的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要针对机器人臂操作的小型家庭物体，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中的需求，如大尺寸物体、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化视角等挑战。

Method: 创建了包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，专门捕捉移动平台特有的挑战：远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计流程在这些设置下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍，表明现有方法难以应对移动机器人环境的特殊挑战。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了该领域的数据空白，数据集已公开提供使用。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多相机设置下的3D形状到2D关键点非粘性注册方法，通过几何约束和凸规划解决了多视角形状恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单相机Shape-from-Template(SfT)方法在医学成像等领域存在限制，多相机设置能够提供更多信息来提高形状恢复的准确性。

Method: 使用广义相机模型表示多相机设置，提出三种方法：知道空间点的方向向量法、未知空间点但知道方向的方法、以及结合边缘信息的方法。前两种使用凸规划，后一种使用迭代精炼。

Result: 在合成和实际数据上验证了方法的准确性，显示多视角信息能够显著提升形状恢复的性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决广义相机SfT问题的方法集，为医学成像和手持相机注册等应用提供了更准确的多视角3D形状恢复方案。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，要么使用神经网络建模导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限

Method: 双层优化框架：上层使用LLMs驱动的解耦本构演化策略生成和修订本构定律，下层使用视觉引导的本构评估机制通过视觉模拟评估一致性

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法并在新场景中展现强泛化能力

Conclusion: VisionLaw成功解决了内在动力学推断中的可解释性和泛化性挑战，为物理交互模拟提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到99% Dice分数和95% IoU，优于U-Net、ViT和Swin基线模型；消融研究表明临床文本对分割精度和解释质量至关重要；实现85% CLIP分数和3.2% ECE的良好多模态对齐和置信度校准。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过整合临床文本信息显著提升了乳腺癌超声分割的性能和可解释性，为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，在计算机辅助诊断中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for

radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated

in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗膜电位重用技术，在保持攻击成功率的同时将攻击延迟减少了超过56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于梯度的对抗攻击方法在间刻神经网络(SNNs)中存在攻击延迟过高的问题，这主要是因为它们是从人工神经网络(ANNs)直接扩展而来的，没有充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致在实际实时应用中不可行。

Method: 提出时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，包含两个核心组件：1)时间步级反向传播(TLBP)，基于发现生成干扰的反向传播中的全局时间信息并非攻击成功的关键，允许按时间步进行评估并提前停止；2)对抗膜电位重用(A-MPR)，基于观察到初始时间步效率低下地浇积膜电位，这个热身阶段可以预先计算并重用。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集进行实验，结果显示TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别将所需攻击延迟减少了最56.6%和57.1%，同时保持了相当的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过充分利用SNN的特有性质，有效解决了现有对抗攻击方法在SNN中攻击延迟过高的问题，为实际实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Method: 集成街道级别图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式进行无监督聚类，以估计属级生物多样性

Result: 在8个北美城市中高保真度恢复了属级多样性模式，Shannon和Simpson指数水沙距离低，保持了空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能在缺乏详细金字塔的城市实现生物多样性制图，支持低成本直接监测和城市生态系统的适应性管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show

TL;DR: 通过学习高成功率分布来提升文本到图像生成的准确性，避免缺失关键元素或概念混淆的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型在视觉效果上表现优异，但经常无法精确对齐文本提示，导致缺失关键元素或不期望的概念混合

Method: 学习一个高成功率分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号组件，提供细粒度控制，该方法无需训练且可与现有扩散和流匹配架构集成

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在性能上超过了当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成更准确对齐文本提示的图像，支持附加条件如边框来提升空间对齐，具有较强的实用性和扩展性

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的石材劣化模式识别依赖专家团队直接观察，虽然准确但耗时耗力，需要更高效的自动化解决方案

Method: 基于认知架构构建了包含5个专业AI智能体（岩性学家、病理学家、环境专家、修复师、诊断协调员）的多智能体系统，通过模拟专家协作来自动诊断石材病理

Result: 使用28张包含多种劣化模式的困难图像进行测试，系统在所有指标上都相比基础模型有巨大提升

Conclusion: 多智能体AI系统能够有效模拟专家协作，在石材病理诊断方面展现出显著优势，为文化遗产保护提供了高效的自动化工具

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两个现实性增量学习对象检测基准(RICO)，展现了现有IL方法在实际场景中的不足，发现重放少量旧数据的简单方法已超过所有IL方法，但仍不及分段训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习(IL)评估多使用简化的合成数据集，隐藏了IL在现实世界中的真实性能问题，需要更现实的评测标准。

Method: 构建了两个现实性增量学习对象检测基准(RICO)：域RICO(D-RICO)包含域假移但类别固定，扩展类别RICO(EC-RICO)每步集成新域和新类别。基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、多种条件、相机传感器和标注策略。

Result: 所有IL方法在适应性和知识保持方面都表现不佳；重放少量旧数据的简单方法已超过所有IL方法；但个别训练仍是最优解。

Conclusion: 现有IL方法在现实场景中存在显著稽差，应归因于识别教学中的弱教师、单一模型无法管理多样任务以及可塑性不足。需要更有效的方法来应对现实IL挑战。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新颖的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习临床相关特征而非虚假相关性，提高模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义特征，导致在分布偏移下泛化能力差。需要一种无需密集概念标注的方法来提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用小规模辅助数据集合成高质量解耦概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的潜在概念表示（如CAVs），通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在玩具数据集上显著提升对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中，在合成扰动和OOD泛化下均表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可有效提升模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测和后处理概念模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 博室用ConvLSTM空间时间神经网络预测南亚霾霉氟层氟素指数，实现5天预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚霾霉事件严重影响印度-干豆平原，但缺乏区域层面的实时氟层氟预测系统

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P数据(2019-2023)和ConvLSTM模型，以紫外氟层氟指数(340-380nm)作为预测因子

Result: 模型在5天预测间隔下平均方差错误~0.0018，损失~0.3995，结构相似性指数~0.74

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型能有效预测氟层氟指数，但需整合更多数据和优化模型结构来提升性能

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: SCRNet通过创新地结合卷积和交叉注意力机制，有效地解决了长程依赖和局部上下文信息的平衡问题，为医学图像分割领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Method: 首先联合优化高斯重建和概率化物理预测基础模型，然后使用物理可行参考视频精细化渲染保真性和物理预测准确性，采用DPO方法对齐模拟与参考视频，避免SDS优化的复杂梯度传播

Conclusion: PhysGM框架成功解决了现有方法的限制，通过联合预测3D表示和物理属性的前向传播方式，实现了高效、高保真的单图到4D动画生成

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

TL;DR: DIME-Net是一个双光照增强框架，通过混合专家机制自适应处理低光和背光图像，无需重新训练即可在多种光照条件下实现竞争性性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）会导致图像质量下降，影响下游视觉任务。现有方法大多只处理单一类型的光照退化，缺乏统一处理多样化光照条件的能力。

Method: 提出DIME-Net双光照增强框架，包含混合专家光照估计模块（使用稀疏门控机制自适应选择S曲线专家网络）和损伤修复模块（配备光照感知交叉注意力和序列状态全局注意力机制）。构建混合光照数据集MixBL进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，DIME-Net在合成和真实世界的低光和背光数据集上均取得了竞争性性能，无需任何重新训练。

Conclusion: DIME-Net展示了在多样复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能，证明了基于transformer架构的有效性

Conclusion: ViT架构在建模人脸图像效用方面具有显著效果，为未来FIQA研究提供了可扩展的基础框架

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Motivation: 视频动作检测需要密集的时空注释，这既复杂又费用昂贵。真实视频的难度各异，不同的视频根本不需要相同级别的注释，因此需要研究如何根据样本特点选择适当的注释类型来降低注释成本。

Method: 首先提出了一种简单的主动学习策略来估计每个视频所需的注释类型，然后提出了新颖的时空间3D超像素方法来从这些注释中生成伪标签进行有效训练。研究了视频级标签、点、草笼、盲框和像素级掩码等多种注释类型。

Result: 在UCF101-24和JHMDB-21数据集上验证了该方法，结果显示在性能损失最小的情况下，能够显著降低注释成本。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的方法来优化视频动作检测中的注释过程，通过为不同难度的视频选择适当的注释类型，实现了注释成本和检测性能之间的良好平衡。

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of

reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact
while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics.
Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos
generated by our simulator, as a crash-test predictor for pallet
configurations, further enhancing the system's utility in safety analysis.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过适应性视角选择策略，在线从RGB帧生成高质量3D高斯漆点模型，解决了依赖关键帧导致的场景重建不完整问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖关键帧进行3D场景估计，无法捐弄整个场景，导致重建不完整。同时在线处理限制了可使用的帧数和训练迭代次数

Method: 提出适应性视角选择策略，在线分析重建质量并选择最优非关键帧进行额外训练。结合关键帧和选择的非关键帧，从多角度精炼不完整区域。还包含在线多视角立体框架确保3D信息一致性

Result: 在复杂户外场景中表现超过现有最先进方法，实现了突出的性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能的帧选择策略有效提升了3D高斯漆点模型的完整性，为在线RGB只视角重建提供了高质量解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了Noisy Alignment方法，通过显式抑制中毒图像中的噪声成分，在自监督对比学习中实现高效的数据投毒后门攻击，达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据投毒后门攻击方法依赖脆弱的隐式共现关系，且对后门图像中判别性特征的抑制不足，导致攻击效果有限。

Method: 通过策略性地操纵对比学习的随机裁剪机制，将噪声对齐过程建模为图像布局优化问题，并使用理论推导的最优参数实现。

Result: 该方法简单有效，在保持干净数据准确性的同时，相比现有方法达到最先进的攻击性能，并对常见后门防御具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment方法通过显式噪声对齐机制，成功解决了现有数据投毒后门攻击方法的局限性，为对比学习的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语检测任务需要先理解表达再进行推理，而当前推理模型的趋势可能提升LLMs在这类逻辑任务中的表现，因此研究推理能力对习语检测的影响很有必要。

Method: 评估DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上的表现，分析思维链推理的效果，并尝试为小模型提供定义来改善性能。

Result: 推理效果比预期小：小模型通过CoT推理能从数学调优模型中提升性能但不及基础模型；大模型（14B+）有适度提升；大模型能准确理解习语含义，小模型则经常失败；为小模型提供定义在某些情况下能改善性能。

Conclusion: 模型大小对习语理解能力有显著影响，大模型展现出良好的习语理解能力，而推理能力的提升效果有限且因模型大小而异，为小模型提供外部知识可能是一种有效的改进策略。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

Motivation: 当前LLM在复杂问题求解时存在格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理效率低下的问题，需要开发能够产生完整分析轨迹、支持代码执行和自我修正的专业模型。

Method: 采用轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生144,000个标记笔记本片段；双奖励框架结合结构信号和分层奖励模型；优化GRPO算法实现KV缓存重用和顺序生成；提供双推理接口（代理模式和反思模式）。

Result: 在标准基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench准确率提升30%，每个解决方案减少18-49%的token使用。

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹式训练和优化的强化学习框架，成功解决了LLM在复杂推理任务中的常见问题，实现了高效、准确的研究生级别问题求解能力。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于母语者自由词汇联想规范的参数高效微调方法，通过监督微调(SFT)和PPO偏好优化来提升LLM的文化对齐能力，在英语和中文任务上显著提升文化表现，小模型可媲美大模型效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在跨文化沟通中存在训练语料分布偏差问题，缺乏有效的文化对齐方法，需要探索基于人类认知的文化建模方案。

Method: 使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和中文词汇联想数据，对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行监督微调(SFT)和基于PPO的偏好优化，参数高效微调方法。

Result: SFT使英语P@5提升16-20%，中文提升43-165%，具体性中位数提升+0.20，达到人类水平的情感效价和唤醒度。在世界价值观调查中答案分布向目标文化偏移，中文对齐响应翻倍，美国偏见下降三分之一。7-8B模型媲美70B基线。

Conclusion: 少量基于文化的联想数据即可实现价值对齐，无需昂贵重新训练。研究强调了基于人类认知的方法在改善AI模型文化对齐方面的潜力和必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMed是一个强化学习框架，通过Shapley信息增益奖励机制，让医疗大语言模型从被动回答转向主动提问，在信息不全的医疗场景中显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动询问能力，这在真实临床交互场景中可能导致误诊风险。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1）SIG引导的模型初始化使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量交互轨迹；2）SIG增强的策略优化结合新颖的奖励分配机制，针对信息量大的问题进行优化。

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于现有方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProMed成功实现了医疗LLM从被动到主动范式的转变，通过强化学习和信息增益量化机制显著提升了临床交互场景中的诊断性能。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

TL;DR: 使用LoRA微调了ALLaM-7B模型来支持沙特方言（哈吉赛和纳吉迪）生成，通过语言标签方法显著提升了方言控制能力和文本保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语，对沙特方言支持有限，影响了对真实方言变体的捐描能力

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集（5,466条合成指令-响应对），采用LoRA微调ALLaM-7B模型，测试了两种方案：带方言标签和不带标签的训练方式

Result: 带标签模型在方言控制方面表现最佳，将沙特方言率从47.97%提升到84.21%，并减少了标准阿语漏出，文本保真度指标也有显著提升

Conclusion: LoRA微调方法能够有效地为阿拉伯语言模型添加方言支持，带明确语言标签的方案在控制方言使用方面更有效，但研究不公开数据集和模型权重

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

TL;DR: MATA是一个用于评估大型语言模型在泰卢固语能力的新数据集，包含729个多选题和开放式问题，覆盖多个语言维度。评估了11个开源和闭源模型，分析了模型表现并发现它们依赖表面启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM评估主要关注英语等高资源语言，缺乏对泰卢固语等低资源语言的系统评估。需要细粒度评估来理解模型局限并指导开发更具语言能力的LLMs。

Method: 构建包含729个多选题和开放式问题的泰卢固语评估数据集，评估11个LLM模型，分析模型对答案位置和干扰项模式的依赖，比较LLM-as-a-judge与人工评估的可靠性。

Result: 发现LLMs在多选题中依赖表面启发式方法，在低资源语言环境中LLM-as-a-judge评估的可靠性需要进一步验证。

Conclusion: 细粒度评估对于理解模型局限性至关重要，可以为开发更具语言能力的LLMs提供信息，同时为泰卢固语NLP的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

TL;DR: 模型压缩后虽然精度相近，但解释性和检验准确性与原模型存在显著差异，不能直接作为可信赖替代


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注压缩模型的精度性能，但性能平等并不保证模型可信赖性相等，需要从解释性和检验准确性两个维度评估信任相等性

Method: 提出两维度评估框架：1）解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试）评估模型是否基于相同特征做决策；2）检验准确性相似性（使用ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图）评估模型预测概率的可靠性

Result: 对BERT-base模型及其压缩版本进行实验，发现即使精度几乎相同，压缩模型与原模型在解释性对齐和检验准确性方面存在显著差异

Conclusion: 压缩模型不具备与大模型相等的可信赖性，在部署时需要进行豫富的评估，不能仅以性能指标作为唯一判断标准

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在医疗应用中，确定性解码策略（如beam search）通常优于随机策略，模型大小和推理时间影响输出质量，医疗专用LLM在解码选择上更敏感但无整体优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索解码策略对医疗领域LLM输出质量的影响，因为医疗应用对准确性要求极高，而解码策略选择的影响尚未充分研究

Method: 在5个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话、图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用LLM不同尺寸模型

Result: 确定性策略表现更好，beam search得分最高；大模型总体得分更高但推理时间更长；医疗LLM在2个任务中表现更好但整体无优势且对解码更敏感；不同评估指标相关性因任务而异

Conclusion: 医疗应用中解码策略的选择有时比模型选择更重要，需要谨慎选择解码方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语音大语言模型是否像文本LLM一样存在性别偏见

Method: 利用说话者分配作为分析工具，构建职业和性别色彩词汇两个数据集，评估Bark TTS模型的默认说话者选择

Result: Bark模型展现出性别意识，有些性别倾向，但没有系统性偏见

Conclusion: 语音LLM在说话者选择上显示出某些性别倾向，但偏见模式不如文本LLM明显

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

TL;DR: AdaDocVQA是一个针对低资源环境下长文档视觉问答的自适应框架，通过混合文本检索、智能数据增强和自适应集成推理三大创新，在日语文档VQA基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文档视觉问答在低资源环境下面临的上下文限制和训练数据不足的问题，特别是在处理日语等低资源语言时。

Method: 采用混合文本检索架构进行文档分割，智能数据增强管道自动生成高质量推理问答对并进行多级验证，以及自适应集成推理机制。

Result: 在JDocQA基准测试中，Yes/No问题准确率达到83.04%，事实性问题52.66%，数值问题44.12%；在LAVA数据集上达到59%准确率，创下日语文档VQA的新SOTA。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源语言和专门领域提供了可扩展的基础，每个组件都有实质性贡献，在日语文档VQA任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现大型语言模型中的持久概念遗忘，通过在多个层中识别并抑制目标特征的激活来移除有害知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除不需要的知识同时保持模型效用。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时操作，无法对模型参数进行持久修改，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器自动识别多个层中的重要特征，并抑制这些特征的激活，实现参数高效的持久概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个大型语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示该方法实现了目标概念与良性概念的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数高效方法，能够实现大型语言模型中特定知识的持久移除，同时保持模型的其他能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

Motivation: 调查主要培养在英语数据上的视觉语言模型是否能处理真实世界的跨语言多模态推理任务，特别是在越南语教育评估中的表现。

Method: 提出ViExam标准化测试集，包含2,548道多模态问题，涵盖数学、物理、化学等七个学科领域。测试各种VLMs的准确率，进行跨语言提示实验和人机协作测试。

Result: 最先进VLMs仅获57.74%准确率，开源模型27.70%，都低于人类平均66.54%。只有o3模型(74.07%)超过人类平均，但远低于人类最高水平99.60%。跨语言提示反而降低性能，人机协作能提升5%。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在低资源语言的多模态教育内容上表现差强，需要针对性的多语言训练和优化才能提升性能。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用概括词（如'鸟会飞'）在非单调逻辑中具有重要地位，这些语句允许异常情况且中心于默认推理和认知程序，需要评估LLM在这些复杂推理任务上的能力。

Method: 使用28个大型语言模型进行可撤销推理模式的评测，测试了不同提示方式（零械提示、少械提示、链式提示）对性能的影响。

Result: 虽然一些前沿模型在默认推理问题上表现良好，但性能在模型间和提示方式间存在显著差异。链式提示导致了严重的性能下降（平均准确率下降11.14%）。大多数模型无法区分可撤销和演绎推理，或将通用概括词误解为普遍话语。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在默认推理方面既有望也有限，需要进一步改进模型的推理能力和对通用概括词的理解。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Motivation: 探索如何更准确地理解深度学习模型中隐含的知识，对现有词向量解释方法的偏见进行批判性分析，提高AI系统的可解释性。

Method: 通过实验证明现有方法能够成功预测甚至随机信息，使用算法上界分析来证明预测结果主要受到向量空间几何特性的制约，而非真正的语义表征。

Result: 发现预测准确性不能作为词向量含有语义知识的可靠指标，现有方法的结果主要反映了向量空间的几何特性，而非真正的语义知识编码。

Conclusion: 仅仅基于预测性能进行数据集比较是不可靠的，需要发展更有效的方法来真正识别词向量中的语义知识编码。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Motivation: 随着EEG在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，高效检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据成为一个紧迫挑战。

Method: 提出三层超图框架，将EEG领域知识、个体患者病例和大规模存储库统一为可遍历的n元关系超图，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域中常见奇恶行为（无条件封神），这种倾向在高风险科学问答场景中带来严重风险。虽然重要，但这种现象在事实问答上仍未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出统一评估框架，通过对抗性提示设置和目标指标（如误导抵抗力、奇恶抵抗力）来量化用户社会压力对模型输出的影响。还提出了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话和思维链理由上进行轻量级精调来减少奇恶行为。

Result: 对开源和专有模型的系统评估显示了普遍的奇恶倾向，这更多由对齐策略驱动而非模型大小。Pressure-Tune在具有挑战性的科学问答测试集上显著提升了奇恶抵抗力，而不伤害准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力。

Conclusion: Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的方法，能够在不影响模型准确性和响应能力的前提下，显著提升模型的奇恶抵抗力，为实现更真实和有原则的模型行为提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

*Shengchao Liu,Xiaoming Liu,Chengzhengxu Li,Zhaohan Zhang,Guoxin Ma,Yu Lan,Shuai Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MGT-Prism是一种基于频域分析的机器生成文本检测方法，通过低频滤波和动态频谱对齐实现跨域泛化，在11个测试数据集上平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测器在同域训练测试时表现良好，但在跨域场景下由于域偏移问题泛化能力差，需要开发能够有效应对不同领域变化的检测方法。

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现机器生成文本与人类撰写文本在频谱模式上存在显著差异。设计了低频域滤波模块过滤对域偏移敏感的文档级特征，以及动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和域不变特征。

Result: 在三个域泛化场景下的11个测试数据集上，MGT-Prism平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism通过频域特征处理有效提升了跨域泛化性能，为解决域偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型生成文本与儿童语言的相似性，发现LLM生成的文本更长但词汇丰富度较低，更依赖高频词，名词使用不足，语义相似度低。few-shot提示略微提高了相似性，但仍无法完全复制儿童语言模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在教育中的应用日益增多，需要了解LLM生成的文本是否真正类似于儿童语言，这对教育工具和心理语言学研究具有重要意义。

Method: 使用相同的图片故事生成两个LLM语料库（零样本和few-shot提示），通过心理语言学文本属性（词频、词汇丰富度、句子长度、词性标注、词嵌入语义相似度）进行比较分析。

Result: LLM生成的文本比儿童文本更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多使用高频词，名词代表性不足。语义向量空间分析显示相似度低。few-shot提示仅略微提高相似性。

Conclusion: LLM难以准确复制儿童语言模式，这对儿童教育工具中使用LLM生成语言的适当性提出了重要问题，为心理语言学研究和教育应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的医学摘要事实准确性担忧，通过提供句子级引用让用户能够追溯原始上下文来验证准确性

Method: 构建TracSum基准数据集，提出包含四个指标的细粒度评估框架，开发Track-Then-Sum摘要生成管道（先追踪句子再生成摘要）

Result: 实验证明TracSum可作为有效的基准，显示先进行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性，包含完整上下文能进一步提升完整性

Conclusion: TracSum基准和提出的方法能够有效支持可追溯的基于方面的摘要生成任务，提高医学摘要的可信度

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过贝叶斯方法评估了主流大语言模型在道德维度理解方面的表现，发现AI模型通常能排在前25%的人类标注者水平，误报率更低，道德检测能力更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用确定性标注作为基准，无法捕捉人类标注者的分歧和不确定性。本文旨在通过建模标注者分歧来更准确地评估语言模型的道德理解能力。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架建模标注者分歧，区分偶然不确定性和认知不确定性。评估了Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级模型，基于25万+标注和10万+文本数据。

Result: AI模型表现优于75%的人类标注者，平衡准确率远超平均水平，特别是假阴性率远低于人类，显示出更敏感的道德检测能力。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在道德维度理解方面表现出色，能够达到人类顶尖标注者的水平，且在避免漏检方面优于人类。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 通过插入计数器标记和计数规则的提示策略，使大语言模型能够准确控制生成文本的长度，无需微调或迭代金矢塔


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成文本时经常无法准确遵循长度指令，既会超过也会不足指定长度，因为模型无法可靠地进行内部词汇计数

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次策略，通过在提示中添加倒计时标记和明确的计数规则，使模型在写作过程中同时进行计数

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务中，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从累素提示下的30%以下提升到95%以上，超越了普遍使用的草稿-然后修计基线方法，同时保持了评估答案质量

Conclusion: 突出显示仅通过提示工程就可以实现精确的长度控制，为训练或解码基于方法提供了轻量级的替代方案

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Motivation: 自动评价指标在NLG预测人类判断时存在显著缺陷，无论是传统词法指标还是最新的LLM评估方法，都无法成为普适性解决方案。研究指出应根据具体任务选择指标，重视验证方法和多元评。

Method: 进行系统的文献综述和实证分析，检查现有评价指标的方法论、文档化优势与限制、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性。特别关注LLM-as-a-Judge方法和RAG任务评估。

Result: 发现现有指标往往只能抓取文本质量的某些特定方面，效果随任务和数据集而异，验证实践结构化不足，与人类判断的相关性不稳定。这些问题在最新的LLM评估方法中仍然存在。

Conclusion: 证明了寻找"完美评价指标"的不可行性，建议根据具体任务需求选择指标，采用互补性评估方案，并强调新指标开发应重点关注改进验证方法。

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge

Motivation: 现有科学领域评测基准存在三个关键问题：多语言场景下推理能力评估不足、多模态覆盖不充分、科学知识点缺乏细粒度标注，需要构建更全面的评测体系。

Method: 精心收集1019个高质量问答对，涉及3种评测模式，覆盖数学、物理、化学、生物4个学科，支持中英法西日5种语言，在16个开源模型和4个闭源模型上进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果表明MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有很大挑战性，如图像模式下o4-mini在数理化生准确率仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%、29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，通过多语言和细粒度知识属性深入分析了现有模型的性能，识别了在特定领域的弱点，为MLLMs在科学领域的发展提供了重要评测工具。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR训练在提升Pass@1性能的同时会导致策略熵下降，降低生成多样性并限制Pass@k性能

Method: 在线自我对弈与变分问题合成策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题同时保持参考答案不变

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别提升18.3%和22.8%，在12个推理基准上一致有效

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效维持训练过程中的策略熵，显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的性能上限

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Result: 实验结果显示PING在网页导航和代码生成任务中一致超过现有提示方法，显著提升了安全性而不搁欠性能。隐藏状态分析显示前缀token对行为修改至关重要。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单有效的方法，能够在不搁欠代理性能的前提下显著提升细调后LLM代理的安全性，解决了代理细调过程中的安全风险问题。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Abstract: The interaction of an object with an unsteady flow is non-trivial and is
still far from being fully understood. When an airfoil or hydrofoil, for
example, undergoes time-dependent motion, nonlinear flow phenomena such as
dynamic stall can emerge. The present work experimentally investigates the
interaction between a hydrofoil and surface gravity waves. The waves impose
periodic fluctuations of the velocity magnitude and orientation, causing a
steadily translating hydrofoil to be susceptible to dynamic stall at large wave
forcing amplitudes. Simultaneous measurement of both the forces acting on the
hydrofoil and the flow around it by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV)
are performed, to properly characterise the hydrofoil-wave interaction. In an
attempt at alleviating the impact of the flow unsteadiness via passive flow
control, a bio-inspired tubercle geometry is applied along the hydrofoil
leading edge. This geometry is known to delay stall in steady cases but has
scarcely been studied in unsteady flow conditions. The vortex structures
associated with dynamic stall are identified, and their trajectories,
dimension, and strength characterised. This analysis is performed for both
straight- and tubercled-leading-edge geometries, with tubercles found to
qualitatively modify the flow behaviour during dynamic stall. Contrary to
previous studies, direct measurements of lift do not evidence any strong
modification by tubercles. Drag-driven horizontal force fluctuations, however,
which have not previously been measured in this context, are found to be
strongly attenuated. This decrease is quantified, and a physical model based on
the flow observations is finally proposed.

Abstract: The fluid dynamics community has increasingly adopted machine learning to
analyze, model, predict, and control a wide range of flows. These methods offer
powerful computational capabilities for regression, compression, and
optimization. In some cases, machine learning has even outperformed traditional
approaches. However, many fluid mechanics problems remain beyond the reach of
current machine learning techniques. As the field moves from its current state
toward a more mature paradigm, this article offers a critical assessment of the
key challenges that must be addressed. Tackling these technical issues will not
only deepen our understanding of flow physics but also expand the applicability
of machine learning beyond fundamental research. We also highlight the
importance of community-maintained datasets and open-source code repositories
to accelerate progress in this area. Furthermore, the future success of machine
learning in fluid dynamics will depend on effective training -- not only for
the next generation of researchers but also for established fluid mechanicians
adapting to this evolving landscape. Data-driven fluid dynamics is in its
critical transitional state over the next few years to shape its future. This
perspective article aims to spark discussions and encourage collaborative
efforts to advance the integration of machine learning in fluid dynamics.

Abstract: By numerical simulation of exact equations of motion (in terms of conformal
variables) for planar non-stationary potential flows of an ideal fluid with a
free surface over a strongly non-uniform bottom profile, the effect of
nonlinear compression of a long wavepacket during its Bragg reflection from
domain of gradually increasing, periodically placed barriers has been detected.
In this case, a short and tall packet of standing waves with sharp crests is
formed, and then it is transformed into the backward wave. It is essential that
with variation of frequency of the incident wave, the effect is absent in the
middle of the barrier-induced spectral gap, but it is quite prominent closely
to the upper edge of the gap, when the forward wave penetrates deeply into the
scattering domain and there, together with emerged backward wave, they form a
semblance of Bragg soliton for some time interval.

Abstract: The influence of turbine-turbine interactions on sound propagation is
investigated using numerical simulations. Three configurations are examined:
turbines aligned downstream of each other, placed side by side, and arranged in
a staggered pattern. The simulation framework combines large-eddy simulations
for aerodynamic interactions, an aeroacoustic source model to simulate turbine
sound emission, and parabolic equation methods for sound propagation. When a
second turbine is positioned directly downstream, wake-induced flow focusing
enhances sound pressure levels (SPL) and amplitude modulation (AM) by several
decibels downwind. In side-by-side and staggered configurations, SPL increases
are limited (<2 dBA), and AM is generally reduced due to spatial averaging.
Distinct AM patterns emerge in regions where acoustic contributions from both
turbines are comparable. For nearly identical rotor speeds, AM is strongly
affected by the angular offset between rotors. When rotor speeds differ
slightly, beating effects occur, resulting in intermittent AM. These findings
highlight the sensitivity of AM to rotor dynamics, a key factor influencing
sound perception, with implications for environmental impact and turbine
siting.

Conclusion: 无滑移边界和非对称外力关键地控制着限制二维激洛中大规模结构的动力学，需要修订均匀系统的缩放律，新提出的缩放关系能够统一描述不同气洛和外力条件下的边界层特性。

Abstract: We study two-dimensional turbulence in a square no-slip domain without bottom
drag using direct numerical simulations. The dynamics are shown to depend
strongly on the torque $M$ of the external forcing. When $M$ is relatively
large, a long-lived coherent vortex forms at the domain center, establishing a
persistent angular momentum. At lower torques, the angular momentum undergoes
random sign reversals due to spontaneous switching of the central vortex
circulation, though it predominantly aligns with the torque direction. We
investigate the transition between these regimes by smoothly varying $M$,
observing that the time-averaged angular momentum of the system follows
$\langle \mathcal{L} \rangle \propto M^{1/3}$. A significant part of the energy
dissipates near the domain boundaries, requiring a revision of scaling laws for
homogeneous systems. New scaling relations are proposed and they enable
velocity profiles in the boundary layers to collapse onto a universal curve for
simulations with varying fluid viscosities and forcing amplitudes. The velocity
profiles feature a linear viscous sublayer followed by a short logarithmic
region. The boundary layer thickness $\delta$ scales with the large-scale
Reynolds number $Re$ as $\delta \sim L \cdot Re^{-1/2}$, indicating that the
friction at no-slip walls is not sufficient to halt the inverse energy cascade
before it reaches the system size $L$. The results highlight how no-slip
boundaries and forcing asymmetry govern the dynamics of large-scale coherent
structures in confined two-dimensional turbulence.

Abstract: Capturing the intricate multiscale features of turbulent flows remains a
fundamental challenge due to the limited resolution of experimental data and
the computational cost of high-fidelity simulations. In many practical
scenarios only coarse representations of the flows are feasible, leaving
crucial fine-scale dynamics unresolved. This study addresses that limitation by
leveraging generative models to perform super-resolution of velocity fields and
reconstruct the unresolved scales from low-resolution conditionals. In
particular, the recently formalized stochastic interpolants are employed to
super-resolve a case study of two-dimensional turbulence. Key to our approach
is the iterative application of stochastic interpolants over local patches of
the flow field, that enables efficient reconstruction without the need to
process the full domain simultaneously. The patch-wise strategy is shown to
yield physically consistent super-resolved flow snapshots, and key statistical
quantities -- such as the kinetic energy spectrum and the spatially averaged
dissipation rate -- are accurately recovered. Moreover, compared with
full-field reconstruction, the patch-wise approach produces higher-quality
super-resolutions, and, in general, stochastic interpolants are observed to
outperform contesting generative models across a range of metrics. These
results establish stochastic interpolants as a viable tool for super-resolving
turbulent flows and highlight their potential for future applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in computational fluid dynamics to
assess the reliability and robustness of simulations, given the uncertainties
in input parameters. OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library
designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on
high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB
for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To
this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on
generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework
is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical
metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including
two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional
uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected
convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust
statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances
the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework
for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.

Conclusion: 湍流中涡结构的环量特性与其空间分布的短距离性质存在内在联系，GMC理论为理解这一现象提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Thin vortex tubes, with core sizes within the dissipation range, profuse in a
homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. Their intersections with an arbitrary
plane define, as a mathematical construct, a dilute gas of localized,
intermittently distributed, two-dimensional vortex spots. While their planar
density fluctuations are described by a field-theoretical extension of
log-normal single-point statistics, known as Gaussian multiplicative chaos
(GMC), they carry circulations which are Gaussian-correlated throughout the
inertial range. It is puzzling, then, to find that the circulations of
individual vortices are fat-tailed distributed, an apparent paradox that we fix
within the GMC framework. The solution, validated through the examination of
direct numerical simulation data for a broad range of Reynolds numbers,
unveils, as a surprising phenomenological result, an existing coupling between
the circulation of vortex structures and the short-distance properties of their
spatial distribution fluctuations at sub-Taylor microscales.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在上下文管理方面存在根本性限制，尽管上下文窗口已扩展到数百万token，但被动检索系统无法捕捉人类记忆管理的动态任务驱动特性，缺乏元认知意识和主动规划能力。

Method: 基于Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智论和Hutchins分布式认知框架，提出三个核心创新：(1)主动记忆管理与刻意信息策展；(2)支持持久工作状态的层次化认知缓冲区；(3)动态适应认知需求的任务驱动上下文优化。

Result: 实证验证显示Cognitive Workspace平均记忆重用率达到58.6%（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著性p < 0.001，Cohen's d > 23，在多个任务类型中均表现出优势。

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据，建立了综合50+最新论文的理论框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

### [132] [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
*Ziwen Han,Meher Mankikar,Julian Michael,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文发现了一种新的评估污染问题——搜索时污染（STC），即搜索型LLM智能体在回答查询时通过在线搜索获取到包含测试问题及答案的数据集，导致直接复制答案而非真正推理，损害基准测试的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着搜索型LLM智能体的广泛应用，评估这些智能体时存在数据污染风险。传统的数据污染指评估数据泄露到训练数据中，而STC是在搜索过程中实时发生的污染，需要被识别和解决。

Method: 通过在三个常用能力基准（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上测试搜索型智能体，分析其搜索日志，发现HuggingFace等平台上的公开评估数据集被检索到，导致智能体直接获取答案。通过阻断HuggingFace进行对比实验，并开展消融实验验证其他可能的污染源。

Result: 约3%的问题中，搜索型智能体直接从HuggingFace找到包含标准答案的数据集；阻断HuggingFace后，受污染子集的准确率下降约15%；公开可访问的评估数据集并非STC的唯一来源。

Conclusion: 提出了基准设计和结果报告的最佳实践建议，以解决这种新型泄漏问题，确保搜索型LLM智能体的可信评估，并公开了完整的实验日志以供审计。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，并引入轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算成本的同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型处理更大规模的语言、视觉和视频输入，token级别的计算成本成为关键瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的，或不兼容自回归生成。

Method: 基于注意力范数幅度动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器确定token数量，引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算-准确性权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量的同时匹配甚至超过学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成，有效解决了大规模生成模型的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Motivation: 研究人工智能与人类在战略决策中的差异，了解AI如何管理即时机会与长期目标的缺矩

Method: 通过网络基于的棋子互动指标来定量化棋局中的战略张力，比较人类vs人类和AIvsAI游戏的动态

Result: 竞争力强的AI能在更长时间内维持更高的战略张力，而人类玩家则限制张力和游戏复杂性；人类专业水平在1600和2300Elo附近出现突变

Conclusion: AI和人类在战略决策上采用不同方式，AI能容忍长期放置攻防平衡的复杂局面，而人类反映了认知限制和适应性策略，这对复杂战略环境中的AI应用有重要意义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Motivation: 现有基于记忆的个性化方法主要关注偏好对齐和简单问答，但现实世界中复杂任务需要对大量用户信息进行多跳推理，这对当前记忆方法提出了重大挑战。

Method: 明确定义了多跳个性化推理任务，构建了数据集和统一评估框架，实现了各种显式和隐式记忆方法，并提出了结合两种范式的HybridMem混合方法。

Result: 通过综合实验从多个角度评估了不同方法的性能，分析了它们的优缺点，并通过大量实验证明了所提出模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决个性化信息的多跳推理问题提供了新的任务定义、数据集和评估框架，提出的HybridMem方法有效解决了现有记忆方法的局限性，为研究社区提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和智能体设计可广泛应用于不同材料领域，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents框架通过多模态设计、动态计划精炼、多工具集成和多学科协作，有效解决了传统AI在心血疾病诊断中的四大问题，为临床应用提供了更加适应性和个性化的AI诊断支持。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt框架通过前瞻性和后顾性提示策略，显著提升了基于LLM的自动启发式设计性能，实现了更快的收敛速度和更好的启发式质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法存在静态操作符和缺乏知识积累机制的问题，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种协同提示策略：前瞻性提示基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后顾性提示从过去世代的成功启发式中提炼可重用的设计原则，构建持久知识库。

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于最先进的基于LLM的AHD方法，生成更高质量的启发式，同时实现更快的收敛速度和更优的查询效率。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt通过前瞻性和后顾性提示的双重机制，成功将瞬时发现转化为持久知识，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP是一个新颖的神经符号规划框架，通过神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话来解决复杂规划问题，在标准基准测试中达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经规划方法在复杂领域中存在缺失前提条件、目标不一致和幻觉问题，而经典规划器缺乏灵活性和自然语言理解能力。现有神经符号方法采用一次性翻译方式，未能充分利用神经和符号组件的协同优势。

Method: LOOP将规划视为神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话过程，集成了13个协调的神经特征，包括图神经网络处理空间关系、多智能体验证确保共识正确性、分层分解管理复杂任务，以及从成功和失败中学习的因果记忆。

Result: 在六个标准IPC基准领域评估中，LOOP达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于LLM+P（55.0%）、LLM-as-Planner（19.2%）和Tree-of-Thoughts（3.3%）等方法。

Conclusion: 可靠规划的关键不在于选择神经网络还是符号推理器，而在于让它们在整过程中真正"对话"。LOOP为构建可信赖的自主系统提供了全面蓝图，能够处理关键现实世界应用。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态输入嵌入到统一语义空间，提升跨模态泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态PEFT方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽视了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化

Method: 采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关实例在空间中收敛，支持无缝集成额外模态（如音频）而无需改变核心架构

Result: 在视觉语言和视听基准测试中展现出竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习嵌入空间中保持高语义一致性

Conclusion: 相比仅仅调适适配器权重，对齐嵌入空间结构对于可扩展的多模态学习更为重要

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理金融文档中高度非结构化、多页、异构的表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐实现比现有方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界金融文档中的财务信息通常埋藏在混乱、多页、碎片化的表格中，99.4%的表格没有边界框，最大行数达426行，需要专门的方法来处理这种独特挑战。

Method: 开发了TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行任务，然后通过推荐代理审查输出、推荐模式修订并决定最终建议，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER比Table Transformer等现有表格检测模型性能提升10.1%，大批量处理使可操作的模式建议增加104.3%，提取的持仓量增加9.8%。创建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7310亿美元持仓的真实金融表格数据集TASERTab。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面具有巨大潜力，持续学习过程对于处理复杂金融文档至关重要。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Conclusion: 这是向能够通过实际实验测试假设的体现式AI进取的一步，能够自主探索人类认知和资源限制无法浅到的科学领域，同时也提出了关于科学理解本质和科学豪赏归属的重要问题

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的模型在处理时空交通预测时面临时间编码僵化和时空融合能力弱的问题，需要更好的解决方案来处理复杂的时间模式、动态空间结构和多样输入格式。

Method: 提出STPFormer模型，包含四个核心模块：时间位置聚合器（TPA）用于模式感知时间编码，空间序列聚合器（SSA）用于序列空间学习，时空图匹配（STGM）用于跨域对齐，以及注意力混合器用于多尺度融合。

Conclusion: STPFormer通过创新的时空模式感知机制和模块化设计，成功解决了现有Transformer模型在时空交通预测中的局限性，为复杂时空数据建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world
datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation
and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

Motivation: 为了求解具有最坏情况性能要求的离散优化问题，需要一个通用的数学框架和高效解法算法

Method: 定义DMMV数学问题，分析其性质，开发GPU加速的吧吧算法，并在语言模型量化、离散断层成像和FIR滤波器设计三个应用场景中验证

Result: 在量化中平均提升14%，在断层成像中减少16%重建误差且GPU速度提升6倍，在FIR滤波器设计中浮动减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为一个通用优化问题框架具有广泛的应用前景，开源的GPU加速算法将促进该领域的进一步研究

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理在安全关键场景中存在严重风险，需要系统评估其风险意识与安全执行能力之间的差距。

Method: 开发了包含三个维度的综合评估框架：风险知识、风险识别能力和风险规避行为，并基于观察到的差距构建了包含抽象器和风险验证器的系统。

Result: 发现代理在风险知识方面表现优异（>98%通过率），但在实际风险识别中性能下降23%，执行风险行为的通过率低于26%。风险验证器系统将风险执行降低了55.3%。

Conclusion: 单纯扩展模型能力或推理计算无法解决安全问题，需要专门的安全机制设计，提出的风险验证器系统能有效减少风险行为执行。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo解决了Crafter环境缺乏基础模型支持的问题，使其成为Minecraft-like的轻量级、原型友好的通用具身智能体研究测试平台

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗文本理解方面表现出色，但在基于EHR的预测任务中表现不佳，现有混合方法无法提升LLM的内在推理能力

Method: 两阶段训练：1）使用专家指导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量逐步推理轨迹初始化策略；2）通过强化学习将LLM注意力与专家模型识别的临床显著特征对齐

Result: 在两个真实EHR数据集上平均提升14.62%的推理能力，增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见临床领域的泛化能力

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，有效提升了LLM的EHR推理内在能力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)在图表转代码生成任务中的应用，突破了监督细调的性能平台，通过多级别奖励机制显著提升了结构化输出的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在视觉-语言模型中有效，但在需要深度理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表转代码生成作为一个具体挑战，需要复杂的视觉理解和结构化输出，单纯监督细调效果有限，因此需要有效的强化学习策略来奖励结构化输出。

Method: 提出多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，构建了最大的训练语料库(包含300万个图表-代码对)，使用多级别结构化奖励系统：文本级别通过规则基础奖励验证细粒度代码细节，视觉级别通过模型基础奖励渲染生成代码为图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性，采用两阶段课程学习保证训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL方法显著突破了SFT的性能平台，在ChartMimic和ReachQA测试集上分别提升了6.2%和9.9%的高级指标，达到了与充分发展的闭源模型相竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了多模态结构化强化学习在复杂的视觉-语言任务中的有效性，通过结构化奖励机制可以显著提升模型在需要深度理解和精确输出的任务上的表现，为类似任务提供了有价值的方法论指导。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法依赖边界框或中心点回归，忽视了空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构，存在注意力漂移和点击不精确的问题。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 抑制注意力机制减少背景区域干扰；2) 基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热图建模，权重从中心向边缘递减，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试中分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能，消融实验验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: V2P方法能有效隔离目标区域并让模型专注于UI元素的最关键点，在精确GUI定位任务中具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Conclusion: NQR为解决知识图谱查询中的软约束问题提供了有效方案，通过交互式学习实现了查询答案的精细化调整

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Motivation: LIME方法在数据稀缺环境下存在随机性问题，可能产生不真实的变体和偏离真实数据流形的样本，导致代理模型无法准确近似原始模型的复杂决策边界。

Conclusion: ITL-LIME通过实例迁移学习有效解决了LIME在数据稀缺情况下的局部性和不稳定性问题，为可解释人工智能提供了更可靠的解释方法。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a
crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and
has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various
techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We
have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related
to this survey: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-with-NeSy.

TL;DR: DeepLog是一个神经符号AI的理论和操作框架，提供构建块和原语来抽象表示神经符号AI中的常用表示和计算机制，支持多种神经符号系统的表示和模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决神经符号AI领域缺乏统一框架的问题，提供一个能够抽象表示多种神经符号系统、支持不同逻辑类型和计算方式的通用框架。

Method: DeepLog包含两个关键组件：1) DeepLog语言 - 基于带注释的神经扩展的接地一阶逻辑，用于指定神经符号模型和推理任务；2) 计算层面的扩展代数电路作为计算图。这两个组件共同构成神经符号抽象机器。

Result: DeepLog在软件中实现，利用GPU实现代数电路的最新见解，通过实验比较证明了其通用性和效率，包括不同模糊和概率逻辑的比较、逻辑在架构或损失函数中使用的比较，以及CPU与GPU实现的性能比较。

Conclusion: DeepLog提供了一个声明式的神经符号抽象机器，通过选择不同的代数结构和逻辑可以轻松获得不同的神经符号模型，为神经符号AI研究提供了统一的理论和操作框架。

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

### [157] [CausalPlan: Empowering Efficient LLM Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Causality-Driven Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13721)
*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过整合显式结构因果推理来改进LLM代理在协作任务中的规划能力，减少无效动作并提高协作性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理（尤其是较小的开源模型）在协作任务中经常产生因果无效或不连贯的动作，因为它们依赖表面相关性而非基于因果推理，这限制了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划能力。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，包含结构因果动作（SCA）模型，从代理轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前动作和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策。该结构用于指导动作选择，通过为LLM生成的动作提案分配因果分数、重新加权，或在需要时回退到因果基础的替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试的五个多代理协调任务和四个不同大小的LLM（Gemma-7B、Llama-8B、Qwen-14B、Llama-70B）上评估，CausalPlan持续减少无效动作，在AI-AI和人类-AI设置中改善协作，优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多代理LLM系统的价值，通过将因果知识直接嵌入决策循环来约束规划到干预一致的行为，而无需微调LLM本身。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: 提出了EMRC框架，通过专家感知的多LLM协作来提升医疗决策的准确性和可靠性，包括动态选择最优LLM和置信度融合验证机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一LLM方法受限于参数知识和静态训练数据，无法有效整合复杂的临床信息，需要多LLM协作来提升医疗决策质量

Method: 两阶段框架：1）基于公开语料构建LLM专业能力表进行专家感知的代理招募；2）通过置信度融合和对抗验证实现多代理协作

Result: 在三个公开MDM数据集上优于最先进的单LLM和多LLM方法，在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的代理招募策略和代理互补性，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策系统的性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的量化公式实例化技术在SMT求解中存在限制，需要一种能够动态学习并综合各种方法优势的新方法

Method: 将观察到的实例化视为潜在语言的样本，使用概率上下文无文法文法生成类似的新项，可选性地通过反转学习到的项概率来探索多样性

Result: 方法能够模仿成功的历史实例化，同时保持对新解的探索能力

Conclusion: 这种基于概率文法的动态学习方法为量词推理提供了利用与探索的平衡机制，有力提升SMT求解器的性能

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Motivation: 当前单一RAG框架无法良好适应广泛的下游任务，需要利用多个RAG系统的优势来提升性能。

Method: 从理论和机制两个层面分析RAG集成框架：理论上从信息瑜角度解释，机制上从流程级和模块级探索，选择四种流程（分支、迭代、循环、代理）和三种模块（生成器、检索器、重排器）。

Result: 实验结果显示，无论在流程级还是模块级，聚合多个RAG系统都具有良好的通用性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 本研究为多RAG系统集成相关研究奠定了基础，证明了集成方法在提升RAG系统性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Result: 在17个基准领域中显著提高了广义计划质量，其中12个领域的最佳程序能解决所有可生成的任务

Conclusion: 通过伪代码调试、反思和多程序选择的综合方法可以有效提升LLM生成广义计划的成功率和质量

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过模块化智能体框架实现了金融时间序列建模工作流的自动化和增强，支持自适应学习、鲁棒调试和透明审计，满足金融服务等高风险环境的关键需求。

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协作AI代理的新兴行为特征，为设计稳定有效的AI驱动业务分析系统提供了蓝图。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop

tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态情感分析方法，通过结合CNN图像分析和LLM文本处理，在自然灾害情境下实现更准确的社交媒体情感分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然灾害期间，准确理解公众情感对灾难管理至关重要。传统方法分离处理文本和图像模态，无法有效抓取多模态间的复杂关系

Method: 使用CNN进行图像分析和LLM（GPT）进行文本处理，通过提示工程提取情感特征。重点是上下文注意力机制模型多模态关系，提高模型对文本和视觉数据关系的理解能力

Result: 在CrisisMMD数据集上，模型达到了准确率2.43%和F1分数5.18%的显著提升，在各种自然灾害情况下都能更准确地将社交媒体数据分类为信息性和非信息性

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了物理信息神经网络中训练点分布对微分方程求解精度的影响，比较了五种训练数据生成策略，包括新提出的基于正弦的训练点分布方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络在求解微分方程方面展现出巨大潜力，但其性能受多种因素影响，其中训练点分布作为核心组件尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 使用两个常微分方程和两个偏微分方程，测试五种训练数据生成策略（包括新提出的基于正弦的训练点分布），采用浅层网络架构（1-2个隐藏层），并考虑随机和固定种子权重初始化以确保可重复性。

Result: 研究结果显示训练点分布对解精度有显著影响，且这种影响与微分方程的特性相关。基于正弦的训练点分布方法表现出良好的性能。

Conclusion: 训练点分布是影响物理信息神经网络性能的关键因素，需要根据具体微分方程特性进行优化选择，基于正弦的分布策略是一种有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

TL;DR: 提出了DGNPP模型，结合图神经网络和点过程来学习时序交互网络，同时捕捉网络拓扑结构和时间动态性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时序交互网络学习忽略了网络拓扑结构的影响，将其视为粗粒度的多序列预测问题

Method: DGNPP包含节点聚合层（捕捉拓扑结构生成静态表示）和自注意力层（动态更新嵌入），将动态和静态嵌入结合到事件强度函数中，通过最大似然估计优化

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，DGNPP在事件预测和时间预测任务上表现优异，效率高，显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: DGNPP有效解决了先前方法的局限性，成功整合了网络拓扑结构和时间动态信息

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

TL;DR: RISE是一个两阶段框架，通过强化学习生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链，然后利用高质量CoT进行监督微调和强化微调，提升VLM在复杂图像标注任务中的推理能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务中表现不佳，标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证的思维链而产生不一致的推理。

Method: RISE框架包含两个阶段：1) Reason阶段(RISE-CoT)：使用强化学习的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链；2) Inspire和Strengthen阶段(RISE-R1)：利用RISE-CoT奖励筛选的高质量CoT子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调。

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型超越了标准SFT和Visual-RFT方法，实现了更强的性能和更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一种无需人工标注思维链的自监督解决方案，能够有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Result: 该方法结合堆叠回归算法和相对度条件，能够发现并反馈线性化物理模型的真实控制方程

Conclusion: 本文提出的新颖方法相比现有工作，在系统识别和反馈线性化方面具有显著优势

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Motivation: 传感器基于人体活动识别(HAR)领域高质量标签数据稀缺，而传统的信号变换数据增废(STDA)方法存在物理不可行的问题，导致增废数据无法保持原始活动标签的意义。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上评测，PPDA方法比STDA方法平均提升宏观F1分数3.7个百分点(最高达13个百分点)，并能在训练主体数量减少60%的情况下达到竞争性能效果。

Conclusion: 物理可行数据增废在HAR中具有显著优势，物理模拟为生成合成IMU数据提供了成本效益高的可扩展方案，有助于解决HAR领域的标注数据稀缺挑战。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

Conclusion: HCC成功将类别层次结构整合到保形预测中，在保持理论保证的同时提供了更具语义意义的预测集

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种约束流匹配方法：对于可微距离约束的直接惩罚方法，以及对于仅能通过成员查询的约束的随机化学习方法，通过两阶段训练提高计算效率，在保持目标分布的同时显著提升约束满足率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的流匹配生成方法缺乏对复杂约束的处理能力，特别是当约束只能通过查询成员关系（如黑盒分类器）而不能提供可微函数时，需要新的约束生成框架。

Method: 提出两种方法：(a) 对于可微距离约束，在FM目标中加入约束惩罚项；(b) 对于成员查询约束，使用随机化学习均值流，并采用两阶段训练策略提高效率。

Result: 在多个合成约束生成任务中，所提方法在保持目标分布的同时显著提高了约束满足率，并成功应用于基于硬标签黑盒分类器的对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂约束下的流匹配生成提供了有效解决方案，特别是在只能通过查询访问约束的场景下，开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的fMRI分类方法主要基于静态功能连通性，无法全面抓取空间时间关系，因此需要新方法来更好地理解脑部活动动态。

Method: 使用基于transformer的注意力机制动态推断脑功能连通性，构建时变图并通过图卷积网络(GCN)和transformer进行处理，抓取局部交互和全局时间依赖关系。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集子集上达到了63.2%的准确率和60.0%的AUC，显著超过静态图方法(GCN:51.8%)。

Conclusion: 证明了联合建模动态连通性和空间时间上下文对fMRI分类的效果，核心创新点在于注意力驱动的动态图创建和通过GCN-transformer融合的层次空间时间特征融合。

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Conclusion: X-MoE系统显著提升了MoE架构在非NVIDIA平台上的训练效率和可扩展性，为下一代MoE模型的大规模训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Method: 提取每批数据的低秩特征表示，应用Fast MaxVol采样器选择跨越批次主导子集的小型多样化子集，并使用梯度近似准则动态调整子集大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GRAFT在准确性和效率方面匹配或超过了最近的基线方法，在准确性、效率和排放之间提供了有利的权衡。

Conclusion: GRAFT通过低秩子空间操作和精心选择的训练样本，有效减少了训练时间、能耗和碳排放，同时保持了训练性能。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种可微分的量化方法，通过学习比特宽度、噪声缩放和限定边界来解决量化瓶颈问题，在极端低比特宽度下仍能保持竞争性的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络会导致信道容量下降，特别是在比特宽度较低时，四舍五入操作会造成瓶颈效应，影响模型性能。需要一种能够在极端量化设置下保持高准确性的方法。

Method: 采用全可微分的直通估计器(STE)，其中比特宽度、噪声缩放和限定边界都是可学习的参数。通过外点罚法来强制目标比特宽度，并使用软化的评估指标（通过短米技术）来稳定训练过程。

Result: 该方法在极端的W1A1（1比特激活函数和1比特权重）设置下仍能达到竞争性的准确性，同时保留了STE方法的高效性。

Conclusion: 这种简单但有效的方法能够成功解决量化神经网络中的瓶颈问题，实现了在极低比特宽度下的高准确性，为高效量化提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: J3O框架能够在资源受限的边缘环境中高效地支持多任务推理，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 通过时间-频率分析鸟鸣事件识别统计异常通道，使用LOF算法和空间相关指标来评估与临床粮病发作起源区的空间一致性，在手术成功病人中显示高准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种量化框架来评估鸟鸣事件分析识别的异常通道与临床定义的粮病发作起源区之间的空间一致性，以提供粮病定位的补充方法。

Method: 采用两步方法：(1)无监督异常检测，使用局部异常因子(LOF)算法识别鸟鸣事件的谱时特征异常通道；(2)空间相关分析，计算精确匹配指标和加权指数相似性，包含半球一致性和电极近距离因素。

Result: LOF方法(N=20, contamination=0.2)有效检测异常通道。指数匹配(加权通道近距离)在SOZ定位中表现更优。无粮病病人(Index Precision均值: 0.903)和手术成功病人(0.865)表现最佳，而失败案例一致性较低(0.460)。

Conclusion: 鸟鸣基础的异常检测结合加权空间指标，为SOZ定位提供了补充方法，尤其在手术成功病人中显示出良好效果。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学空间极其庞大（10^23到10^60个可合成候选分子），需要高效探索方法。虽然已有多种深度生成模型用于小分子设计，但基于字符串表示的分子大语言模型(Mol-LLMs)作为可扩展方法能够探索数十亿分子，但标准语言建模实践对分子生成性能的影响尚不清楚。

Conclusion: NovoMolGen为推进高效有效的分子建模策略提供了坚实基础，系统研究为分子大语言模型的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Result: 算法通信成本较低，只需共享同质特征的计算摘要，学习复杂度从O(N)降至O(√N)，在仿真定价环境中显示优势

Conclusion: 网络化上下文手势问题通过适应性信息共享可以在降低通信成本的同时提高学习效果，两种算法具有互补性能

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: MAVIS是一个轻量级的推理时对齐框架，通过价值引导的搜索实现多目标对齐，无需修改基础模型权重即可动态控制LLM行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每个目标或偏好配置微调模型，计算成本高且不灵活，需要一种轻量级的推理时对齐方案

Method: 训练一组小型价值模型对应不同目标，推理时根据用户指定权重组合这些模型生成倾斜函数来调整基础模型的输出分布

Result: MAVIS在性能上优于为每个目标微调模型并事后组合的基线方法，甚至接近为用户的精确偏好微调模型的理想化设置性能

Conclusion: MAVIS提供了一个计算高效且灵活的多目标对齐框架，能够在推理时动态调整LLM行为而不需要修改基础模型

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Method: 提出EventTSF自回归生成框架，使用流匹配自回归滑散捕捉细微的时间-事件交互，根据事件语义信号自适应控制流匹配时间步，采用多模态U形滑散变换器高效融合不同分辨率的时间和文本模态

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上超过12个基线方法，在多样化事件感知非稳态时间序列预测场景中实现了10.7%更高预测准确性和1.13倍更快训练效率

Conclusion: EventTSF有效解决了多模态时间序列预测中的精细同步、时间不确定性和多分辨率对齐挑战，为整合文本事件信息的非稳态时间序列预测提供了有效框架

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

Conclusion: SVDformer为有向图上的表示学习建立了新范式，能够显式保持特征传播过程中的边方向性。

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

Method: 提出ASAP方法，通过计算当前和先前softmax输出的余弦距离，将其映射到有界范围内来自动调整学习率，无需标签、模型集成或历史输入

Result: 在多个数据集和偏移场景下的实验表明，ASAP能持续提升准确率和效率

Conclusion: ASAP为无监督模型自适应提供了一种实用有效的解决方案

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

Conclusion: HCAL分类器通过语义一致性建模和自适应优化策略，有效解决了HMC中的结构一致性和多任务平衡问题，为层次分类任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyMixOp是一种新颖的神经算子框架，通过惯性流形理论和局部-全局混合变换，将无限维非线性PDE动力学转换为有限维潜在空间，有效解决了传统方法在处理非线性动力学时的挑战。


<details>

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习算法的不透明性问题，这是人工智能道德发展的主要障碍。需要明确不同类型不透明性的性质和产生原因，以及其各自的仪伯影响。

Method: 采用理论分析方法，首先区分两种不透明性：技术复杂性导致的认知不可访问性，以及商业保密导致的意图性隐藏。然后评估解释性AI技术的效果和局限性。

Result: 识别了两种根本不同的不透明性源头，且发现解释性AI技术仍面临重重挑战，无法完全解决算法的黑盒问题。

Conclusion: 算法不透明性是一个多维度问题，需要针对不同类型采取不同的解决方案。技术性不透明需要更好的解释方法，而商业性不透明则需要法律和道德规范来平衡利益。

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电网中渗透率增加，需要建筑群协调需求灵活性。现有测试平台主要针对单栋建筑，多建筑平台有限且通常依赖简化模型，无法充分捕捉物理细节和中间变量，限制了控制策略的基准测试能力。

Method: 开发MuFlex开源平台，支持EnergyPlus建筑模型的同步信息交换，遵循最新OpenAI Gym接口，提供模块化、标准化的强化学习实现。使用Soft Actor-Critic算法进行案例研究。

Result: 案例研究表明，聚合四栋办公楼的灵活性能够将总峰值需求降低到指定阈值以下，同时保持室内环境质量。

Conclusion: MuFlex平台为多建筑灵活性协调控制提供了有效的基准测试工具，证明了建筑群聚合在需求响应中的潜力。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA是医院和长期护理机构中的重大公共卫生威胁，现有预测模型缺乏流行病学可解释性且性能有限，机制性流行病模型难以校准且难以整合多样化数据集。

Method: 整合神经网络与机制性元种群模型，利用患者级保险索赔数据、通勤数据和医疗转移模式，学习区域和时间特定的MRSA传播参数。

Result: CALYPSO在州级预测性能上比机器学习基线提高了4.5%以上，能够识别高风险区域和制定感染预防资源分配的成本效益策略。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在多个空间分辨率上进行准确、可解释的预测，并支持感染控制政策和爆发风险的反事实分析。

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

### [202] [Collapsing ROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13552)
*Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的风险预测方法CROC，能够合并处理常见和稀有变异，提高了疾病风险预测的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基因风险预测模型主要基于常见变异，预测准确性不足以满足临床需求，需要综合考虑常见和稀有变异来提高预测性能

Method: 提出了折叠受调者工作特征方法（CROC），是之前前向ROC（FROC）方法的扩展，特别添加了处理稀有变异的流程

Result: 使用533个SNPs和37个候选基因进行评估，发现综合所有SNPs的模型（AUC=0.605）比仅使用常见变异的模型（AUC=0.585）更准确。当常见变异数量减少时，CROC方法表现更优，在仅有稀有变异的情况下，CROC达到AUC=0.603，而FROC仅有AUC=0.524

Conclusion: CROC方法能够有效处理稀有变异并提高风险预测的准确性，为综合利用常见和稀有变异进行疾病预测提供了有效方法

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Conclusion: GenHAI模型为医院管理者提供了强大的工具来回答关于MRSA感染风险的关键问题，有助于制定有效的防控策略

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法虽然在下游任务中表现出色，但缺乏统一的理论框架。作者希望建立一个通用框架来统一这些方法，并解决无标签情况下如何保持特征空间的类信息这一挑战。

Method: 提出了通用学习框架(GLF)，包含对齐部分和约束部分。针对无标签情况下难以设计约束部分的问题，提出了自适应分布校准(ADC)方法，通过迭代捕捉样本间的动态关系来确保类内紧凑性和类间可分性。

Result: 理论分析和实验评估都证明了ADC方法的优越性。该方法能够有效地在特征空间中保持原始输入空间中的样本距离关系。

Conclusion: GLF框架成功统一了多种自监督对比学习方法，ADC方法为解决无标签学习中的类信息保持问题提供了有效解决方案，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous

quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
computations.

Conclusion: 研究为部分识别方法提供了实用的评估框架和工具支持，通过开源的CausalBoundingEngine包使研究者能够统一应用和比较各种边界方法。

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

Conclusion: FedOL通过单轮通信和知识蒸馏有效解决了联邦学习中的资源异构和通信开销问题，允许异构模型架构，在保护隐私的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 通过随机梯度的本质变化自动调整学习率是一种有效且无需手动调参的方案

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

### [211] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了输入时间缩放范式，通过在训练和测试时使用不同的查询策略来精炼输入，达到了SOTA性能。反传统认知，这里较低质量的数据集反而获得了更好的效果，小规模数据足以激活高级推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通常通过数据和训练缩放以及推理时间缩放来提升性能，论文想要补充这些方法，通过在输入时间投入资源来进一步提升模型表现。

Method: 提出输入时间缩放范式，在训练和测试阶段都使用元知识来精炼输入。发现训练-测试协同设计现象，需要在两个阶段都应用查询策略。使用低质量数据集甚至混入无关信息来进行训练。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型上达到了32B模型在AIME24(76.7%) 和 AIME25(76.7%) 上的SOTA性能。通过三个模型多数决策，可以进一步达到AIME24(76.7%) 和 AIME25(80%)。从DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B开始，最佳结果为AIME24(86.7%) 和 AIME25(76.7%)。

Conclusion: 输入时间缩放是一种有效的新范式，反传统的"垃圾进垃圾出"偏见，证明了"少而精"现象。小规模高质量数据比大规模低质量数据更有效，这些发现将开源以便进一步研究。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预训练模型的发展，现代ML工作流超越了传统的超参数优化，需要微调、集成等适应技术，但现有AutoML方法无法处理日益异构的ML流水线。

Method: 提出PS-PFN方法，将后验采样扩展到最大k臂老虎机问题设置，利用先验数据拟合网络通过上下文学习高效估计最大值后验分布，并支持不同成本和每臂独立建模。

Result: 在一个新颖和两个现有标准基准任务上的实验结果表明，PS-PFN相比其他老虎机和AutoML策略具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PS-PFN成功扩展了CASH框架，为现代ML流水线的选择和适应提供了有效的AutoML解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Result: 在SMAC基准测试中，该方法在多个地图上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的自注意力通信模块是有效的，能够以奖励驱动的方式学习生成消息，提升多智能体协作性能。

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的重尾带宝矮研究几乎完全集中在随机渡动下，而在对抗性渡动下的研究非常稀缺，特别是对于线性带宝矮问题。这篇论文尝试填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出了一个通用框架，在损失估计中添加奖励函数来进行FTRL优化。设计了精巧的奖励函数设置，并提出了重尾噪声感知稳定性-惩罚匹配（HT-SPM）学习率策略。

Result: 开发了第一个FTRL型的重尾MAB算法，在对抗性渡动下达到O(T^(1/ε))最差后悔，在随机渡动下达到O(log T)间隔依赖后悔。同时获得了线性带宝矮的O(d^(1/2)T^(1/ε))后悔界，匹配随机渡动下的最佳结果。

Conclusion: 这个框架为对抗性重尾带宝矮问题提供了一个统一的解决方案，通过HT-SPM学习率策略在两种渡动下都能获得最优性能，填补了该领域的重要研究空白。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Conclusion: 该研究为单机调度问题提供了一种灵活可实际应用的数据驱动方案，并填补了ML模型选择方面的研究空白

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

Result: 在真实供应链数据集上实验证明，相比多个基线方法能够提供更准确的信用评估，同时保持透明度和隐私性

Conclusion: Trans-XFed架构有效解决了供应链信用评估的多重挑战，实现了准确、透明且隐私保护的信用评估解决方案

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DREAMS是一种新的降维方法，通过正则化项结合t-SNE的局部结构保持和PCA的全局结构保持，生成在两种嵌入之间的连续谱，有效平衡多尺度结构保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维方法要么专注于保持局部结构（如t-SNE、UMAP），要么专注于保持全局结构（如MDS、PCA），但缺乏能够同时良好保持两种结构的方法。

Method: 通过简单的正则化项将t-SNE的局部结构保持与PCA的全局结构保持相结合，生成从局部结构良好到全局结构良好的嵌入谱。

Result: 在7个真实数据集（包括5个单细胞转录组数据集和1个群体遗传学数据集）上进行了基准测试，定性和定量结果均显示DREAMS在多尺度结构保持方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DREAMS方法成功解决了现有降维技术无法同时保持局部和全局结构的问题，提供了一种有效平衡多尺度结构保持的新解决方案。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Motivation: 传统老虎机算法主要关注最大化累积奖励，但夏普比率优化需要在获得高回报和控制风险之间取得平衡，这要求对均值和方差都进行仔细探索。

Method: 采用Thompson Sampling算法，假设奖励服从高斯分布且参数未知。提出了专门针对夏普比率的遗憾分解方法，并设计了SRTS算法。

Result: 理论分析表明SRTS算法实现了对数遗憾，并证明了其阶数最优性。实证模拟显示该算法显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: Thompson Sampling在夏普比率最大化问题上表现优异，既能有效探索风险调整后的性能差异，又能实现理论上的最优性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现GRPO算法存在系统性偏差，过度加权中等准确率样本而忽视低准确率的关键难题，限制了强化学习在语言模型推理能力开发中的潜力。

Method: 提出Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS)方法，通过多阶段rollout重新加权难题；同时采用大规模批次训练扩展数据广度，结合为DARS-B方法。

Result: DARS在不增加推理成本的情况下带来一致的Pass@K提升；大规模批次训练显著提高Pass@1性能；DARS-B同时提升Pass@K和Pass@1表现。

Conclusion: 深度自适应探索和广度扩展是RLVR中正交的两个维度，共同释放强化学习在语言模型推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

Motivation: 重新考察自注意力机制在时间序列预测中的效果，解决Transformer模型在时间序列预测中效果存在争议的问题。

Method: 设计周期嵌套相对注意偏置来抓取周期结构，使用分组注意力机制来处理多重共存周期性（如日周期和周周期），每个组采用多查询注意机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试集上的广泛实验表明，PENGUIN持续超过了基于MLP和Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: 显式建模周期模式和相对注意偏置对于时间序列建模至关重要，PENGUIN提供了一种简单但有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

Motivation: 联邦学习中通信效率仍是关键瓶颈，尤其在异构和动态客户参与的情况下。尽管存在方法如FedAvg、FedProx等尝试缓解通信成本，但选择每轮客户数量的问题仍很少被深入研究。

Method: 提出智能参与者选择（ISP）机制，通过动态确定每轮训练的最优客户数量来提高通信效率。方法在多种设置下进行验证，包括视觉Transformer、真实世界ECG分类以及梯度压缩训练。

Result: 结果显示ISP能够一致节省达30%的通信开销，且不会影响最终模型质量。在不同的真实世界ECG分类设置中，选择客户数量被证明为联邦学习中一个独立的重要任务。

Conclusion: ISP机制有效解决了联邦学习中通信效率的问题，通过动态选择每轮客户数量，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少通信成本，为联邦学习的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

*Nicolò Romandini,Cristian Borcea,Rebecca Montanari,Luca Foschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP是一种轻量级联邦遗忘算法，通过剪枝特定连接来高效消除恶意客户端对全局模型的影响，无需完全重新训练，在保持良性数据性能的同时有效降低恶意数据准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到模型投毒攻击，传统联邦遗忘假设客户端可信且合作，但在恶意客户端可能共谋的实际场景中，这种假设不成立，需要新的解决方案。

Method: FedUP利用最后一轮训练中的客户端权重，识别并抑制良性客户端和恶意客户端更新之间差异最大的高幅度权重连接，通过精心选择和归零这些权重来隔离恶意影响。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据、标签翻转和后门攻击等多种场景下，FedUP能有效降低恶意影响，将恶意数据准确率降至与从头训练模型相当的水平，同时保持良性数据性能，且比现有方法更快、更节省存储。

Conclusion: FedUP提供了一种高效、鲁棒的联邦遗忘解决方案，能够在恶意客户端可能共谋的强对抗环境下有效消除恶意影响，为联邦学习安全性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

Motivation: 现有的1998年评估框架无法满足当今生物识别技术发展和漏洞需求，需要更可靠的框架来评估不同生物识别模态的适用性。

Method: 通过24位生物识别专家调查，对各模态进行评分，并将专家评估与55个生物识别数据集的统计不确定性进行对比分析。

Result: 发现各模态评分显著变化：面部识别因技术进步而提升，指纹识别因漏洞攻击而可靠性下降，专家评估与数据集结果在大多数模态上强一致。

Conclusion: 专家见解与实证数据结合的方法有效。专家分歧为未来研究指明了关键挑战，需要解决这些问题来提升生物识别系统的可靠性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

*Yishun Lu,Wesley Armour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP)是一种新方法，通过利用两个子批次的梯度构建方差感知更新方向，在大批量训练中恢复二阶方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU支持大批量训练（数万个样本），但现有优化器在大批量下表现不佳。一阶方法因梯度噪声减少而难以逃离次优极小值，二阶方法（如KFAC）需要过高阻尼而失去曲率信息优势。

Method: FOP利用两个子批次的梯度，在Fisher度量下将梯度差异的正交分量增强到平均梯度中，构建方差感知的更新方向。

Result: FOP能够在大批量训练中恢复二阶方法的有效性，实现可扩展训练，具有更好的泛化能力和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FOP技术成功解决了大批量训练中优化器性能下降的问题，为大规模深度学习训练提供了有效的二阶优化解决方案。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

TL;DR: 基于流匹配框架的一步行为生成方法OFQL，解决了污染Q学习多步去噪问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升训练和推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 污染Q学习(DQL)在离线强化学习中表现突出，但因需要多步去噪过程导致训练和推理效率低下，而简单采用一步去噪又会导致性能大幅下降

Method: 提出One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL)框架，将DQL重构在流匹配(FM)框架中，学习平均速度场来支持直接的一步行为生成，避免传统FM的曲线生成路径

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，OFQL表现超过DQL和其他污染基线，同时大幅缩短了训练和推理时间

Conclusion: OFQL通过流匹配框架实现了高效的一步行为生成，为离线强化学习提供了更加高效可用的污染基方法

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于边缘计算的端到端预测框架，通过轻量化Transformer和LSTM模型在FPGA设备上实现低能耗的污水溢流池水位预测，解决了传统云计算方案在通信故障时的可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端天气事件加剧了老化合流制污水系统的污水溢流风险，传统云基AI预测模型在通信故障时存在可靠性问题，需要开发能够在边缘设备上高效运行的本地预测方案。

Method: 集成轻量化Transformer和LSTM模型，通过整数量化压缩提高运行效率，使用自动化硬件感知部署流程在AMD Spartan-7 FPGA上搜索最优模型配置，同时最小化预测误差和能量消耗。

Result: 8位Transformer模型在24小时历史数据训练下实现高精度（MSE 0.0376），每次推理能耗0.370 mJ；8位LSTM模型能耗更低（0.009 mJ，降低40倍）但精度下降14.89%（MSE 0.0432）且训练时间更长。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了本地化、能效高的预测能力，为合流制污水系统提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，根据部署优先级可选择Transformer（高精度）或LSTM（超低能耗）模型。

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用分类分布替代高斯分布来表示多模态策略，通过中间分类分布选择行为模式，改善连续控制中的探索效率和策略性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习策略通常使用高斯分布参数化，限制了学习到的行为只能是单模态的，而许多实际决策问题需要多模态策略来进行鲁棒的环境探索和适应不同情境

Method: 引入分类策略，使用中间分类分布建模多模态行为模式，然后基于采样的模式生成输出动作。探索了两种采样方案来确保可微分的离散潜在结构，同时保持基于梯度的优化效率

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite环境中评估，通过更好的探索，学习到的策略收敛更快且性能优于标准高斯策略

Conclusion: 分类分布是连续控制中结构化探索和多模态行为表示的强大工具

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Result: 现有AutoFE方法存在严重的易用性问题：难以使用、缺乏文档、没有活跃社区，且无法设置时间和内存限制

Conclusion: 本研究强调了开发更具可用性、工程化质量的自动化特征工程方法的紧迫性

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了线性标量化权重选择与多任务优化指标之间的内在联系，提出的AutoScale框架能够有效指导权重选择，无需昂贵的权重搜索过程。

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

Motivation: 传统上下文带带模型无法满足多用户同时交互的实际广告场景需求，需要考虑流水线反馈、并行上下文会话和异质武器奖励结构。

Method: 设计了UCBBP(上信心区间背向规划)算法，并在此基础上提出AUCBBP(主动上信心区间背向规划)算法，通过选择性探索来提高用户缩放效率。

Result: UCBBP达到了$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$的悔弊界限，AUCBBP进一步改善了上下文缩放效率，悔弊界限为$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$,数值实验验证了算法的实践有效性。

Conclusion: MCCB模型和相关算法有效地处理了多用户同时交互的组合带带问题，AUCBBP在用户缩放方面显示出明显的效率优势。

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be
instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

Conclusion: ASDFormer不仅提高了分类性能，还提供了更可解释的疾病相关生物标志物识别，展示了其作为生物标志物发现工具的潜力。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

TL;DR: BLIPs是一个贝叶斯学习原子间势能框架，通过变分dropout方法为机器学习原子间势能模型提供校准的不确定性估计，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习原子间势能模型在分布外数据和数据稀缺情况下预测准确性差，且缺乏不确定性估计，无法指导主动学习和确保模拟准确性。

Method: 提出BLIPs框架，基于自适应变分dropout方法，构建可扩展的架构无关变分贝叶斯框架，用于训练或微调MLIPs。

Result: 在计算化学任务中显示出比标准MLIPs更好的预测准确性，提供可信的不确定性估计，特别是在数据稀缺和分布外场景下。微调预训练模型也能获得性能提升。

Conclusion: BLIPs框架成功解决了MLIPs的不确定性估计问题，为模拟化学提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中为复杂任务设计好的奖励函数很困难，现有方法结合偏好和演示数据的方式往往不够灵活或难以扩展

Method: 提出了reward-rational partial orderings框架，并开发了LEOPARD算法，能够从多种反馈类型（包括负面演示）中学习奖励函数

Result: 在有限偏好和演示反馈数据下，LEOPARD相比现有基线方法有显著优势，结合多种反馈类型通常比单一反馈更有效

Conclusion: LEOPARD提供了一个灵活可扩展的框架，能够有效利用多种人类反馈类型来学习奖励函数，在复杂任务中表现出色

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变来提高医疗AI在胸部X光片诊断中的准确性和可信过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI在临床诊断中遇到的不确定性问题，因为AI仅依靠病变数据学习，缺乏医生所具备的丰富背景知识和临床经验，导致医生对AI系统的信任度低

Method: 提出不确定性感知学习策略，同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变信息。使用阿宋大学医院2,517张无病变图像和656张结节图像进行训练

Result: 提案模型达到92%准确率（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感度比基准模型提高10%，不确定性表征量熵体降低0.2

Conclusion: 通过学习医生的背景知识，可以有效减少医疗AI的诊断不确定性，提高诊断准确性和可靠性，为医疗AI的临床应用提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 通过神经网络优化WENO算法的权重函数，在保持闪冲捕捉能力的同时提高了导数计算的频谱精度，能够更准确地模拟高频波和小程度流场特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典高阶WENO算法虽然在平滑解方面有优称收敛性能，但其频谱特性不理想，限制了对高频波和小程度特征的捕捉能力。

Method: 通过近似集散关系(ADR)分析，将频谱错误与三角函数重构错误联系起来，在WENO5-JS/Z算法的权重函数中添加由神经网络参数化的补偿项，通过最小化重构错误来优化频谱精度，同时在损失函数中加入TVD约束和反液化罚项以保持稳定性。

Result: 新算法WENO5-JS/Z-NN在保持闪冲捕捉能力的同时，对细小流场特征提供了更高的分辨率。ADR分析显示，新算法在更宽的波数范围内能更准确地匹配准确的频谱。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的优化方法有效地改善了WENO算法的频谱特性，为高频波和小程度流动现象的准确模拟提供了更好的数值工具。

Abstract: Classical high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are
designed to achieve optimal convergence order for smooth solutions and to
maintain non-oscillatory behaviors for discontinuities. However, their spectral
properties are not optimal, which limits the ability to capture high-frequency
waves and small-scale features. In this paper, we propose a data-driven
optimized method to improve the spectral properties of the WENO schemes. By
analyzing the approximate dispersion relation (ADR), the spectral error of the
schemes can be bounded by the reconstructed errors of a series of trigonometric
functions with different wavenumbers. Therefore, we propose the new schemes
WENO5-JS/Z-NN that introduce a compensation term parameterized by a neural
network to the weight function of the WENO5-JS/Z schemes. The neural network is
trained such that the generated weights can minimize the reconstructed errors
over a large number of spatial stencils, and furthermore, improve the spectral
accuracy. Meanwhile, the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) constraint and
anti-dissipation penalization are incorporated into the loss function to
enhance the shock-capturing capability and preserve stability in simulating
high-frequency waves. Compared to WENO5-JS/Z, our schemes maintain the ability
to capture discontinuities while providing higher resolution for fine-scale
flow features. The ADR indicates that the new schemes can match the exact
spectrum more accurately over a broader range of wavenumbers.

Motivation: 研究n-正确集合中多项式插值的几何特性，特别是探讨通过公共节点的2节点线的最大可能数量及其对集合结构的影响。

Method: 使用代数几何和多项式插值理论的方法，分析n-正确集合中节点的配置关系，特别是研究2节点线和最大线之间的相互作用。

Result: 证明了通过公共节点B的2节点线最大数量为n条；当达到最大值时，集合包含恰好n条不通过B的最大线；对于GC_n集合，还存在一条通过B的额外最大线。

Conclusion: 这些结果为理解n-正确集合的几何结构提供了重要见解，特别是揭示了2节点线数量与最大线配置之间的紧密联系，并建立了与Carnicer-Gasca集合的联系。

Abstract: An $n$-correct set $\mathcal{X}$ in the plane is a set of nodes admitting
unique
  interpolation with bivariate polynomials of total degree at most $n$. A
$k$-node line is a line passing through exactly $k$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$ A
line can pass through at most $n+1$ nodes of an $n$-correct set. An
$(n+1)$-node line is called maximal line (C. de Boor, 2007). We say that a node
$A\in\mathcal{X}$ uses a line $\ell,$ if $\ell$ is a factor of the fundamental
polynomial of the node $A.$
  Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an $n$-correct set. One of the main problems we study in
this paper is to determine the maximum possible number of used $2$-node lines
that share a common node $B \in\mathcal{X}.$ We show that this number equals
$n$. Moreover, if there are $n$ such $2$-node lines, then $\mathcal{X}$
contains exactly $n$ maximal lines not passing through the common node $B$.
Furthermore, if $\mathcal{X}$ is $GC_n$ set, there exists an additional maximal
line passing through $B$. Hence, in this case, $\mathcal{X}$ has $n+1$ maximal
lines and is Carnicer~Gasca set of degree $n$. Note that Carnicer~Gasca sets of
degree $n$ with a prescribed set of $n$ used $2$-node lines can be readily
constructed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的表面Stokes方程数值方法需要满足离散inf-sup条件，这限制了数值方法的灵活性。本文旨在开发一种不依赖离散inf-sup条件的稳健数值方法

Method: 将表面Stokes方程重构为非对称不定椭圆问题（由两个拉普拉斯算子控制），采用提升参数有限元方法，假设无几何误差

Result: 证明了方法的适定性、在鲁棒网格相关H1范数下的拟最佳逼近性，以及速度和压力的最优L2误差估计。数值实验验证了方法的准确性和实用性

Conclusion: 所提出的方法规避了传统离散inf-sup条件的要求，网格尺寸仅依赖于Weingarten映射，适用于任意多项式阶的等阶和不等阶速度-压力对

Abstract: For a $d$-dimensional hypersurface of class $C^3$ without boundary, we
reformulate the surface Stokes equations as a nonsymmetric indefinite elliptic
problem governed by two Laplacians. We then use this elliptic reformulation as
a basis for a numerical method based on lifted parametric FEM. Assuming no
geometric error for simplicity, we prove its well-posedness, quasi-best
approximation in a robust mesh-dependent $H^1$-norm for any polynomial degree,
as well as an optimal $L^2$ error estimate for both velocity and pressure. This
entails a sufficiently small mesh size that solely depends on the Weingarten
map and circumvents the usual discrete inf-sup condition. We present numerical
experiments for velocity-pressure pairs with equal and disparate polynomial
degrees, demonstrating that the proposed method is both accurate and practical.

Motivation: 研究Chorin投影方法结合有限元空间离散化求解非定常不可压Navier-Stokes方程的数学理论保证，证明该方法生成的数值解能够收敛到物理意义上的弱解

Method: 采用两步法：预测步计算中间速度场（不一定无散），投影步通过投影到无散子空间来强制不可压条件。建立离散能量不等式获得先验估计，结合新的紧致性结果证明数值解在L^2空间中的预紧性

Result: 证明了数值近似解（在子序列意义下）收敛到Navier-Stokes方程的Leray-Hopf弱解，无需超出平方可积初始数据的额外正则性假设

Conclusion: 成功建立了Chorin投影有限元方法的数学收敛理论，解决了中间速度场和投影速度场具有不同先验估计的技术难题，为该方法提供了严格的理论基础

Abstract: We study Chorin's projection method combined with a finite element spatial
discretization for the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The scheme advances the solution in two steps: a prediction step, which
computes an intermediate velocity field that is generally not divergence-free,
and a projection step, which enforces incompressibility by projecting this
velocity onto the divergence-free subspace. We establish convergence, up to a
subsequence, of the numerical approximations generated by this scheme to a
Leray-Hopf weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, without any additional
regularity assumptions beyond square-integrable initial data. A discrete energy
inequality yields a priori estimates, which we combine with a new compactness
result to prove precompactness of the approximations in
$L^2([0,T]\times\Omega)$, where $[0,T]$ is the time interval and $\Omega$ is
the spatial domain. Passing to the limit as the discretization parameters
vanish, we obtain a weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. A central
difficulty is that different a priori bounds are available for the intermediate
and projected velocity fields; our compactness argument carefully integrates
these estimates to complete the convergence proof.

Conclusion: GRC方法为BiCGSTAB算法提供了有效的稳定机制，增强了其在求解椭圆型偏微分方程等大型稀疏线性系统问题中的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: The residual cutting (RC) method has been proposed as an outer-inner loop
iteration for efficiently solving large and sparse linear systems of equations
arising in solving numerically problems of elliptic partial differential
equations. Then based on RC the generalized residual cutting (GRC) method has
been introduced, which can be applied to more general sparse linear systems
problems. In this paper, we show that GRC can stabilize the BiCGSTAB, which is
also an iterative algorithm for solving large, sparse, and nonsymmetric linear
systems, and widely used in scientific computing and engineering simulations,
due to its robustness. BiCGSTAB converges faster and more smoothly than the
original BiCG method, by reducing irregular convergence behavior by stabilizing
residuals. However, it sometimes fails to converge due to stagnation or
breakdown. We attempt to emphasize its robustness by further stabililizing it
by GRC, avoiding such failures.

Abstract: Standard finite difference (SFD) schemes often suffer from limited stability
regions, especially when applied in explicit setup to partial differential
equations. To address this challenge, this study investigates the efficacy of
nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes in enhancing stability of explicit
SFD schemes for 1D and 2D Caputo-type time-fractional diffusion equations
(TFDEs). A nonstandard L1approximation is proposed for the Caputo fractional
derivative, and its local truncation error is derived analytically. This
nonstandard L1 formulation is used to construct the NSFD scheme for a
Caputo-type time-fractional initial value problem. The absolute stability of
the resulting scheme is rigorously examined using the boundary locus method,
and its performance is validated through numerical simulations on test examples
for various choices of denominator functions. Based on this framework, two
explicit NSFD schemes are developed for 1D and 2D cases of the Caputo-type
TFDE. Their stability is further assessed through the discrete energy method,
with particular focus on the expansion of stability region relative to SFD
schemes. The convergence of the proposed NSFD schemes is also established.
Finally, a comprehensive set of numerical experiments is conducted to
demonstrate the accuracy and stability advantages of proposed methods, with
results presented through tables and graphical illustrations.

Conclusion: 该数值方案具有灵活性和稳健性，能够高效解决分布阶分数偏微分方程，显著降低计算复杂度和成本。

Abstract: We propose a kernel compression method for solving Distributed-Order (DO)
Fractional Partial Differential Equations (DOFPDEs) at the cost of solving
corresponding local-in-time PDEs. The key concepts are (1) discretization of
the integral over the order of the fractional derivative and (2) approximation
of linear combinations of integral kernels with exponential sums, expressing
the non-local history term as a sum of auxiliary variables that solve a weakly
coupled, local in time system of PDEs. For the second step, we introduce an
improved algorithm that approximates the occurring integral kernels with double
precision accuracy using only a moderate number (<100) of exponential terms.
After temporal discretization using implicit Runge--Kutta methods, we exploit
the inherent structure of the PDE system to obtain the solution at each time
step by solving a single PDE. At the same time, the auxiliary variables are
computed by a linear update, not even requiring a matrix-vector multiplication.
Choosing temporal meshes with a grading factor corresponding to the convergence
order of the Runge--Kutta schemes, we achieve the optimal decay of the temporal
discretization error. The flexibility and robustness of our numerical scheme
are illustrated by recreating well-studied test cases and solving linear and
nonlinear DOFPDEs in 2D and 3D with up to 40 million spatial degrees of
freedom.

optimal error estimates $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r})$ for initial data $u_0 \in H^r(I)$
with $r \geq \alpha + 2$ and exponential convergence $\mathcal{O}(e^{-cN})$ for
smooth solutions. Numerical experiments validate orbital stability of solitary

Abstract: Investigation of the approximation properties, convergence, and stability of
the ADER-DG method for solving an ODE system is carried out. The ADER-DG method
generates a new implicit RK method, which is similar in its properties to the
original ADER-DG method. The ADER-DG method has an approximation order $2N+1$
when using polynomials of degree $N$ for the numerical solution at grid nodes,
and demonstrates superconvergence. The local solution obtained by the local DG
predictor has an approximation order $N+1$ and has a subgrid resolution. The
ADER-DG method is $A$- and $AN$-stable, $L$-stable, $B$- and $BN$-stable, and
algebraically stable. Applications of the ADER-DG method demonstrated
compliance with the expected theoretical results.

Conclusion: 提出的数学框架为defeaturing操作提供了严格的误差控制方法，有助于改进工业仿真流程的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Feature removal from computational geometries, or defeaturing, is an integral
part of industrial simulation pipelines. Defeaturing simplifies the otherwise
costly or even impossible meshing process, speeds up the simulation, and lowers
its memory footprint. Current defeaturing operators are often based on
heuristic criteria and ignore the impact of the simplifications on the PDE
solution. This work extends the mathematically rigorous framework developed by
Buffa, Chanon, and V\'azquez (2022) to features subject to Dirichlet boundary
conditions in Poisson problems. We derive a posteriori error estimators for
negative features in the interior or on the boundary of the computational
domain. The estimators' dependence on the feature size is explicit, and their
evaluation only involves boundary integrals over the feature boundary.
Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions showcase the validity and
efficiency of the estimators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HDG离散椭圆最优控制问题产生的非对称正定线性系统的有效求解方法，传统方法在处理这类问题时可能效率不高

Method: 采用平衡约束域分解(BDDC)算法作为预处理器，结合广义最小残差(GMRES)求解器，对HDG离散产生的系统进行求解

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，当子域尺寸足够小时，算法对正则化参数具有鲁棒性，迭代次数与子域数量无关，仅轻微依赖于子域问题规模

Conclusion: BDDC预处理的GMRES方法为HDG离散椭圆最优控制问题提供了一种高效、可扩展的求解方案，具有良好的理论和数值性能

Abstract: In this work, a balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC)
algorithm is applied to the nonsymmetric positive definite linear system
arising from the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretization of an
elliptic distributed optimal control problem. Convergence analysis for the BDDC
preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES) solver demonstrates that,
when the subdomain size is small enough, the algorithm is robust with respect
to the regularization parameter, and the number of iterations is independent of
the number of subdomains and depends only slightly on the subdomain problem
size. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical results.

Conclusion: DRLM方法在理论上和数值上都表现出良好的收敛性能，为不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程的数值求解提供了有效工具

Abstract: This paper is concerned with temporal convergence analysis of the recently
introduced Dynamically Regularized Lagrange Multiplier (DRLM) method for the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A key feature of the DRLM approach is
the incorporation of the kinetic energy evolution through a quadratic dynamic
equation involving a time-dependent Lagrange multiplier and a regularization
parameter. We apply the backward Euler method with an explicit treatment of the
nonlinear convection term and show the unique solvability of the resulting
first-order DRLM scheme. Optimal error estimates for the velocity and pressure
are established based on a uniform bound on the Lagrange multiplier and
mathematical induction. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence
rates and error bounds that decay with respect to the regularization parameter.
