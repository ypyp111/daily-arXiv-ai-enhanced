Bifurcation analysis reveals that\nimperfections lower the critical overpressure for buckling, guiding the bubble\nalong stable branches with transitions influenced by the nature of the\nimperfections. The resulting branches emerge as unfoldings of bifurcation\ndiagrams and closely resemble solution families emanating from the standard\nbifurcation diagram of a perfect sphere. Dynamic simulations for fixed forcing\nfrequency demonstrate that the microbubble buckles at the defective pole and at\nmaximum compression adopts the shape corresponding to the buckled shape that\nemerges in the static bifurcation diagram for the same pressure disturbance.\nSimulations further reveal that the deformed microbubble exhibits translational\nmotion in the direction of concavity, driven by the balance between pressure\nand viscous drag, both aligned with this motion as a result of the deformed\nshape acquired by the microbubble. The translational speed is highly dependent\non the shell stretching and bending elasticities and forcing frequency, with an\noptimal speed achieved when the forcing frequency equals the difference between\nthe resonance frequencies of the initial shape and the compressed static shape\ncorresponding to the imposed sound amplitude. Higher sound amplitude or lower\nbending resistance lead to more pronounced deformations that enhance\ntranslational motion.

Data-driven frameworks have been widely used to obtain low-order\nmodels of aerodynamic systems; yet, resulting models tend to yield predictions\nthat grow unbounded with time. Recently introduced stability-promoting methods\ncan facilitate the identification of bounded models, but tend to require\nextensive brute-force tuning even in the context of simple academic systems.\nHere, we show how recent theoretical advances in the long-term boundedness of\ndynamical systems can be integrated into data-driven modeling frameworks to\nensure that resulting models will yield bounded predictions of incompressible\nflows. Specifically, we propose to solve a specific set of convex semi-definite\nprogramming problems to (i) certify whether a system admits a globally\nattracting bounded set for the chosen modeling parameters, and (ii) compute a\nmodel with the optimal (tightest) bound on this globally attracting set. We\ndemonstrate the approach via integration within the sparse identification of\nnonlinear dynamics (SINDy) modeling framework.

In test-time scaling, by using more\ncomputational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning\nprocess and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as\ndistilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding\nsearch space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that\nhelp score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently\nexplore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm\ncommonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free\nscaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be\nprompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify\nprocess paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no\ndetailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse\nverification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover\nthe diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier\ntraining, types and their utility in test-time scaling.

In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding\nthrough two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations\nreflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how\nconsistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the\nevaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,\noffering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with\ncurrent clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of\nrationales of ICD coding.

The viscoelastic stress computed from the conformation tensor is\ndirectly embedded into the hydrodynamic field using a newly proposed local\nvelocity discretization scheme, thereby avoiding spatial gradient calculations.\nThe constitutive equations are treated as convection-diffusion equations and\nsolved using an improved convection-diffusion model specifically designed for\nthis purpose, incorporating a novel auxiliary source term that eliminates the\nneed for spatial and temporal derivative computations. Additionally, a\nconservative non-equilibrium bounce-back (CNEBB) scheme is proposed for\nimplementing solid wall boundary conditions in the constitutive equations. The\nrobustness of the present algorithm is validated through a series of benchmark\nproblems.

To\ninvestigate precisely this question, we experimentally generate droplets in\nthermodynamical equilibrium with their own vapor, even before impact, such that\nminute energy exchanges of the droplet with its surroundings can trigger phase\nchange. Using a frustrated total internal reflection (TIR) setup, we make the\nexciting observation that depending on the impact speed and vapor conditions,\nthe entrapment of vapor can be completely suppressed under boiling liquid\nconditions.

The forcing is random and isotropic, applied in\ntwo distinct wavenumber bands (kf = [3, 4] and [6, 7]). Notably, bursting is\nobserved only for small forcing wavenumber, kf = [3, 4] and not at kf = [6, 7],\nfor the same rotation rate and initial conditions. These bursting events are\nassociated with forward cascade of energy in contrast to the inverse cascade of\nrotating turbulence, as confirmed from the ring spectrum and time-series of\nmodal kinetic energy of modes with kz = 2, 3. Identifying some of the triads\ninvolved in the energy transfer from modal analysis, we also calculate the\nmode-to-mode energy transfer.

To enable controlled comparisons, we also include\na text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with\nLLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character\nrecognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two\ncomplementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level\nrecall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation\nusing a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,\nand reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a\nreward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve\na mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain.

To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity\nRepresentations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a\nmulti-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained\nknowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting\nand alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nwe design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy.

Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models\nrely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to\nassess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible\nassessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,\nhuman-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to\nreplicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in\ntext-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization\nof debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct\ntext-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a\ngiven utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use\nNormalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,\nrespectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair\nDiffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that\nmost default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated\nsolutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find\nbetter hyperparameters."}

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the\nedge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and\nentropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and\ntime-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area."}

In this study,\nwe propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which\nreconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing\nsynchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during\ntraining, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first\nstage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\\beta$-variation autoencoder\n($p$C-$\\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the\nintrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized\nlow-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling\nreconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once\ntrained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure\ninputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the\n$p$C-$\\beta$-VAE decoder.

The digital twin updates the patient\nstate with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate\nclinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a\nconservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training\nsplit. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential\nmoving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and\ncontraindications before any action is applied.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse.

Furthermore, conventional\nfeature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to\nreconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal\nclassification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the\nMulti-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that\nintegrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.\nSpecifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet\nBackbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement\nRouting (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature\nrepresentations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and\nglobal contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these\nmulti-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,\nequipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.\nFinally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by\nidentifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the\nsimple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the\nmost coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps\nachieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently\nsurpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with\nconfigurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)\nto a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in\nadvancing feature representation learning."}

To address this, we propose\nRouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA\nexpert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher\nLLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge\n(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).\nWe then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge\ntogether with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a\ndynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router\nbalances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based\non input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further\nimprove inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module\nto reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning.

First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic\nfeature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,\nespecially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)\ncompresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding\ndiscriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends\nto discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments.

This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression.

By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient\nregions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal\nin textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term\nloss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.\nExperiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration\nerror from 6.2\\,px to ~2.4\\,px and increases the AUC at 25\\,px from 0.770 to\n0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods.

A core\nlimitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the\nunexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or\nBayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture\nwhether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce\nMutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not\nas anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the\nimpact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems\nto reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test\nsequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and\npropose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically\ngoverns system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.\nEmpirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map\nestimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform\nclassical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and\npredictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS\noffers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems."}

We show that using only\ngeneral-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able\nto achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical\nmulti-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel\nanalysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved\nimages each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these\ncases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval\nmodels. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these\nchallenging cases over standard RAG.

This issue is particularly critical in\nindustrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.\nProbabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction\nuncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape\ndistribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution\nparameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target\ndistributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nTabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for\nunivariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like\nRealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow\nconsists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical\nfeature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature\nextraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and\ntractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic\nregression models on likelihood scores.

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to\ndifferentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a\ndecision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results\nshow that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness\nand accuracy in the presence of biased data.

Textually, to address the issue of\nincomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates\nsynonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and\nconstructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy\nand persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual\nnoise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative\nregions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,\neffectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.\nGiven the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual\nprompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time\nadaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual\nalignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs."}

Preliminary results\nindicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not\nonly enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development\nof more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is\nanticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving\nthe way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics."}

To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional\ngeneration strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based\nmodel to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''\nmodel, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment\nimages. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing\niterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate\nthat JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks\nincluding DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both\nquantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong\ngeneralization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems."}

By amortizing computation across common prefixes and\npruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update\ncompute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates\nthe KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along\nwith an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage\nestimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.\nand (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic\ndivergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain\nof TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours\nfrom 22\\% up to 43\\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile\nshowing up to 40\\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\\% at token-level\nsampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of\ninference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based\npost-training with fewer samples and less compute.

Given a time-varying sequence of persistence\ndiagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar\nfields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at \"inverting\"\nthe non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the\ncorresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which\nlearns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based\non the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the\nnon-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific\ntopological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical\nand topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,\ngiven an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach\ninstantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input\nthrough the network.

To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment\nRetrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,\ncomprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As\na foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue\nretrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each\nnaturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in\nreal-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising\nreal-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on\nthese resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image\nfragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,\nthese models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within\nretrieved fragments.

Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large\nlanguage models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we\ngeneralize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which\nmotivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a\nnovel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel\nrisk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration\nerrors.

Through\nexperiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our\ntheoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.\nNotably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the\nmodel's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging\ntoward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity\nunder softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at\nlow temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of\nsoftmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust\nnormalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures."}

However,\nchallenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce\ndata drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety\nviolations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision\narchitecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road\nenvironment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments.

To address these limitations, existing works\nhave applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and\nemployed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.\nHowever, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation\nstage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which\nstages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal\npolicies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance\n(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process\nrefining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate\nguidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a\nvisual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to\nevaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning.

However, deploying SemCom over digital\nsystems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against\ntransmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature\nimputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial\nerror concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature\ndistortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a\nproperty crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the\nsubsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a\ngenerative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to\nefficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we\ndevelop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error\nprotection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic\nimportance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint\nSource-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,\nachieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch\nSimilarity (LPIPS) scores."}
