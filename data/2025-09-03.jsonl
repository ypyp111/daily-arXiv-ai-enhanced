Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

We extract\nQuery-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the\nself-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the\nmatrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of\nsingular values into matrices according to projection's type.

To\naddress this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates\nbreast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve\ndiagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts\nand fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects\nwith confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold\ncross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The\nresults show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines\nin classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image\nencoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal\nsetting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and\n0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to\nserve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and\nimproving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management."}

Here, we go beyond the development of a single\nmodel and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both\ninformation technology and operational technology data streams to identify,\ncharacterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)\nbetween cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue\nUniversitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a\nrepresentative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections\nand denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor\nconditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and\nover 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data\npoints. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between\nnormal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging\nconditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and\ninformation technology data improved classification accuracy but posed\nchallenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber\nevents.

To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic\naggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.\nA speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on\nlarge-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive\nentropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed\nby a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By\nadjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the\nrepresentations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text\ntranslation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed\nrepresentations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Surprisingly,\nLLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a\ncompetitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs\ntrained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding\nbenchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).\nExtending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields\nLLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing\ncritic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.\nFinally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying\nself-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five\nrepresentative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal\nthat RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both\nevaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,\nself-improving multimodal systems."}

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning.

Recognizing\nthat a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity\nand variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.\nInspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.\nIn this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative\nparadigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then\nreconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop\nmechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further\npropose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position\nbetween the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly\nincreases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which\nenables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods\nin 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the\nself-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three\nvariants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,\nthe class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In\naddition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all\nhistorical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to\nrecognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,\nto enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage\nlimitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual\nlearning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised\nidentification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an\nunsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated\nto detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical\ndata, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a\ngenerator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new\ntask arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous\nlearnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the\nnewly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\nvalidated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised\nclassification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show\nthat the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies\nwhile maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals."}

Existing truncated sampling techniques, including\ntemperature scaling, top-\\$p\\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\\$p\\$ sampling, aim\nto manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in\nthe effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the\ncorresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\\$p\\$ sampling relies on a\nsingle top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the\ninformation of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of\nthe confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We\nfirst establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity\nand coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained\nminimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be\nequivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,\nwhich is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally\nefficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nalternative of min-\\$p\\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing\nbenchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as\nGPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms\nthat top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where\ncreativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in\nopen-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing\napplications.

Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through\nattention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full\nTransformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods\nsuch as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while\nrouting fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with\nsequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context\ninputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially\nreduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and\nscalable alternative to Transformers."}

We show that\nLGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,\nwith an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene\nexpression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in\nMSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered\nuninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.\nOur experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the\ncontext genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to\nconsiderable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full\narchitecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of\nits isolated components."}

While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity.

First, optimal hyperparameters for one\noptimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer\nunfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned\nbaselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for\n1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before\nreaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two\noptimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay.

Drawing on legal theory, we\nidentify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems\nconstrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We\nthen propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a\nrule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising\nambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative\naction), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce\ninconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide\njudicial discretion).

While this approach\nachieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles\nwith precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced\ndivision of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a\ntranslator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the\ngeneration module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring\nthe original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the\nnew content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding\nmodule is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning\ntasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce\nDraw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)\nDIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex\ninstruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K\nchain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design\nblueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable\nSANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM\ndataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit.

The\nmethod, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that\ncapture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using\nGaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected\nthrough a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is\noptimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.\nExperimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate\nidentification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with\nsystem operations."}

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space\nthroughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the\nflexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,\nboth of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.\nIn the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground\nand background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional\ncontextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level\nfeatures. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the\noriginal reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a\nfeature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental\nresults show that our method significantly improves the performance of\ndifferent SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets."}

In response, machine learning-based approaches have\nrecently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods\nsuch as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many\nrecent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more\nadvanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical\nsuccess index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective\nduring extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,\nrendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization.

Although\ncritical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers\nfrom `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of\ngeneralization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters\nstabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers\na general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when\nintegrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated\non extensive vision and language tasks.

In this work, we present a\nsystematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural\nperspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,\nand video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial\nUnderstanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of\nspatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the\nupper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial\nimagination.

As a result, these agents do not improve with more\nexperience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that\nimprove via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much\nlarger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,\nusing only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A\nprogram that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.\nTo address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial\ncredit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early\n(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static\nlanguage model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the\nagent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as\nreward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that\nperforming gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with\nRL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent\nscaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks."}

Field studies suggest that AI\ninterviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and\nqualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited\nemotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the\nutility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be\ncontext-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts."}

Existing MRI image\nsegmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which\nis inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In\nthis situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI\nmodalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,\nsuffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data\nheterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI\nimage segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves\nmultiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It\ndistinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and\ncross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel\nmodality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework\n(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality\ndecoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the\nmodality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored\nand modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,\ncorresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,\nrespectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of\nheterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the\nmodality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes\ndynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for\nincomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality\naggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of our methods."}

While this approach\nachieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles\nwith precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced\ndivision of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a\ntranslator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the\ngeneration module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring\nthe original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the\nnew content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding\nmodule is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning\ntasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce\nDraw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)\nDIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex\ninstruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K\nchain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design\nblueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable\nSANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM\ndataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit.

First, optimal hyperparameters for one\noptimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer\nunfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned\nbaselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for\n1.2B parameter models.

To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data\nperturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly\nutilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and\ndiversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data\nutility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation\nand data utility remains a critical challenge.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework\nfor the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on\ndata utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the\nupper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that\nperturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining\nfidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs\nlocal extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of\nindividual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted\nprivacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our\nmethod effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are\nvulnerable to MIA.

While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks.

Our results reveal that\nwhile explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their\nintegration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor\nconsistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.\nModels often default to their internal representations, particularly in general\ntasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.\nThese findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs\nprocess external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities."}

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,\nour proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested\nanisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and\nvideos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the\ndata and the shape of interest."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages\nunlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this\napproach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce\nnot only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$\ncan serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a\nwide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support\ndownstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward\ntuning.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nL3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten\nlow-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,\nMalayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000\nnews articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically\nsimilar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to\ntest fine-grained semantic understanding.

RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards\nto guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output\nquality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR\nparadigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from\nsparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in\nRL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\\textbf{PACS}$, a\nnovel RLVR framework that achieves im$\\textbf{P}$licit $\\textbf{A}$ctor\n$\\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By\ntreating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR\nproblem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by\nthe policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient\nanalysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the\nclassical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic\nroles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging\nmathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as\nPPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS\nachieves 59.78\\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32\nand 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a\npromising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and\ndata are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS."}

This creates a tension: while\npost-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions\nand reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and\nexploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We\naddress this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a\nframework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.\nAt its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure\ndiversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is\nthen combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,\nencouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.\nExperiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING\ngeneralizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and\ncreative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks\nin the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL\nbaselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and\nnovelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution\nquality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing\nfor diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as\nhigher-quality responses."}
