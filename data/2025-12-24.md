*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM框架利用变形艺术制作视角依赖的对抗样本，在无需模型访问的黑盒设置下攻击自动驾驶视觉系统，成功率超90%，并能通过V2X通信引发网络级破坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CAV系统依赖视觉DNN和V2X通信，但仍易受物理对抗攻击。现有攻击方法存在局限性，需要开发更隐蔽、可转移的攻击框架来揭示CAV系统的关键漏洞。

Method: 利用变形艺术原理制作视角依赖的对抗样本，通过几何变形创建对人类自然但对检测器致命的图像。采用黑盒攻击策略，无需目标模型访问，测试了四种不同检测器架构的转移性。

Result: 在CARLA模拟中，PHANTOM在最佳条件下攻击成功率超过90%，在恶劣环境下仍保持60-80%效果。攻击在6-10米内激活，反应时间不足。V2X模拟显示虚假紧急信息传播使信息峰值年龄增加68-89%。

Conclusion: PHANTOM框架揭示了CAV生态系统在感知和通信层的严重漏洞，强调了需要更强大的防御机制来应对物理对抗威胁，确保自动驾驶系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

TL;DR: 利用预训练视频扩散模型从单张运动模糊图像恢复完整视频序列，揭示拍摄时刻前后的场景动态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊图像虽然模糊了细节，但编码了曝光期间场景和相机运动的信息。现有方法依赖手工先验或特定网络架构，难以恢复复杂场景动态，且无法重建拍摄前后的内容。

Method: 提出新方法，利用在互联网规模数据集上预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张运动模糊图像恢复视频序列，揭示拍摄时刻及前后的复杂场景动态。

Result: 方法优于现有技术，能泛化到具有挑战性的真实世界图像，支持恢复相机轨迹、物体运动和动态3D场景结构等下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过重新利用预训练视频扩散模型，能够从单张运动模糊图像中恢复复杂的场景动态，包括拍摄前后的内容，为运动模糊图像分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

TL;DR: 提出使用视频扩散模型从单张失焦图像生成感知准确的焦点堆栈，实现逼真的后捕捉重新对焦


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动对焦系统经常无法捕捉预期主体，用户希望能在拍摄后调整焦点，但现有方法效果有限

Method: 使用视频扩散模型从单张失焦图像生成焦点堆栈（表示为视频序列），并发布大规模真实世界智能手机焦点堆栈数据集

Result: 在感知质量和鲁棒性方面一致优于现有方法，支持交互式重新对焦和多种下游应用

Conclusion: 该方法为日常摄影中更先进的焦点编辑功能铺平了道路，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了几何模型拟合中的评分函数问题，分析了MAGSAC++方法的理论基础，并提出了新的实验评估方法，发现现有评分函数性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RANSAC中几何模型拟合的评分函数问题，特别是分析当前表现最佳的MAGSAC++方法的理论基础，并建立系统的评估框架。

Method: 1. 扩展几何误差到球形噪声模型；2. 建立包含均匀分布异常值的混合模型；3. 分析MAGSAC++的理论推导问题；4. 提出基于大验证集或小随机验证集的实验评估方法。

Result: 1. 发现MAGSAC++的推导不符合合理原则，其评分函数在数值上等价于简单的高斯-均匀似然模型；2. 所有评分函数（包括学习的内点分布）在实验中表现相同；3. MAGSAC++既不优于简单竞争者，也不对阈值超参数选择更不敏感。

Conclusion: 本文全面重新审视了当前最先进的几何模型评分方法，为未来改进方法或应用于其他鲁棒拟合问题提供了重要参考，揭示了现有方法的理论局限性和实际性能相当性。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ：一种利用3D高斯和边缘先验的混合视图变换分支，提升3D全景占据预测的几何一致性和边界感知能力的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D全景占据预测方法在保持精确几何结构和捕捉3D实例空间范围方面存在困难，这影响了全景分离的鲁棒性。需要提升几何一致性和边界感知能力。

Method: 提出HyGE-Occ框架，采用混合视图变换分支：融合连续高斯深度表示和离散深度仓表示，生成几何一致性更好的BEV特征；同时从BEV特征提取边缘图作为辅助信息学习边缘线索。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上的广泛实验表明，HyGE-Occ优于现有工作，展现出卓越的3D几何推理能力。

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ通过混合视图变换分支结合3D高斯和边缘先验，有效提升了3D全景占据预测的几何一致性和边界感知，实现了更好的3D场景理解。

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Widget2Code任务，针对紧凑、无上下文的小部件UI生成代码，开发了包含感知理解和结构化代码生成的基线系统WidgetFactory，显著提升视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code研究主要关注网页和移动界面，而小部件（widget）作为紧凑、无上下文的微界面，具有密集布局和图标化特点，且缺乏可访问的标记数据，需要专门研究。

Method: 1) 建立仅图像的widget基准和细粒度评估指标；2) 开发联合感知理解和结构化代码生成的基线：遵循widget设计原则组装原子组件，包含图标检索和可重用可视化模块；3) 设计端到端基础设施WidgetFactory，包括框架无关的WidgetDSL和可编译为多种前端实现的编译器；4) 自适应渲染模块优化空间维度以满足紧凑性约束。

Result: 基准测试显示通用多模态大语言模型优于专用UI2Code方法，但仍产生不可靠和视觉不一致的代码。提出的WidgetFactory基线系统显著提升了视觉保真度，为未来Widget2Code研究建立了强基准和统一基础设施。

Conclusion: Widget2Code是一个重要但未充分探索的研究方向，提出的基准和WidgetFactory系统为小部件UI代码生成提供了有效的解决方案，建立了未来研究的坚实基础。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign是一个深度学习框架，通过统一的体积-表面表示联合配准3D脑MRI图像，在球面坐标空间中实现皮层和皮层下区域的一致对齐，显著提高配准精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将脑MRI的体积配准和表面配准分开处理，导致不一致性，限制了神经科学研究的跨被试分析。需要一种能够同时对齐皮层和皮层下区域的统一方法。

Method: 提出NeurAlign深度学习框架，使用中间球面坐标空间将解剖表面拓扑与体积解剖结构连接起来，通过集成球面配准到学习过程中，确保体积和表面域之间的几何一致性。

Result: 在域内和域外数据集上，NeurAlign始终优于传统和基于机器学习的配准方法，将Dice分数提高了最多7个点，同时保持规则的变形场。推理速度比标准方法快几个数量级，且仅需MRI扫描作为输入。

Conclusion: NeurAlign凭借其卓越的准确性、快速推理和易用性，为联合皮层和皮层下配准设定了新标准，解决了传统方法的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

*Wentao Wu,Xiao Wang,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2是一个车辆中心预训练大模型，通过引入车辆对称性、轮廓和语义三种结构化先验来增强掩码令牌重建，提升车辆感知的表征学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预训练阶段缺乏对车辆相关知识的有效学习，导致车辆感知表征建模能力不足，需要开发专门的车辆中心预训练模型。

Method: 提出VehicleMAE-V2模型，设计三个模块：对称性引导掩码模块（SMM）利用车辆对称性选择高质量掩码图像块；轮廓引导表征模块（CRM）通过最小化轮廓特征与重建特征的概率分布差异来保留整体结构信息；语义引导表征模块（SRM）通过对比学习和跨模态蒸馏对齐图像-文本特征。构建了包含400万车辆图像和12,693文本描述的大规模数据集Autobot4M。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的广泛实验证明了VehicleMAE-V2的优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过探索和利用车辆相关的多模态结构化先验来指导掩码令牌重建过程，可以显著增强模型学习车辆中心感知可泛化表征的能力。

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

### [9] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH)，认为训练好的ViT具有块循环深度结构，可以用k≪L个不同块循环应用来准确重写原始L块计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ViT成为标准视觉骨干网络，需要对其计算现象学进行机制性解释。尽管架构线索暗示了动态结构，但缺乏将Transformer深度解释为特征化流的框架。

Method: 引入BRH假设，通过层间表示相似性矩阵分析ViT的连续阶段，训练块循环替代模型Raptor来验证假设，并开发动态可解释性程序。

Result: 小规模实验显示随机深度和训练促进循环结构；Raptor模型仅用2个块恢复DINOv2 ImageNet-1k线性探测96%准确率；发现方向收敛、token特定动态和低秩更新等动态特性。

Conclusion: ViT深度中出现了紧凑的循环程序，指向低复杂度规范解，使这些模型能够通过原则性动力系统分析进行研究。

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360：用于360°全景图多条件引导物体编辑的新框架，通过粗到精的自主数据生成和两阶段数据优化策略，训练基于Transformer的扩散模型实现高质量编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑方法扩展到360°全景图时面临挑战，在等距柱状投影和透视视图中常产生不合理结果，需要专门解决全景图编辑问题的方案。

Method: 1）提出粗到精的自主数据生成流程，利用视觉语言模型和自适应投影调整进行分层分析；2）引入两阶段数据优化策略提升数据真实性和减少伪影；3）基于构建的数据集训练基于Transformer的扩散模型，支持文本、掩码或参考图像等多种条件引导的编辑。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视觉质量和语义准确性方面均优于现有方法，能够生成语义有意义且几何一致的全景图编辑结果。

Conclusion: SE360框架通过创新的数据生成和优化策略，成功解决了360°全景图编辑的挑战，实现了高质量、多条件引导的物体编辑，为全景图编辑领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建可扩展的3D模型提供了有价值的观察，视频基础模型在3D理解方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS是一个计算框架，通过整合30个拓扑和空间特征来量化组织微结构，并采用大规模单变量回归将组织空间组织与临床结果关联起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏能够测量个体结构特征空间相互作用及其与临床参数关联的工具，限制了全切片图像中组织特征在微环境和宏观环境层面的临床相关性研究。

Method: 1) 构建特征空间：在传统指标基础上增加30个来自地理信息系统点模式分析的拓扑和空间特征；2) 关联研究引擎：采用类似表型全关联研究的方法，对每个特征进行大规模单变量回归并进行统计校正。

Result: 在肾脏精准医学项目的385张PAS染色全切片图像上应用HistoWAS，分析了102个特征（72个传统对象级特征和30个空间特征），代码和数据已开源。

Conclusion: HistoWAS框架能够有效连接组织空间组织与临床结果，为组织病理学分析提供了新的计算工具，有助于生物标志物发现和组织特征研究。

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

### [13] [WSD-MIL: Window Scale Decay Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19982)
*Le Feng,Li Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WSD-MIL方法，通过窗口尺度衰减注意力模块和区域门控模块，在降低62%计算内存的同时，在CAMELYON16和TCGA-BRCA数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法主要关注特征提取器和聚合策略，忽略了WSI中实例间的复杂语义关系。基于Transformer的MIL方法虽然试图建模实例依赖，但二次计算复杂度限制了其在大规模WSI上的可扩展性。此外，由于不同WSI中肿瘤区域尺度变化显著，现有固定尺度注意力机制难以精确捕捉局部实例相关性，且未考虑基于距离的补丁相关性衰减效应。

Method: 提出WSD-MIL方法，包含两个核心模块：1) 窗口尺度衰减注意力模块：采用基于聚类的采样策略降低计算成本，同时逐步衰减注意力窗口尺度以在不同尺度上捕捉局部实例关系；2) 基于挤压-激励的区域门控模块：动态调整窗口权重以增强全局信息建模。

Result: 在CAMELYON16和TCGA-BRCA数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时减少了62%的计算内存消耗。

Conclusion: WSD-MIL通过创新的窗口尺度衰减注意力机制和区域门控模块，有效解决了现有Transformer-based MIL方法在计算效率和多尺度肿瘤区域建模方面的局限性，为计算病理学中的WSI分析提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

TL;DR: DDTM：一种双分支弱监督框架，通过扩散分支细化局部语义和Transformer分支保持全局上下文一致性，解决跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中的分辨率不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨分辨率土地覆盖映射需要从粗分辨率监督中生成高分辨率语义预测，但严重的分辨率不匹配导致现有弱监督方法难以对齐细粒度空间结构与粗标签，造成噪声监督和映射精度下降。

Method: 提出DDTM双分支弱监督框架：1）扩散分支逐步细化细尺度局部语义；2）Transformer分支强制大空间范围内的长距离上下文一致性；3）伪标签置信度评估模块缓解跨分辨率不一致性带来的噪声，选择性利用可靠监督信号。

Result: 在Chesapeake Bay基准测试中达到66.52% mIoU，显著优于现有弱监督方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DDTM通过解耦局部语义细化和全局上下文推理，有效解决了跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中的分辨率不匹配问题，为弱监督遥感图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: MIVA是一个轻量级模块化图像到视频适配器，通过并行扩展学习单一运动模式，只需少量样本训练即可实现精确运动控制，无需提示工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像动画应用受限，主要因为视频数据维度高导致训练数据稀缺，模型倾向于记忆而非遵循提示生成运动，且难以泛化到训练集中未见过的新运动模式。

Method: 提出MIVA模块化图像到视频适配器，作为预训练扩散模型的轻量子网络，每个模块设计用于捕获单一运动模式，可通过并行化扩展，仅需约10个样本在消费级GPU上高效训练。

Result: 实验表明MIVA能实现更精确的运动控制，同时保持甚至超越在更大数据集上训练模型的生成质量，用户可通过选择单个或多个MIVA模块指定运动而无需提示工程。

Conclusion: MIVA通过模块化设计解决了扩散模型在图像动画中的泛化问题，实现了高效的小样本运动模式学习，为精确运动控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Motivation: 当前模型只能处理简单的单目标指令，但在面对复杂地理空间场景时（如多粒度分割、多目标指令、隐含意图理解）表现不佳。现有数据集过于简化，导致实际应用中的模型敏感脆弱。

Method: 提出LaSeRS数据集，涵盖层次粒度、目标多样性、推理需求和语言变异性四个关键维度。设计SegEarth-R2架构，采用空间注意力监督机制处理小目标定位，以及灵活高效的分割查询机制处理单目标和多目标场景。

Conclusion: LaSeRS填补了现有数据集过于简化的关键空白，SegEarth-R2通过专门设计的架构解决了复杂地理空间场景的语言引导分割挑战，为灾害响应和环境监测等应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

TL;DR: 双视角（驾驶员+道路）输入在某些架构中能提升分心驾驶检测准确率，但效果取决于模型设计，不当融合反而会降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分心驾驶检测模型仅依赖驾驶员视角，忽略了影响驾驶行为的关键环境上下文。本研究探讨结合道路视角是否能提升自然驾驶条件下的检测准确率。

Method: 使用真实世界驾驶的双摄像头同步录像，在三种时空动作识别架构（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50）上对比单视角（仅驾驶员）和堆叠双视角输入配置。

Result: 单路径SlowOnly模型在双视角输入下准确率提升9.8%，而双路径SlowFast模型因表征冲突准确率下降7.2%。性能提升高度依赖底层架构设计。

Conclusion: 简单地添加视觉上下文并不足够，可能导致干扰，除非架构专门设计支持多视角融合。未来多模态驾驶员监控系统需要融合感知设计。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Method: 提出MAPI-GNN框架：1）通过多维判别器发现潜在图感知模式；2）基于这些模式动态构建激活图堆栈；3）通过关系融合引擎聚合和上下文化多面图配置文件进行诊断。

Result: 在两个不同任务（包含1300多个患者样本）上的实验表明，MAPI-GNN显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN通过从语义解缠特征子空间学习多面图配置文件，能够更好地建模患者特定的病理关系，为多模态医疗诊断提供了更有效的图神经网络方法。

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有CZSL方法在欧几里得空间中建模层次结构时，无法扩展到现实世界所需的大规模分类体系，因为欧几里得空间的体积多项式增长无法匹配层次结构的指数增长，限制了泛化能力

Method: 提出H2em框架：1）利用双曲几何嵌入树状结构；2）设计双层次蕴含损失，使用双曲蕴含锥强制预定义层次结构；3）设计判别对齐损失，通过困难负样本挖掘在语义相似组合间建立大地距离；4）设计双曲跨模态注意力实现实例感知的跨模态融合

Conclusion: 双曲几何为CZSL中的层次结构建模提供了自然空间，H2em框架通过精心设计的损失函数和注意力机制，有效解决了层次结构建模和细粒度判别问题，显著提升了组合零样本学习的性能

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin：一个两阶段框架，通过结合视觉特征、拼音标注和大语言模型来提升中文唇语识别性能，解决中文同音字和视觉相似性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 中文唇语识别面临两个主要挑战：1）视觉相似性高（visemes高度模糊），2）同音字普遍存在。现有方法在中文环境下性能有限，需要结合语音和语义信息来解决这些歧义问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用共享视频编码器和双解码器联合预测中文字符序列及其标准拼音标注；第二阶段利用大语言模型进行歧义消解，通过拼接拼音输出和候选文本序列构建提示，并针对模型特定错误模式进行微调。

Result: 通过多任务学习（字符和拼音）获得鲁棒的视觉-语义表示，结合大语言模型的语音上下文纠正同音字错误，并通过合成噪声数据微调使LLM能够识别模型特定错误模式，从而提升中文唇语识别性能。

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin通过协同整合视觉特征、语音上下文和语言模型，有效解决了中文唇语识别中的歧义问题，为中文视觉语音识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Motivation: 现有唇部同步系统通常需要复杂的掩码处理或使用GANs/扩散模型，导致计算开销大、推理速度慢。需要一种既能保持高质量视觉效果，又能实现实时性能的简单稳定方案。

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了激活函数和优化器组合对基于深度学习的HAR系统性能的影响，发现ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop在医疗相关活动识别中表现最佳，准确率可达99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在人类活动识别中广泛应用，但激活函数和优化器选择及其组合对性能的影响尚未得到充分分析，特别是在实际医疗场景中。现有研究多关注架构设计，而AF与MO的交互作用相对未被探索。

Method: 研究评估了三种激活函数（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh）与四种优化算法（SGD、Adam、RMSprop、Adagrad）的组合效果，使用两种循环深度学习架构（BiLSTM和ConvLSTM），在HMDB51和UCF101数据集的六个医疗相关活动类别上进行实验。

Result: ConvLSTM在所有实验中表现优于BiLSTM，特别是结合Adam或RMSprop时准确率可达99.00%。BiLSTM在UCF101上表现尚可（约98.00%），但在HMDB51上性能大幅下降至约60.00%，表明其跨数据集鲁棒性较差且对AF和MO变化不敏感。

Conclusion: 该研究为优化HAR系统提供了实用见解，特别是在需要快速精确活动检测的现实医疗环境中。ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop表现出强大的时空学习能力和稳定性能，是医疗相关HAR应用的推荐选择。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成LiDAR点云时难以同时实现高质量和多样化可控性，主要因为复杂的点云分布与简单控制信号之间的不平衡问题

Method: 将文本、图像和点云统一表示为3D布局，转换为语义和深度控制信号，然后使用基于rangemap的ControlNet指导LiDAR点云生成

Result: 像素级对齐方法在可控LiDAR点云生成中表现出色，支持从任意文本描述、图像和草图创建自动驾驶环境

Conclusion: LiDARDraft通过3D布局桥梁解决了控制信号与点云分布不平衡问题，实现了高质量、多样化可控的LiDAR点云生成，为自动驾驶仿真提供了新方法

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功统一了确定性和随机方法的优势，实现了高质量、快速的新颖视角合成，无需手工3D归纳偏置，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

Motivation: 现有基础设施检测技术存在局限性：探地雷达对水分和浅层缺陷敏感，热成像受天气影响且探测深度有限。单模态方法存在互补约束，需要融合多模态数据提高检测性能。

Method: 提出多模态注意力网络，包含：1) 雷达时间注意力处理时间模式；2) 热成像空间注意力提取空间特征；3) 跨模态融合通过可学习嵌入发现互补缺陷模式；4) 蒙特卡洛dropout和方差估计进行不确定性量化，分解为认知和偶然不确定性。

Conclusion: 注意力架构在典型场景表现良好，但极端类别不平衡时易受多数类主导。系统保持部署效率，支持实时检测，并提供能力与局限性的明确表征。

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Motivation: 现有音频-视觉分割方法存在多源纠缠和视听错位问题，导致偏向更大或更响的物体，而忽略较弱、较小或共现的声源。

Method: 使用可学习查询提取音频语义，通过音频原型记忆库构建结构化语义空间，结合对比学习增强区分性；引入延迟模态交互的双重交叉注意力机制改善多模态对齐。

Result: 在AVS-Objects和VPO基准测试中持续优于现有方法，在单源、多源和多实例场景中均表现出色。

Conclusion: DDAVS框架有效解决了音频-视觉分割中的关键挑战，展示了在复杂真实场景下的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Motivation: 现有文档图像检索方法主要基于图像查询，只能检索粗粒度语义类别（如报纸、收据），无法有效处理现实场景中通常提供的具有细粒度语义的文本查询

Method: 构建NL-DIR数据集（41K真实文档图像，每张配5个高质量细粒度语义查询），使用大语言模型生成并人工验证查询；评估现有对比视觉语言模型和OCR-free视觉文档理解模型的零样本和微调性能；研究两阶段检索方法提升性能同时保证时空效率

Conclusion: NL-DIR基准为视觉文档理解社区带来新机遇，促进文档图像检索研究从粗粒度类别检索向细粒度语义检索发展

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

TL;DR: HEART-ViT：首个基于Hessian引导的统一动态注意力与token剪枝框架，通过二阶曲率加权敏感度分析，在保持精度的同时显著降低ViT计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然精度领先，但其二次注意力成本和冗余计算严重阻碍在延迟和资源受限平台上的部署。现有剪枝方法孤立处理token或注意力头，依赖启发式或一阶信号，往往牺牲精度或无法跨输入泛化。

Method: 提出HEART-ViT框架，使用高效的Hessian-向量积估计token和注意力头的曲率加权敏感度，在明确损失预算下实现原则性剪枝决策。该双视角敏感度分析揭示：token剪枝主导计算节省，注意力头剪枝提供细粒度冗余移除，两者结合实现更优权衡。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上，使用ViT-B/16和DeiT-B/16，HEART-ViT实现高达49.4%的FLOPs减少、36%延迟降低和46%吞吐量提升，同时微调后保持或超越基线精度（如40% token剪枝下恢复4.7%精度）。在AGX Orin等边缘设备上部署验证了实际推理速度和能效提升。

Conclusion: HEART-ViT填补了理论与实践的差距，提供了首个统一、曲率驱动的剪枝框架，既保持精度又实现边缘高效，为ViT在资源受限平台上的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化任务面临环境变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，传统苹果姿态估计方法依赖关键点标注，但苹果的花萼等关键点常被遮挡，导致标注困难且耗时，且不同图像间存在冲突和缺失标注。

Method: 提出一个新颖流程：1) 使用3D高斯泼溅重建果园场景；2) 简化标注过程；3) 自动将标注投影到图像；4) 训练和评估姿态估计方法。仅需105个手动标注即可获得28,191个训练标签。

Result: 训练使用遮挡≤95%的苹果标签效果最佳，在原始图像上F1分数达0.927，渲染图像上达0.970。训练集大小对模型性能影响较小。遮挡最少的水果位置估计最好，但测试的姿态估计方法无法正确学习苹果的方向估计。

Conclusion: 提出的3D重建流程能大幅减少手动标注工作量（减少99.6%），有效解决果园环境中苹果姿态估计的标注挑战，但方向估计仍需改进。

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

Conclusion: CoDi首次将潜在扩散模型应用于低样本目标计数，通过示例条件化机制有效解决了密集小目标场景下的计数和定位问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Motivation: 传统像素空间变换编码在低比特率下难以同时实现高真实感和高保真度，因为像素失真与人类感知不一致。需要寻找更符合感知的压缩空间。

Method: 提出生成式潜在编码(GLC)架构：1)在VQ-VAE的潜在空间进行变换编码；2)引入分类超模块降低超信息比特成本；3)基于代码预测的监督增强语义一致性。

Result: 在自然图像上小于0.04bpp，人脸图像上小于0.01bpp时仍保持高视觉质量。在CLIC2020测试集上，以45%更少的比特达到与MS-ILLM相同的FID分数。

Conclusion: 生成式潜在空间具有更好的稀疏性、语义丰富性和感知对齐性，是实现高真实感、高保真度压缩的有效方案，并能支持图像修复和风格迁移等应用。

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits.

TL;DR: 提出JDPNet网络，通过联合特征挖掘模块和概率引导分布策略，统一处理水下图像中的耦合退化问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在多种退化类型，这些退化呈现非线性耦合而非简单叠加，现有方法大多针对特定退化设计分支或模块，难以有效捕捉和处理多退化间的非线性交互作用。

Method: 提出JDPNet网络，包含：1）联合特征挖掘模块和概率引导分布策略，用于挖掘和统一调整耦合退化特征；2）AquaBalanceLoss损失函数，平衡颜色、清晰度和对比度的多耦合退化损失。

Result: 在6个公开水下数据集和2个新建数据集上的实验表明，JDPNet在性能、参数量和计算成本之间取得更好平衡，展现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: JDPNet通过挖掘耦合退化中的潜在信息，在统一框架中有效处理水下图像的多退化问题，为水下图像增强提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

TL;DR: LiteFusion：一种新型多模态3D检测器，将LiDAR作为几何信息补充源而非独立模态，消除对3D稀疏卷积的依赖，提升部署友好性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态3D检测器过度依赖LiDAR传感器，在LiDAR缺失时性能大幅下降，且依赖GPU优化的3D稀疏卷积算子，难以在NPU/FPGA等多样化硬件平台部署，影响自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性和安全性

Method: 重新思考LiDAR在相机-LiDAR融合范式中的角色，将LiDAR点云作为几何信息补充源而非独立模态，在四元数空间中整合LiDAR点到图像特征，保持正交约束以建模跨模态领域特定关系，生成紧凑的跨模态嵌入

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，LiteFusion将基于视觉的基线检测器提升+20.4% mAP和+19.7% NDS，参数仅增加1.1%，无需专用LiDAR编码器。即使LiDAR输入缺失，仍能保持良好性能

Conclusion: LiteFusion通过重新定义LiDAR的角色，消除了对3D主干网络的依赖，实现了部署友好、鲁棒性强的多模态3D检测，在多样化融合范式和部署场景中表现出色

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: IndicDLP是一个大规模多语言文档布局数据集，涵盖11种印度语言和英语，解决现有数据集在细粒度标注、多语言覆盖和规模方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档布局分析数据集存在三个主要问题：1) PubLayNet和DocBank缺乏细粒度区域标签和多语言多样性；2) M6Doc和D4LA等人工标注数据集规模太小且多语言覆盖不足；3) 印度语言文档在现有数据集中代表性不足，限制了文档理解技术的发展。

Method: 1) 创建IndicDLP数据集，涵盖11种代表性印度语言和英语，覆盖12个常见文档领域；2) 从DocLayNet和M6Doc中整理UED-mini数据集用于预训练；3) 在IndicDLP上微调现有英语模型，验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明：1) 在IndicDLP上微调的现有英语模型性能显著提升；2) 在IndicDLP上训练的模型能够很好地泛化到非印度语言文档布局；3) IndicDLP成为文档数字化的重要资源。

Conclusion: IndicDLP填补了文档布局数据集在规模、多样性和标注粒度方面的空白，推动了包容性和高效的文档理解技术发展，特别为印度语言文档数字化提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一高光谱图像恢复方法依赖难以获取的显式退化先验（如退化标签），而真实场景中退化复杂且混合，需要更灵活的解决方案

Method: 设计空间-光谱退化度量来连续量化多维度退化作为退化提示；引入空间-光谱自适应模块动态调制特征提取；将SSAM作为专家集成到混合专家架构中，用退化提示作为门控路由器

Result: 在自然和遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，DAMP达到最先进性能，并展现出卓越的泛化能力

Conclusion: DAMP框架通过退化感知度量提示，无需依赖预定义退化先验，实现了对多样、混合或未见退化的自适应、高效和鲁棒恢复

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

TL;DR: LADLE-MM是一种基于模型汤初始化的多模态虚假信息检测器，在有限标注数据和训练资源下，通过结合单模态分支和多模态分支，使用BLIP提取的固定参考空间嵌入，以较少的可训练参数实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成和操纵多媒体内容的工具日益普及，现实主义的合成数字媒体篡改已成为广泛威胁，经常涉及跨多模态的同时操纵。这些技术被越来越多地用于扭曲重要事件的叙述和在社交媒体上传播虚假信息，促使了虚假信息检测器的发展。现有方法通常依赖计算密集型架构或需要大量标注数据。

Method: LADLE-MM采用模型汤初始化，包含两个单模态分支和一个多模态分支。多模态分支使用BLIP提取的固定多模态嵌入作为参考空间来增强图像和文本表示。该方法设计用于有限标注设置和受限训练资源，相比先前最先进模型减少了60.3%的可训练参数。

Result: 在DGM4基准测试中，LADLE-MM在二元和多标签分类任务上实现了竞争性性能，在没有基础标注的情况下优于现有方法。在VERITE数据集上，LADLE-MM超越了使用更复杂大型视觉语言模型架构的当前最先进方法，展示了在开放集设置中的有效泛化能力和对单模态偏见的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LADLE-MM证明了在有限标注设置下，通过精心设计的架构和固定参考空间嵌入，可以开发出高效且有效的多模态虚假信息检测器，即使使用较少的可训练参数也能实现竞争性性能，并具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

Motivation: 现有弱监督伪装目标检测方法存在两个主要问题：1) 通用分割模型生成的伪标签不可靠，缺乏任务特定语义理解；2) 忽略涂鸦标注的固有偏差，阻碍模型捕捉伪装目标的全局结构。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用自适应熵驱动点采样和多智能体辩论机制增强SAM在COD任务中的能力；第二阶段设计FADeNet，渐进融合多级频率感知特征，动态重加权监督强度以缓解标注偏差。

Result: D³ETOR显著缩小了弱监督与全监督COD之间的性能差距，在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合伪标签和涂鸦语义的监督信号，提出的两阶段框架有效解决了弱监督伪装目标检测中的关键挑战，为弱监督COD提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像领域广泛应用，但复杂模型（如ResNets、Vision Transformers）的解释性差。SHAP作为主流解释方法，在存在认知和随机不确定性时不稳定不可靠，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 使用Dirichlet后验采样和Dempster-Shafer理论，结合信念图、似然图和融合图方法，通过统计定量分析来量化SHAP解释中的不确定性。

Result: 在三个具有不同类别分布、图像质量和模态类型的医学影像数据集（病理学、眼科学、放射学）上评估了该框架，这些数据集引入了显著的认知不确定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效量化医学影像应用中SHAP解释的不确定性，为解决深度学习模型解释的可靠性问题提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散变换器的视频虚拟试穿方法存在三个主要问题：1) 难以捕捉细粒度服装动态细节；2) 无法保持视频帧间背景完整性；3) 由于引入额外交互模块导致计算成本高，且现有公开数据集规模和质量有限限制了模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出KeyTailor框架，核心是关键帧驱动的细节注入策略。首先采用指令引导的关键帧采样策略从输入视频中筛选信息丰富的关键帧；然后使用两个定制模块：服装细节增强模块（提取服装动态到服装相关潜在空间）和协作背景优化模块（优化背景完整性），两者都以关键帧为指导；最后将这些丰富细节与姿态、掩码和噪声潜在一起注入标准扩散变换器块中。

Result: 实验表明，KeyTailor在动态和静态场景下，在服装保真度和背景完整性方面均优于现有最先进基线方法。同时避免了扩散变换器架构的显式修改，减少了额外复杂性。

Conclusion: KeyTailor通过关键帧驱动的细节注入策略，有效解决了视频虚拟试穿中的服装动态细节捕捉和背景一致性问题，配合高质量数据集ViT-HD，实现了高效且逼真的试穿视频合成。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个无需训练、模型无关的框架，通过结构化推理和多轮验证来提升文本到图像生成的质量，特别适合轻量级生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时优化方法通常依赖隐式、整体的批评或无约束的提示重写，导致行为难以解释、控制或可靠停止。相比之下，大语言模型受益于基于验证、针对性修正和提前停止的结构化思维形式。

Method: CRAFT将提示分解为依赖结构化的视觉问题，使用视觉语言模型验证生成的图像，通过LLM智能体在约束失败时应用针对性提示编辑。该过程在满足所有约束条件后通过显式停止准则进行迭代，形成一个可解释且可控的推理时优化循环。

Result: 在多个模型系列和具有挑战性的基准测试中，CRAFT持续提升了组合准确性、文本渲染和基于偏好的评估，对轻量级生成器的提升尤为显著。这些改进仅带来可忽略的推理时间开销，使较小或较便宜的模型能够接近更昂贵系统的质量。

Conclusion: 显式结构化、约束驱动的推理时推理是提高多模态生成模型可靠性的关键因素，CRAFT框架为此提供了一种有效的实现方式。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DETACH框架，通过分解时空特征解决外中心视频与环境传感器对齐问题，相比传统全局对齐方法能更好捕捉局部细节和语义上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于穿戴传感器的自我中心视频对齐方法存在用户不适、隐私问题和可扩展性限制。外中心视频与环境传感器作为非侵入式替代方案，但传统全局对齐方法无法捕捉局部细节，且过度依赖模态不变的时间模式，导致不同时空语义上下文但相似时间模式的动作被错误对齐。

Method: 提出DETACH分解时空框架：1）显式分解时空特征以保留局部细节；2）通过在线聚类发现传感器-空间特征提供语义基础；3）两阶段对齐：先通过相互监督建立空间对应，再通过空间-时间加权对比损失进行时间对齐，自适应处理简单负样本、困难负样本和假负样本。

Result: 在Opportunity++和HWU-USP数据集的下游任务实验中，相比适应的自我中心-穿戴传感器基线方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: DETACH框架有效解决了外中心视频与环境传感器对齐中的局部细节捕捉和语义上下文问题，为非侵入式、可扩展的人类动作识别提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在视频监控中存在对正常情况的固有偏置，难以有效检测犯罪异常；而链式思维推理策略缺乏异常归纳偏置，进一步导致模型偏向正常解释

Method: 提出Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT)多智能体推理框架，在推理过程中通过最终的异常聚焦分类层引入归纳犯罪偏置

Result: 在低分辨率视频中异常检测F1分数提升11.8个百分点，在高分辨率视频中异常分类提升3.78个百分点

Conclusion: CoAT框架通过引入异常偏置有效解决了大型视觉语言模型在视频监控中的正常性偏置问题，显著提升了异常检测和分类性能

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉的运动理解方法大多忽略了关节驱动力等物理线索，而这些在生物力学中是基础要素。研究旨在探索物理推断力是否以及何时能增强运动理解能力。

Method: 将物理推断力整合到现有的运动理解流程中，系统评估其在步态识别、动作识别和细粒度视频描述三大任务上的影响，使用基线模型在8个基准数据集上进行测试。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，引入力特征均带来一致性能提升：CASIA-B步态识别Rank-1准确率从89.52%提升至90.39%（+0.87%），在穿外套和侧视等挑战条件下提升更大（+2.7%和+3.0%）；Gait3D从46.0%提升至47.3%（+1.3%）；Penn Action动作识别提升+2.00%，高用力类别如拳击/拍打提升+6.96%；视频描述任务中ROUGE-L从0.310提升至0.339（+0.029）。

Conclusion: 物理推断力线索能显著补充视觉和运动学特征，在动态、遮挡或外观变化条件下尤其有效，为运动理解提供了有价值的物理维度。

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.
  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.

TL;DR: SirenPose：一种结合周期性激活网络与关键点几何监督的几何感知损失函数，用于从单目视频中准确、时序一致地重建动态3D场景，在快速运动、多物体交互等挑战性场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理快速运动、多物体交互、遮挡和快速场景变化等挑战性场景时，往往难以保持运动保真度和时空一致性。需要一种能够同时保证几何精度和时序连贯性的动态3D场景重建方法。

Method: 1. 结合正弦表示网络的周期性激活特性与基于关键点的几何监督，形成几何感知损失函数；2. 引入物理启发的约束来增强空间和时间维度上的关键点预测一致性；3. 利用高频信号建模捕捉细粒度几何细节；4. 扩展UniKPT数据集至60万标注实例；5. 集成图神经网络建模关键点关系和结构相关性。

Result: 在Sintel、Bonn和DAVIS等基准测试中均优于现有方法：在DAVIS上，FVD降低17.8%，FID降低28.7%，LPIPS提升6.0%；时序一致性、几何精度、用户评分和运动平滑度均有改善；在姿态估计上优于Monst3R，绝对轨迹误差、平移和旋转相对姿态误差均更低。

Conclusion: SirenPose通过整合周期性激活网络、几何监督和物理约束，有效解决了动态3D场景重建中的时序一致性和几何精度问题，特别擅长处理快速运动、复杂动力学和物理合理重建等挑战性场景。

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

Motivation: 单视角RGB方法存在深度模糊、遮挡和杂乱问题，而现有多视角方法要么依赖精确的单视角估计，要么缺乏对未见物体的泛化能力。需要一种能聚合多视角信息且具有良好泛化性的方法。

Conclusion: AlignPose通过多视角特征度量优化有效解决了单视角方法的局限性，在保持泛化能力的同时显著提升了姿态估计精度，特别适用于工业场景。

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

Motivation: 传统图像融合方法在处理动态范围和焦点深度差异时存在局限，现有文本引导方法仅使用粗粒度描述，难以理解细粒度细节并实现精确的跨模态对齐。

Method: 提出MTIF框架：1) 引入多粒度文本描述（细节、结构、语义）；2) 分层跨模态调制模块；3) 各粒度监督信号促进视觉-文本对齐；4) 显著性驱动增强模块丰富训练数据。

Conclusion: 多粒度文本描述和分层跨模态调制能显著提升图像融合质量，为文本引导的图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在通用理解方面表现出色，但在动态空间推理（DSR）方面仍然较弱，即推理3D空间中物体几何和关系随时间演变的能力。这主要是由于缺乏可扩展的4D感知训练资源。

Method: 1) 提出自动化流水线，从野外视频生成DSR的多选题对；2) 利用现代视觉基础模型提取丰富的几何和运动信息；3) 构建DSR-Train用于学习和人工精炼的DSR-Bench用于评估；4) 提出轻量级几何选择模块(GSM)，将几何先验集成到VLM中。

Result: 将DSR-Train和GSM集成到Qwen2.5-VL-7B中，显著增强了其动态空间推理能力，同时在通用视频理解基准上保持了准确性。

Conclusion: DSR Suite通过数据集、基准和模型的综合解决方案，有效解决了视觉语言模型在动态空间推理方面的不足，为4D感知推理提供了系统性的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM是一个文本引导的视觉token选择框架，通过计算图像token与文本嵌入的跨模态相似度，动态适应视觉输入到查询，实现高效压缩同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常处理大量视觉token，导致二次注意力成本和冗余。现有token减少方法常忽略文本查询或依赖不稳定的深度注意力图，在激进剪枝时导致语义对齐退化

Method: 提出文本引导的视觉token选择框架，计算投影图像token与归一化文本嵌入在语言模型空间中的显式跨模态相似度，将外部相关性与内在视觉显著性通过对数域加权和温度控制锐化融合，并保留最小但具代表性的背景token集以维持全局上下文

Result: 在相同token预算和评估协议下，FlashVLM实现超越无损压缩，在LLaVA 1.5上剪枝高达77.8%视觉token时略微超过未剪枝基线，在94.4%压缩率下仍保持92.8%准确率，在14个图像和视频基准测试中展示最先进的效率-性能权衡

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过文本引导的视觉token选择，在主流VLM中实现了卓越的效率-性能平衡，同时保持强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究模拟器中专家演示与学生观察之间的不对齐问题，提出改进方法使TransFuser v6在CARLA基准测试中达到新SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟器能生成无限驾驶数据，但模仿学习策略在模拟中仍难以实现鲁棒的闭环性能。研究发现特权专家演示与基于传感器的学生观察之间存在不对齐问题：专家具有更高可见性（忽略遮挡）和更低不确定性（知道其他车辆动作），且导航意图在测试时仅通过单个目标点指定，这些不对称性限制了模仿学习效果。

Method: 通过实际干预措施缩小专家与学生之间的差距：1）处理可见性不对齐；2）降低不确定性差异；3）改进导航意图指定方式。将感知监督集成到共享的模拟到真实管道中，开发TransFuser v6学生策略。

Result: TransFuser v6在CARLA所有主要公开闭环基准测试中达到新SOTA：Bench2Drive上95 DS，Longest6~v2和Town13上性能翻倍。在NAVSIM和Waymo视觉端到端驾驶基准测试中也显示出一致增益。

Conclusion: 专家与学生之间的不对齐问题显著限制模仿学习性能，通过针对性干预缩小这些差距能大幅提升驾驶性能。提出的方法在多个基准测试中验证有效，为模拟到真实驾驶提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

TL;DR: DiTracker：利用预训练视频扩散变换器（DiT）进行点跟踪的新方法，通过注意力匹配和轻量级微调，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ResNet等浅层卷积网络的方法处理视频帧时缺乏时间连贯性，在动态运动和频繁遮挡等挑战性条件下匹配不可靠。研究发现预训练的视频扩散变换器具有内在的点跟踪能力

Method: 提出DiTracker方法：1）查询-键注意力匹配机制；2）轻量级LoRA微调；3）与ResNet骨干网络进行成本融合。利用预训练视频DiT的时空注意力特性

Result: 在ITTO基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在TAP-Vid基准测试中匹配或超越SOTA模型。尽管使用8倍小的批量大小训练，仍表现出色

Conclusion: 验证了视频DiT特征作为点跟踪任务的有效且高效基础，为4D重建、机器人和视频编辑等应用提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

*Daewoon Kim,Si Young Yie,Jae Sung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPOD是一种用于优化联邦学习效率和通信成本的新方法，通过包含被排除的异常值参与者、消除对先前轮次学习信息的依赖，并应用每轮验证损失计算，在性能上与FedPIDAvg相当，同时与Kubernetes自动扩展兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedPIDAvg方法虽然通过PID控制器和泊松分布建模提高了性能并降低了通信成本，但存在两个主要问题：1) 基于泊松分布排除异常值参与者限制了数据利用；2) PID控制器需要在整个联邦学习过程中保持相同的参与者，因为它使用先前轮次的学习信息。FedPOD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FedPOD通过以下方式改进：1) 包含被排除为异常值的参与者；2) 消除对先前轮次学习信息的依赖；3) 应用每轮验证损失计算方法。该方法从Kubernetes的最小计算单元POD获得灵感，设计为与Kubernetes自动扩展兼容，允许将轮次任务扩展到POD单元，实现类似Kubernetes自动扩展的灵活设计。

Result: FedPOD在性能指标上与FedPIDAvg相当：Dice分数平均为WT 0.78、ET 0.71、TC 0.72，投影收敛分数平均为0.74。同时解决了FedPIDAvg的限制，提高了数据利用率和灵活性。

Conclusion: FedPOD展示了通过提高效率、灵活性和性能指标来增强联邦学习的潜力，特别是在包含异常值参与者、消除对历史信息的依赖以及与Kubernetes自动扩展兼容性方面具有优势。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了L-IVA基准和ORCA框架，使视频虚拟人具备主动智能和长期目标规划能力，通过内部世界模型和OTAR循环解决生成不确定性下的自主决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频虚拟人生成方法虽然能保持身份一致性和动作对齐，但缺乏真正的自主性，无法通过自适应环境交互来追求长期目标。需要从被动动画转向主动、目标导向的行为。

Method: 提出ORCA框架，包含两个关键创新：1) 闭环OTAR循环（观察-思考-行动-反思），在生成不确定性下保持鲁棒状态跟踪；2) 分层双系统架构，System 2进行战略推理和状态预测，System 1将抽象计划转换为具体的模型特定动作描述。将虚拟人控制建模为POMDP，实现连续信念更新和结果验证。

Result: ORCA在任务成功率和行为一致性方面显著优于开环和非反思基线，验证了基于内部世界模型的设计能够有效提升视频虚拟人的智能水平。

Conclusion: 通过引入L-IVA基准和ORCA框架，成功实现了视频虚拟人从被动动画到主动、目标导向行为的转变，为视频虚拟人智能的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SpatialTree框架，将多模态大语言模型的空间能力分为四个认知层次（感知→心理映射→模拟→智能体能力），并构建了首个能力中心的分层基准测试，揭示了不同层次间的转移动态和优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的空间能力研究缺乏系统性框架，大多数研究只关注有限的任务集，未能理解空间能力从感知到推理和交互的渐进发展层次。

Method: 1. 提出SpatialTree认知科学启发框架，将空间能力分为四个层次：低级感知(L1)、心理映射(L2)、模拟(L3)、智能体能力(L4)；2. 构建首个能力中心的分层基准测试，评估主流MLLMs在27个子能力上的表现；3. 通过有监督微调探索能力转移动态；4. 提出自动思考策略优化强化学习训练。

Result: 1. 评估显示清晰的层次结构：L1技能基本正交，而高级技能强相关，表明依赖性递增；2. 微调发现L1内存在负迁移，但从低到高级别存在强跨层次转移和协同效应；3. 朴素RL鼓励过度"思考"不可靠，会损害直觉感知；4. 提出的自动思考策略能抑制不必要的深思熟虑，使RL在所有层次上一致提升性能。

Conclusion: SpatialTree为理解和系统扩展MLLMs的空间能力提供了概念验证框架，揭示了空间能力的层次结构和优化策略，有助于推动多模态智能的认知发展。

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen是一种新的视频生成方法，通过在语义空间而非VAE潜在空间生成视频，实现更快的收敛和更高的计算效率，特别适用于生成长视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型通常在VAE潜在空间学习视频分布，然后通过VAE解码器映射到像素。这种方法虽然能生成高质量视频，但收敛速度慢，且在生成长视频时计算成本高。

Method: 采用两阶段生成过程：第一阶段，扩散模型在紧凑的语义空间中生成语义视频特征，定义视频的全局布局；第二阶段，另一个扩散模型基于这些语义特征生成VAE潜在表示，最终产生输出。

Result: 在语义空间生成相比VAE潜在空间收敛更快，方法在扩展到长视频生成时既有效又计算高效。大量实验表明SemanticGen能生成高质量视频，优于最先进方法和强基线。

Conclusion: SemanticGen通过在语义空间进行视频生成，解决了传统VAE潜在空间方法的收敛慢和计算成本高的问题，为高质量视频生成提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于从电子健康记录中提取结构化肿瘤学数据，在40万份临床笔记上达到平均F1分数0.93，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的非结构化笔记包含丰富的临床信息，但可靠提取结构化肿瘤学数据面临挑战：变异性大、专业术语多、文档格式不一致。手动提取准确但成本高不可扩展，现有自动化方法通常只处理狭窄场景，无法充分处理患者级别的信息合成。

Method: 提出一个智能体框架，将复杂的肿瘤学数据提取分解为模块化、自适应的任务。使用大型语言模型作为推理智能体，配备上下文敏感检索和迭代合成能力，从真实世界的肿瘤学笔记中全面提取结构化临床变量。

Result: 在包含40万份非结构化临床笔记和扫描PDF报告的大规模数据集上评估，涵盖2,250名癌症患者。平均F1分数达到0.93，103个肿瘤学特定临床变量中有100个超过0.85，关键变量（如生物标志物和药物）超过0.95。集成到数据整理工作流程中，直接人工批准率达到0.94，显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于LLM智能体的端到端、全面的大规模结构化肿瘤学数据提取应用，能够有效处理真实世界临床笔记的复杂性，为癌症治疗决策和研究提供可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在教育技术中广泛应用，了解其在未经大量定制的情况下对真实教育场景的解读能力至关重要，这有助于设定预期和建立基准。

Method: 比较了6个LLMs在真实课堂转录文本中分类教学指令的基线性能，评估了零样本、单样本和少样本三种典型提示方法。

Result: 零样本表现中等，少样本提示显著提升了最先进模型的性能，最佳配置达到Cohen's Kappa = 0.58。但性能改进不均匀，不同教学指令间差异大，高召回率常以增加误报为代价。

Conclusion: 基础模型在解读教学话语方面表现出有意义但有限的能力，提示设计有助于展现其能力，但无法消除根本的可靠性限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的反事实框架量化机器学习论文的修辞风格，发现愿景式修辞能显著预测引用和媒体关注度，且2023年后修辞强度因LLM写作辅助而急剧上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI领域对机器学习论文中的"炒作"现象日益关注，但难以区分修辞风格与实质内容。现有方法无法可靠地量化修辞风格，因为大胆语言可能源于强实证结果或仅是修辞手法。

Method: 提出反事实、基于LLM的框架：多个LLM修辞角色从相同实质内容生成反事实写作，LLM评委通过成对比较进行评估，使用Bradley-Terry模型聚合结果。应用于2017-2025年8,485篇ICLR投稿，生成超过250,000个反事实写作。

Result: 愿景式修辞能显著预测下游关注度（引用和媒体关注），即使控制同行评审评估后亦然。观察到2023年后修辞强度急剧上升，实证证据表明这主要由LLM写作辅助的采用驱动。框架可靠性通过角色选择鲁棒性和LLM判断与人工标注的高相关性得到验证。

Conclusion: LLM可作为测量和改进科学评估的工具，能够有效量化论文修辞风格，区分内容与风格，为科学传播和评估提供新方法。

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个结合随机微分方程和人格条件部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程的混合框架，用于模拟在线极化中的心理异质性，相比传统同质模型能更好地捕捉个体认知偏差与信息传播的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理的舆论动力学模型由于简单的同质性假设，无法捕捉驱动在线极化的心理异质性，这阻碍了对意识形态分歧如何被放大的机制性理解。

Method: 提出PRISM混合框架：使用随机微分方程(SDE)模拟连续情感演化，结合人格条件部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(PC-POMDP)处理离散决策。为多模态大语言模型代理分配基于MBTI的认知策略，并通过大规模社交媒体数据集的数据驱动先验进行初始化。

Result: PRISM在人格一致性方面显著优于标准的同质模型和Big Five基准模型，与人类真实数据更一致。该框架能有效复现理性抑制和情感共鸣等涌现现象。

Conclusion: PRISM为分析复杂社交媒体生态系统提供了一个强大的工具，能够更好地模拟心理异质性对在线极化的影响。

Abstract: Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) of opinion dynamics often fail to capture the psychological heterogeneity driving online polarization due to simplistic homogeneity assumptions. This limitation obscures the critical interplay between individual cognitive biases and information propagation, thereby hindering a mechanistic understanding of how ideological divides are amplified. To address this challenge, we introduce the Personality-Refracted Intelligent Simulation Model (PRISM), a hybrid framework coupling stochastic differential equations (SDE) for continuous emotional evolution with a personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision process (PC-POMDP) for discrete decision-making. In contrast to continuous trait approaches, PRISM assigns distinct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based cognitive policies to multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, initialized via data-driven priors from large-scale social media datasets. PRISM achieves superior personality consistency aligned with human ground truth, significantly outperforming standard homogeneous and Big Five benchmarks. This framework effectively replicates emergent phenomena such as rational suppression and affective resonance, offering a robust tool for analyzing complex social media ecosystems.

TL;DR: 该研究探索大语言模型在对话系统中的隐性语气偏见，通过可控对话合成与语气分类模型结合，发现即使中性提示生成的对话也存在系统性语气偏向，并开发了高精度分类器检测这些模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在对话系统中广泛应用，但其回应常带有微妙的语气偏见（如过度礼貌、欢快或谨慎），这些偏见会影响用户对信任、同理心和公平性的感知，需要系统性地检测和解决。

Method: 1. 创建两个合成对话数据集：一个由中性提示生成，另一个明确引导生成积极或消极语气；2. 使用预训练的DistilBERT模型进行弱监督标注；3. 训练多个分类器检测语气模式，采用集成模型方法。

Result: 1. 即使中性数据集也显示出一致的语气偏向，表明偏见源于模型底层对话风格；2. 集成模型达到最高0.92的宏观F1分数，证明语气偏见是系统性、可测量的；3. 该方法能有效识别对话AI中的语气偏见模式。

Conclusion: 大语言模型存在系统性语气偏见，这种偏见是可测量且相关的。通过可控对话合成与分类模型结合的方法，为设计公平可信的对话AI提供了有效工具，有助于识别和缓解语气偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

TL;DR: 提出ThinkARM框架，将LLM推理轨迹抽象为功能性推理步骤（分析、探索、实现、验证等），用于系统分析数学问题解决中的推理结构和动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型越来越多地展示推理轨迹，但其底层的认知结构和步骤难以通过表面统计识别和分析，需要更系统的分析框架。

Method: 采用Schoenfeld的Episode Theory作为归纳性中间尺度视角，提出ThinkARM框架，将推理轨迹抽象为功能性推理步骤，应用于不同模型的数学问题解决分析。

Result: 揭示了推理模型与非推理模型之间可复现的思维动态和结构差异，发现探索步骤是影响正确性的关键分支点，效率导向方法会选择性抑制评估反馈步骤而非均匀缩短响应。

Conclusion: 片段级表示使推理步骤显式化，能够系统分析现代语言模型中推理的结构、稳定性和变化方式，为理解模型认知过程提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

TL;DR: Memory-T1：基于强化学习的时间感知记忆选择框架，用于长对话时序推理，通过粗到细策略和三级奖励函数提升模型在噪声长对话中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文模型在处理长对话历史时，难以准确识别时间相关信息，导致时序推理性能显著下降。随着对话历史增长和噪声累积，这一问题更加突出。

Method: 提出Memory-T1框架：1）粗到细策略：先用时间和相关性过滤器将对话历史剪枝为候选集；2）RL智能体选择精确证据会话；3）三级奖励函数：答案准确性、证据基础、时间一致性（会话级和话语级时序对齐）

Result: 在Time-Dialog基准测试中，Memory-T1将7B模型提升至67.0%总体得分，创开源模型新SOTA，比14B基线高出10.2%。消融研究表明时间一致性和证据基础奖励共同贡献15.0%性能提升。在128k令牌长度下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memory-T1通过时间感知记忆选择和强化学习训练，有效解决了长对话时序推理中的噪声和时序模糊问题，在性能和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Memory-T1/

*Zuo Wang,Ye Yuan*

TL;DR: 提出TextGSL模型，通过构建多边类型文本图结合Transformer层，解决现有GNN文本分类方法无法充分捕捉词对多样结构信息和序列信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的文本分类方法存在两个主要局限：1) 未能充分考虑词对之间的多样结构信息（如共现、句法、语义关系）；2) 在文本图结构学习模块中忽略了序列信息，无法处理包含新词和新关系的文本。

Method: TextGSL模型：1) 为每个文本构建单文本级图，基于词对间多样关系建立不同边类型；2) 设计自适应多边消息传递范式来聚合词对间的多样结构信息；3) 通过集成Transformer层来捕捉文本数据的序列信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，TextGSL在准确率方面优于多个强基线模型。

Conclusion: TextGSL通过结合图结构学习和序列信息捕捉，能够学习更具判别性的文本表示，有效解决了现有GNN文本分类方法的局限性。

Abstract: Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出ABBEL框架，通过信念瓶颈压缩多步决策历史，用强化学习提升性能，在保持内存恒定同时超越完整上下文性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着序列决策任务长度增加，在上下文中保持完整交互历史变得计算上不切实际，需要一种方法来压缩历史信息同时维持决策性能

Method: 引入ABBEL框架：用自然语言信念状态（任务相关未知信息的摘要）替代长交互历史；每步先更新先验信念形成后验信念，仅基于后验选择动作；通过强化学习训练LLM生成和基于信念行动，采用信念质量评分和长度惩罚

Result: 在六个多样化多步环境中评估：ABBEL支持生成可解释信念且内存使用接近恒定；但瓶颈方法易受错误传播影响，性能低于完整上下文；RL训练后ABBEL性能超越完整上下文设置，同时使用更少内存

Conclusion: ABBEL框架通过信念瓶颈有效压缩多步交互历史，结合RL训练可超越完整上下文性能，提供可解释信念表示，为长序列决策任务提供高效解决方案

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

TL;DR: M³KG-RAG：一种多跳多模态知识图谱增强的检索增强生成方法，通过构建上下文丰富的多模态实体三元组和引入GRASP机制，提升多模态大语言模型在音频-视觉领域的推理深度和答案忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态RAG在音频-视觉领域面临两大挑战：1）现有多模态知识图谱（MMKGs）的模态覆盖有限且多跳连接不足；2）仅基于共享多模态嵌入空间的相似性检索，无法过滤无关或冗余知识。

Method: 提出M³KG-RAG框架：1）设计轻量级多智能体管道构建多跳MMKG（M³KG），包含上下文丰富的多模态实体三元组；2）引入GRASP机制，确保查询的精确实体接地，评估答案支持相关性，并修剪冗余上下文。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试上的广泛实验表明，M³KG-RAG显著提升了多模态大语言模型的多模态推理和接地能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M³KG-RAG通过构建多跳多模态知识图谱和引入GRASP机制，有效解决了音频-视觉领域多模态RAG的局限性，提升了模型的推理深度和答案忠实度。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.

Conclusion: EKA推进了迭代RAG系统的最新技术，阐明了结构化推理与高效探索在强化学习增强框架中的关键相互作用

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

Conclusion: RetroPrompt通过在提示学习中引入检索机制，平衡了记忆和泛化，提高了预训练基础模型在数据有限情况下的性能表现。

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

Motivation: 现有联合语音-文本模型面临三个关键挑战：1）语音标记（25Hz）与文本标记（~3Hz）的时间分辨率不匹配导致语义信息稀释；2）计算成本高；3）导致文本LLM知识的灾难性遗忘。需要解决这些限制以实现高效的语音交互。

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

Motivation: LLMs在代码审查、内容审核等任务中表现出色，但研究发现它们容易受到隐藏在输入数据中的对抗性指令攻击，导致偏离预期任务。在简历筛选等常见应用中，防御措施往往缺失。

Method: 1) 建立评估简历筛选漏洞的基准；2) 评估两种防御机制：基于提示的防御和提出的FIDS（通过分离检测外来指令）使用LoRA适配；3) 结合两种防御方法。

Result: 攻击成功率超过80%；基于提示的防御减少10.1%攻击但增加12.5%误拒率；FIDS减少15.4%攻击但增加10.4%误拒率；结合方法减少26.3%攻击，训练时防御在安全和效用保持方面优于推理时缓解。

Conclusion: LLMs在简历筛选等应用中存在对抗性指令攻击的严重漏洞，训练时防御（如FIDS）比推理时缓解措施更有效，需要开发更强大的防御机制来保护LLM应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text comprehension and generation, making them ideal for automated tasks like code review and content moderation. However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: AprielGuard是一个8B参数的安全防护模型，统一处理LLM的安全风险（毒性、偏见）和对抗威胁（提示注入、越狱），在多种基准测试中表现优于现有开源防护方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在对话和代理场景中的部署增加，保护其免受不安全或对抗性行为变得至关重要。现有防护工具通常将安全风险和对抗威胁视为独立问题，限制了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出AprielGuard模型，在单一分类和学习框架中统一处理安全维度。使用多样化的开放和合成数据进行训练，涵盖独立提示、多轮对话和代理工作流，并通过结构化推理轨迹增强可解释性。

Result: 在多个公共和专有基准测试中，AprielGuard在检测有害内容和对抗性操作方面表现出色，特别是在多步骤和推理密集型场景中，优于Llama-Guard和Granite Guardian等现有开源防护方案。

Conclusion: 通过发布该模型，旨在推进LLM可靠防护的透明和可重复研究，为统一处理安全风险和对抗威胁提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against unsafe or adversarial behavior is critical as they are increasingly deployed in conversational and agentic settings. Existing moderation tools often treat safety risks (e.g. toxicity, bias) and adversarial threats (e.g. prompt injections, jailbreaks) as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability. We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios. By releasing the model, we aim to advance transparent and reproducible research on reliable safeguards for LLMs.

TL;DR: LLM在精神病学自评估中表现出色，在诊断边缘型人格障碍方面超越人类专家，但对自恋型人格障碍存在严重诊断不足，存在可靠性和偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在精神病学自评估中的使用增加，需要评估其解释定性患者叙述的能力，特别是与心理健康专业人员的直接比较。

Method: 使用波兰语第一人称自传体叙述，对最先进的LLM（Gemini Pro模型）和心理健康专业人员进行边缘型人格障碍和自恋型人格障碍诊断的直接比较。

Result: Gemini Pro模型在总体诊断准确率上比人类专业人员高出21.91个百分点（65.48% vs 43.57%）。模型在BPD诊断上表现优异（F1=83.4），但在NPD诊断上严重不足（F1=6.7 vs 50.0），显示出对"自恋"这一价值负载术语的回避。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在解释复杂的第一人称临床数据方面能力很强，但仍存在关键的可靠性和偏见问题，特别是在处理价值负载的诊断标签时。

Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.

TL;DR: SpidR是一个自监督语音表示模型，通过掩码预测、自蒸馏和在线聚类训练，能高效学习包含丰富语音信息的表示，特别适合无文本语音语言建模，训练时间比HuBERT大幅缩短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言建模和语音表示学习的并行发展，直接从语音学习语言而无需文本中介成为可能，这需要从语音中直接提取语义表示。

Method: 在原始波形上使用掩码预测目标结合自蒸馏和在线聚类进行训练。学生模型的中间层学习预测来自教师模型中间层的分配，这种学习目标稳定了在线聚类过程，产生更高质量的码本。

Result: SpidR在下游语言建模基准测试（sWUGGY、sBLIMP、tSC）上优于wav2vec 2.0、HuBERT、WavLM和DinoSR；验证了语音单元质量指标（ABX、PNMI）与语言建模性能的相关性；相比HuBERT将预训练时间从一周缩短到一天。

Conclusion: SpidR是一个高效的自监督语音表示模型，特别适合无文本语音语言建模，通过改进的训练方法和高效代码库实现了显著的性能提升和训练时间缩短，已开源代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了BanglaRiddleEval基准测试，包含1,244个孟加拉语谜语，通过四个任务评估LLMs在低资源比喻推理方面的能力，发现当前模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在标准NLP基准上表现优异，但在比喻性、文化基础和低资源环境下的推理能力尚未充分探索，特别是在孟加拉语这样的低资源语言中。

Method: 使用基于LLM的流水线生成思维链解释、语义连贯的干扰项和细粒度歧义标注，在四种任务上评估开源和闭源模型的不同提示策略。

Result: 模型在生成式QA中达到中等语义重叠但正确率低，多选题准确率最高约56%（人类基线83%），歧义解决率在26%-68%之间，高质量解释仅限最强模型。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs能捕捉孟加拉语谜语推理的部分线索，但远未达到人类水平，BanglaRiddleEval成为低资源比喻推理的挑战性新基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning. All data, code, and evaluation scripts are available on GitHub: https://github.com/Labib1610/BanglaRiddleEval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统质性研究的编码者间一致性评估方法需要多人参与、耗时且一致性通常不高，需要更高效可靠的评估框架。

Method: 开发多视角验证框架，结合集成验证与双重可靠性指标（Cohen's Kappa用于编码者间一致性，余弦相似度用于语义一致性），支持可配置分析参数和自定义提示结构，提供跨JSON格式的共识主题提取。

Result: 在迷幻艺术治疗访谈文本上评估三个LLM，Gemini可靠性最高（κ=0.907，余弦相似度95.3%），GPT-4o和Claude次之，所有模型均达到高一致性（κ>0.80），成功提取共识主题。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助质性研究提供了可靠的方法学基础，通过透明可靠性指标、灵活配置和结构无关的共识提取，支持可靠的AI辅助质性研究。

Abstract: Qualitative research faces a critical reliability challenge: traditional inter-rater agreement methods require multiple human coders, are time-intensive, and often yield moderate consistency. We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($κ$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($κ= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($κ= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($κ= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($κ> 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes. Our open-source implementation provides researchers with transparent reliability metrics, flexible configuration, and structure-agnostic consensus extraction, establishing methodological foundations for reliable AI-assisted qualitative research.

TL;DR: 提出情感感知文本摘要框架，结合抽取式(TextRank)和生成式(UniLM)方法，将情感信号融入排名和生成过程，用于处理社交媒体等非结构化短文本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体、评论和论坛产生的非结构化数据快速增长，文本挖掘在信息系统(IS)中变得至关重要。现有摘要方法主要针对结构化新闻优化，难以处理嘈杂、非正式的用户生成内容。情感线索对品牌监控和市场分析等IS任务很关键，但很少有研究将情感建模集成到短文本摘要中

Method: 提出情感感知框架，扩展抽取式(TextRank)和生成式(UniLM)方法：1) 在TextRank中嵌入情感信号改进句子排名；2) 在UniLM生成过程中融入情感信息。这种双重设计能更好地捕捉情感细微差别和主题相关性

Result: 该框架能够生成简洁、情感丰富的摘要，提高了对情感细微差别和主题相关性的捕捉能力，增强了在动态在线环境中及时干预和战略决策的能力

Conclusion: 情感感知摘要框架能够有效处理社交媒体等非结构化短文本，生成情感丰富的摘要，为信息系统中的品牌监控、市场分析和战略决策提供更好的支持

Abstract: With the rapid growth of unstructured data from social media, reviews, and forums, text mining has become essential in Information Systems (IS) for extracting actionable insights. Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes. This dual design improves the capture of emotional nuances and thematic relevance, producing concise, sentiment-enriched summaries that enhance timely interventions and strategic decision-making in dynamic online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学术基准（如BrowseComp）无法满足现实世界对开放式深度研究的需求，需要更强的意图识别、长时程决策和跨源验证能力。同时中文领域缺乏深度研究的评估基准。

Method: 1. 提出基于原子能力的数据合成策略来增强规划和报告撰写能力；2. 采用从智能体中期训练到SFT和RL的渐进式训练路径；3. 引入清单式评判器提高鲁棒性；4. 建立中文深度研究评估基准ADR-Bench。

Result: Step-DeepResearch（32B）在Scale AI Research Rubrics上获得61.4%的分数。在ADR-Bench上显著优于同类模型，并与OpenAI、Gemini DeepResearch等闭源SOTA模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 精细的训练方法使中等规模模型能够以行业领先的成本效益实现专家级深度研究能力，填补了中文领域深度研究评估的空白。

Abstract: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于层重要性分数的简单高效方法，用于选择将预训练Transformer中的哪些softmax注意力层转换为线性注意力层，以提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预训练的softmax注意力Transformer蒸馏为混合架构（交替使用softmax和线性注意力层）是提高LLM推理效率的有效方法，无需昂贵的从头预训练。关键挑战是如何选择要转换的层。

Method: 1. 使用少量通用文本数据训练得到层重要性分数，基于此进行层选择；2. 采用RADLADS蒸馏流程：注意力权重转移、隐藏状态对齐、基于KL散度的分布匹配，最后进行少量微调。

Result: 该方法比现有层选择方法更有效，包括基于固定比例均匀交替线性注意力的启发式方法，以及依赖专门诊断数据集的复杂方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种简单高效的层选择方法，结合RADLADS蒸馏流程，能够有效将预训练Transformer转换为混合注意力架构，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gnosis：一种轻量级自感知机制，通过解码LLM内部状态（隐藏状态和注意力模式）来预测自身生成错误，无需外部监督，仅增加约500万参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽然能生成流畅复杂的输出，但经常无法识别自己的错误和幻觉。现有方法依赖外部评估器、多样本一致性或基于文本的自我批评，这些方法要么增加额外计算成本，要么与真实正确性弱相关。因此需要一种能通过检查推理过程中的内部状态来预测自身失败的方法。

Method: 提出Gnosis机制：1）被动观察冻结LLM的内部痕迹（隐藏状态和注意力模式）；2）将其压缩为固定预算的描述符；3）预测正确性，推理成本可忽略，仅增加约500万参数，且独立于序列长度。

Result: 在数学推理、开放域问答和学术知识基准测试中，在1.7B到20B参数的冻结骨干模型上，Gnosis在准确性和校准方面持续优于强大的内部基线和大型外部评估器。还能零样本泛化到部分生成，实现早期失败轨迹检测和计算感知控制。

Conclusion: 可靠的正确性线索内在于生成过程中，无需外部监督即可高效提取。Gnosis展示了LLM通过内部状态实现自我验证的潜力，为构建更可靠、自知的AI系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

TL;DR: Cube Bench是一个基于魔方的多模态大语言模型基准测试，用于评估空间和序列推理能力，包含五个技能维度，测试结果显示模型性能随魔方复杂度增加而急剧下降，闭源模型表现优于开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在空间和序列推理能力评估方面缺乏系统性的基准测试，特别是针对需要多步规划和错误恢复的复杂任务。魔方问题提供了一个紧凑、可复现的测试平台，能够全面评估模型的感知、决策和执行能力。

Method: 创建Cube Bench基准，将魔方解谜能力分解为五个技能维度：1) 从图像和文本重建魔方面；2) 选择最优下一步移动；3) 预测候选移动结果而不执行；4) 执行多步计划并从中断中恢复；5) 检测和修正自身错误。使用共享的魔方状态集、相同提示和解析器，以及单一的距离解决度量标准，比较不同MLLM在多种打乱深度下的表现。

Result: 测试七个MLLM显示：1) 准确率随打乱深度急剧下降；2) 一旦轨迹停滞或发散，模型很少能恢复；3) 高面重建准确率不能保证良好的动作选择或多步执行能力；4) 闭源与开源模型存在显著差距，闭源模型在单步感知和多步控制任务上都领先；5) 即使最佳MLLM在更高魔方复杂度下也会退化；6) 简单的自我修正通过反思思维带来适度改进，但也可能引入过度思考。

Conclusion: Cube Bench提供了一个紧凑、可复现的基准测试，用于评估MLLM的序列空间推理能力。当前MLLM在复杂空间序列任务上仍有显著局限性，特别是在多步规划和错误恢复方面，闭源模型表现优于开源模型，但所有模型都面临随任务复杂度增加而性能下降的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了扩散模型在高质量长文本生成中的效率和实用性，为长文档生成任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We present MoE-DiffuSeq, a mixture of experts based framework for enhancing diffusion models in long document generation. Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of cloud computing in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has created a critical need for resource and job lifetime prediction to achieve optimal scheduling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise. We propose a novel framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this challenge through text-to-text regression. We introduce the scientific notation and prefix filling to constrain the LLM, significantly improving output format reliability. Moreover, we found that full-attention finetuning and inference improves the prediction accuracy of sliding-window-attention LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new baseline for performance prediction in the EDA domain.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

TL;DR: 开发多模态深度学习模型，整合结构化数据、临床笔记和胸部X光图像，预测ICU患者入院24小时后的院内死亡风险，并在多个外部数据集上验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期预测危重患者的院内死亡率有助于临床医生优化治疗方案，但现有方法可能未充分利用多源临床信息。

Method: 使用MIMIC-III、MIMIC-IV、eICU和HiRID数据集，开发多模态深度学习模型，整合时间不变变量、时间变量、临床笔记和胸部X光图像，预测ICU入院24小时后的死亡风险。

Result: 模型在结构化数据上的AUROC为0.92，AUPRC为0.53，Brier分数0.19；在eICU的8个机构外部验证中AUROC为0.84-0.92；加入临床笔记和影像数据后，AUROC从0.87提升至0.89。

Conclusion: 整合多源患者信息能提升死亡率预测性能，外部验证对模型泛化能力至关重要。

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

Result: 在两个公开锂离子电池数据集上的测试表明，该方法在RUL预测方面超越了现有顶级方法，能准确映射容量退化轨迹

Conclusion: MDFA-Net通过整合深层和浅层属性有效捕捉局部和全局模式，为电池剩余使用寿命预测提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

TL;DR: 提出一种1-bit权重delta压缩方法，仅存储权重差异的符号和轻量级每轴缩放因子，大幅减少模型存储和冷启动延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务多个任务专用LLM变体时，微调检查点的大尺寸导致存储开销大和冷启动延迟高。由于微调权重与基础模型的差异相对较小且结构化，自然想到用压缩delta表示

Method: 提出简单的1-bit delta方案：仅存储权重差异的符号，配合轻量级每轴（行/列）FP16缩放因子。这些缩放因子从小型校准集学习得到，能更准确捕捉权重维度变化。系统层面采用流线化加载器，每个模块单次操作传输打包的delta

Result: 相比标量替代方案，该方法提高了重建质量。生成的artifact比完整FP16检查点小数倍，减少冷启动延迟和存储开销。方法即插即用，需要最少校准数据，通过避免密集重建保持推理效率

Conclusion: 该1-bit delta压缩方案能有效解决多任务LLM变体的存储和冷启动问题，在保持推理效率的同时显著减少模型更新开销

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction. Our experimental setup and source code are available at https://github.com/kuiumdjiev/Per-Axis-Weight-Deltas-for-Frequent-Model-Updates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个符号感知的多状态Jaccard/Tanimoto框架，将基于重叠的距离从非负向量扩展到任意实值和复值信号，同时保持有界度量结构和正定核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Jaccard/Tanimoto相似度方法主要针对非负向量，无法处理包含正负值的实值信号和复值信号。需要一种统一的框架，能够处理任意符号的信号，同时保持数学上的良好性质。

Method: 将信号表示为带符号状态空间上的原子测度，通过广义Jaccard重叠计算相似度。使用正/负分裂处理实信号，笛卡尔和极坐标分解处理复信号，用户定义的状态划分进行精细分析。将信号嵌入到非负多状态表示中，应用Tanimoto构造得到距离。

Result: 得到一族[0,1]范围内的距离，满足三角不等式并定义正定核，可直接用于核方法和基于图的学习。通过Möbius反演进行联盟分析，将信号幅度分解为非负可加贡献。归一化嵌入产生概率测度，距离成为总变差的单调变换。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个统一的、机制可解释的距离度量，同时具备有界度量结构、正定核、概率语义和透明预算核算，支持科学和金融应用中的相关图、特征工程、相似图等分析工具。

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在视觉策略部署到资源受限的边缘设备时面临计算成本和通信延迟挑战。现有方案通常将策略推理卸载到远程服务器，但需要传输高维观测数据并产生网络往返延迟。

Method: 采用分割策略架构：设备端小型编码器（实现为OpenGL片段着色器）将观测转换为紧凑特征张量传输到远程策略头。在强化学习中，这种通信开销表现为闭环决策延迟而非单次推理延迟。

Result: 减少了传输数据量，在带宽受限环境下降低了决策延迟，减少了服务器端计算需求。在单次运行基准测试中，最终回报（最后100回合均值）表现相当，平均回报有适度折衷。在NVIDIA Jetson Nano、Raspberry Pi 4B和Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 提出的分割策略架构有效解决了边缘设备部署视觉策略的挑战，在减少数据传输、降低延迟和服务器计算的同时保持了学习性能，为资源受限环境提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

Motivation: 移动边界系统在工业应用中广泛存在（如树脂传递模塑RTM），但传统数值模拟计算成本高，难以实现实时监测和控制。需要开发快速准确的代理模型来支持数字孪生平台的集成应用。

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

*Haocheng Lu,Minjun Zhu,Henry Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级后训练流程，使用小型数学验证器分析解题错误模式，通过加权DPO优化模型数学推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理上表现不佳，传统方法将解题结果简化为二元判断（正确/错误），忽视了推理过程中的结构性错误。同时，基于人类反馈的强化学习方法成本高、难以扩展且不稳定。

Method: 1. 在MetaMathQA风格的CoT数据上进行监督微调；2. 引入紧凑的MathVerifier，将候选解分解为六维错误特征，生成可解释的错误度和荒谬度分数；3. 利用验证器信号挖掘困难负样本（接近正确但有结构性缺陷）和定义样本重要性权重；4. 通过验证器引导的加权DPO目标进行离线优化。

Result: 在15亿参数的Qwen2.5模型上实验表明，验证器引导的加权DPO比普通SFT和非加权DPO带来更有针对性的改进，特别是在数值接近正确但逻辑不一致的问题上表现更好，同时避免了训练大型奖励模型或依赖外部评判的开销。

Conclusion: 提出了一种实用且轻量级的后训练流程，通过小型验证器分析数学推理中的结构性错误，结合加权DPO实现针对性改进，为LLM数学推理能力的提升提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

Conclusion: ArcGen通过获得架构不变的特征，有效解决了现有学习型后门检测方法在未见架构上泛化能力差的问题，显著提升了跨架构检测性能。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeRAlab/ArcGen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度卷积神经网络在嵌入式场景中取得了显著成功，但网络深度增加会降低硬件效率。浅层网络虽然硬件效率高，但精度往往较差。需要解决这一困境。

Method: 提出Double-Win NAS范式：1) 自动搜索深度网络以获得高精度；2) 将深度网络等价转换为浅层网络以获得高硬件效率；3) 提出混合可转换训练和任意分辨率弹性训练两种增强训练技术。

Result: 在两个流行的智能嵌入式系统（NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier和NVIDIA Jetson Nano）和两个代表性大规模数据集（ImageNet和ImageNet-100）上的实验结果表明，Double-Win NAS优于先前最先进的NAS方法。

Conclusion: Double-Win NAS成功解决了深度网络精度与浅层网络硬件效率之间的权衡问题，为资源受限的嵌入式智能系统提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

### [117] [Leakage-Aware Bandgap Prediction on the JARVIS-DFT Dataset: A Phase-Wise Feature Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19732)
*Gaurav Kumar Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对JARVIS-DFT带隙数据集进行系统分析，移除可能编码带结构信息的描述符，构建泄漏控制的2280材料数据集，通过三阶段建模框架验证描述符扩展对预测精度影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有带隙预测研究中，描述符可能无意中编码了带结构信息（如有效质量），导致数据泄漏问题，影响模型泛化能力。需要构建泄漏控制的数据集来建立可靠的基准。

Method: 1) 系统分析JARVIS-DFT数据集，识别并移除可能编码带结构信息的描述符；2) 构建包含2280个材料的泄漏控制数据集；3) 实施三阶段建模框架：基础物理描述符、工程特征、成分属性；4) 使用树模型评估；5) SHAP分析识别关键特征。

Result: 树模型在所有三个阶段都达到R²≈0.88-0.90，表明在控制泄漏后，扩展描述符空间不会显著提高预测精度。SHAP分析一致显示介电张量分量是最重要的贡献特征。

Conclusion: 提供了泄漏控制的带隙预测数据集和基准性能指标，证明在控制数据泄漏的情况下，简单的描述符集已足够，介电性质是带隙预测的关键物理因素。

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

*Clément Cornet,Romaric Besançon,Hervé Le Borgne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种替代稀疏自编码器的方法，通过聚类激活差异来提取神经网络中的可解释概念，使用偏度加权增强概念多样性，在多种模型和模态上验证效果优于无监督SAE变体


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器（SAEs）方法在从神经网络中提取可解释概念方面存在局限性，需要一种更简单有效的无监督方法来提取多样且高质量的概念

Method: 基于判别分析框架，聚类激活差异，并使用激活偏度对聚类进行加权以增强概念多样性，方法符合德勒兹的现代概念观

Result: 在五种模型和三种模态（视觉、语言、音频）上评估，概念质量超越先前无监督SAE变体，接近有监督基线，提取的概念能够引导模型内部表示，展示对下游行为的因果影响

Conclusion: 该方法为从神经网络中提取可解释概念提供了一种简单有效的无监督替代方案，能够提取高质量、多样且一致的概念，并证明这些概念对模型行为具有因果影响

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

TL;DR: 提出CAP框架，通过案例提示改善LLM在ICU死亡率预测中的公平性和准确性，无需重新训练即可减少90%以上的人口统计偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在ICU死亡率预测中表现出人口统计偏差（性别、年龄、种族），现有去偏方法往往降低预测性能，难以同时优化公平性和准确性。

Method: 开发多维偏差评估方案，提出CAP框架，结合传统去偏提示和基于案例的推理，让模型从历史误判案例中学习，修正有偏推理模式。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，CAP将AUROC从0.806提升至0.873，AUPRC从0.497提升至0.694，同时将性别和种族相关差异减少90%以上。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示框架可以有效共同优化公平性和性能而无需重新训练，为公平的临床决策支持提供了可转移的范式。

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Conclusion: CoPHo通过持续同调和分类器引导实现了高效的条件拓扑生成，无需为每个目标属性重新训练模型，具有良好的实际应用价值

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 列车延误的可靠预测对提高铁路运输系统的鲁棒性和效率至关重要。现有方法需要解决协变量偏移问题，并需要结合事件驱动模型的动态保真度和数据驱动方法的表示能力。

Method: 提出漂移校正模仿学习（DCIL），这是一种自监督算法，通过引入基于距离的漂移校正来扩展DAgger算法，在无需外部oracle或对抗方案的情况下缓解rollout过程中的协变量偏移。该方法将事件驱动模型的动态保真度与数据驱动方法的表示能力相结合，通过蒙特卡洛模拟实现不确定性感知预测。

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

*Soumen Garai,Suman Samui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出OASI初始化策略，利用多目标模拟退火生成高质量种子Pareto集，在TinyML关键词检测任务中优于传统初始化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超低功耗TinyML设备上实现准确的关键词检测需要平衡准确性和资源限制。多目标贝叶斯优化是理想方法，但对初始化高度依赖，现有方法使用简单的采样策略，既不针对Pareto前沿优化，也缺乏统计验证。

Method: 提出Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI)策略，利用Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA)生成高质量、多样化的种子Pareto配置集，明确平衡准确性和模型大小。

Result: 在TinyML关键词检测任务中，OASI在超体积(0.0627)和代际距离(0.0)指标上优于LHS、Sobol和随机初始化，计算时间仅适度增加(1934秒 vs. ~1500秒)。非参数统计分析(Kruskal-Wallis检验)确认了OASI的优越一致性。

Conclusion: OASI为多目标贝叶斯优化提供了一种有效的初始化策略，在TinyML关键词检测任务中显著提升了优化性能，为资源受限设备上的模型优化提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been an active area of research, with applications ranging from healthcare to smart environments. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities to leverage their capabilities in HAR, enabling not just activity classification but also interpretability and human-like interaction. In this paper, we present a Large Multi-Modal Agent designed for HAR, which integrates the power of LLMs to enhance both performance and user engagement. The proposed framework not only delivers activity classification but also bridges the gap between technical outputs and user-friendly insights through its reasoning and question-answering capabilities. We conduct extensive evaluations using widely adopted HAR datasets, including HHAR, Shoaib, Motionsense to assess the performance of our framework. The results demonstrate that our model achieves high classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving interpretability through its reasoning and Q&A capabilities.

TL;DR: CUDA-APML：一种稀疏GPU实现的点云损失函数，通过阈值化可忽略的分配和自适应softmax，在保持APML精度的同时将GPU内存峰值降低99.9%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D点云损失函数存在权衡：Chamfer距离高效但允许多对一对应，Earth Mover距离反映一对一传输但计算成本高，APML通过可微Sinkhorn迭代近似传输但内存呈二次方增长

Method: 提出CUDA-APML稀疏GPU实现，通过阈值化可忽略的分配、运行自适应softmax、双向对称化和直接在COO格式中进行Sinkhorn归一化，实现近线性内存扩展

Result: 在ShapeNet和MM-Fi数据集上，CUDA-APML在较小容差内匹配密集APML性能，同时将GPU峰值内存降低99.9%，代码已开源

Conclusion: CUDA-APML通过稀疏实现解决了APML内存二次方增长问题，在保持几何保真度的同时显著降低计算成本，为大规模点云学习提供了高效损失函数

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

TL;DR: MASS是一个语义感知的稀疏混合专家框架，通过梯度语义漂移检测器和自适应路由策略实现专家池的动态扩展和优化，在语言和视觉任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏混合专家框架要么过度依赖超参数调优，要么在调整专家池大小时忽视了专家间语义角色的多样化，无法充分利用MoE架构的潜力。

Method: 提出MASS框架：1) 基于梯度的语义漂移检测器，当现有专家池无法捕捉数据语义多样性时触发专家扩展；2) 自适应路由策略，根据token级路由置信度动态调整专家使用。

Result: 在合成实验中可靠收敛到成本-性能权衡的最优点；在真实世界语言和视觉数据集上，MASS持续优于多种强基线方法，展示了领域鲁棒性和增强的专家专业化。

Conclusion: MASS通过语义感知的专家扩展和动态路由，有效解决了稀疏混合专家框架中专家语义差异化不足的问题，实现了更好的成本-性能平衡和专家专业化。

Abstract: Finding the optimal configuration of Sparse Mixture-ofExperts (SMoE) that maximizes semantic differentiation among experts is essential for exploiting the full potential of MoE architectures. However, existing SMoE frameworks either heavily rely on hyperparameter tuning or overlook the importance of diversifying semantic roles across experts when adapting the expert pool size. We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型通过先生成推理过程再给出答案来解决问题，但如何有效学习这种推理能力仍是一个挑战。论文旨在形式化推理过程并找到更有效的学习优化方法。

Method: 将推理形式化为隐变量模型，推导出EM优化目标，连接了EM算法与现代基于奖励的优化方法。具体实现了三种采样方案：预算拒绝采样、自教推理器(STaR)和提示后验采样(PPS)。

Result: 在ARC、MMLU和OpenBookQA数据集上使用Llama和Qwen模型的实验表明，采样方案显著影响学习推理模型的准确性。尽管简单，PPS优于其他采样方案。

Conclusion: 推理可以形式化为隐变量模型，采样方案设计是关键挑战，简单的提示后验采样(PPS)在多个基准测试中表现最佳，为推理学习提供了有效的优化框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Result: 在印第安纳州布卢明顿真实数据集上，方法显著优于现有设计和传统启发式。在高公交采用率下，服务率提高25.6%，等待时间缩短30.9%，公交利用率提升21.0%。在混合模式下，路线效率比需求覆盖启发式高68.8%，旅行时间比最短路径构建低5.9%。

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习能够设计出在真实城市规模基准上显著优于人工设计系统和手工启发式的公交网络。

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

TL;DR: 提出randPROM方法：基于神经Galerkin投影和统计层次池化，构建可生成统计可解释、物理合理权重的新型降阶模型，应用于海啸预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降阶模型（如POD）虽然能大幅降低维度并加速计算，但其权重固定，只能模拟特定过程。需要一种能生成新权重、适用于相似问题族、具有统计可解释性和物理合理性的降阶模型。

Method: 结合神经Galerkin投影（将PDE物理编码为初值问题，用神经网络校准权重轨迹）和统计层次池化技术（学习时间权重初值的分布），生成新的统计可解释权重，与空间特征重组形成完整物理代理模型randPROM。

Result: 将randPROM应用于海啸研究（斐济附近合成案例和2011年日本东北海啸），证明能显著减少模拟次数，生成统计校准且物理可辩护的海啸波到达时间和高度预测模型。

Conclusion: randPROM是一种新型降阶模型，能生成与ROM构建所用初值条件邻域分布一致的模拟，为海啸等非线性问题提供统计可解释、物理合理的预测能力。

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

TL;DR: 提出一个营销决策框架，将异质处理效应转化为约束性目标策略，在满足业务护栏条件下最大化收入和留存率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统营销方法通常基于倾向性评分或静态规则，无法有效处理异质处理效应，也难以在满足业务约束（如预算、客户体验）的同时优化关键绩效指标

Method: 使用提升学习器估计条件平均处理效应(CATE)，然后通过约束分配优化决定目标受众和优惠方案，在预算、销售下降容忍度等限制条件下最大化收益

Result: 在留存消息、事件奖励和消费阈值分配等应用中，该框架在离线评估中持续优于倾向性评分和静态基线方法；在线A/B测试进一步验证了其在提升收入和完成率方面的战略效果，同时保持了客户体验约束

Conclusion: 该框架为营销人员提供了一个可重复使用的操作手册，能够规模化实施因果目标定位，设置业务护栏，并使营销活动与战略关键绩效指标保持一致

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Motivation: 现有LLM适应下游任务的方法存在局限性：提示工程在少样本场景有效但随数据增加效果饱和，微调在数据充足时表现好但在少样本时欠佳。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出统一方法：在微调过程中融入上下文学习，使用任务特定数据并增强上下文示例，模拟k-shot提示结构。同时提出prequential评估方法用于低数据场景的超参数选择。

Conclusion: 提出的统一方法有效结合了提示工程和微调的优势，在少样本场景下提供最佳预测性能，同时prequential评估方法解决了低数据场景的超参数选择问题。

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型将计算资源从训练时间转移到推理时间的趋势明显，但推理时间扩展的原理尚不清楚。需要建立可分析的理论模型来理解推理时间计算如何影响模型性能。

Method: 使用贝叶斯线性回归与奖励加权采样器作为分析模型，在高维状态下研究后验预测均值和方差。分析训练数据来自教师模型时的泛化误差，采用softmax温度采样和二次奖励函数。

Result: 当奖励与教师模型差异不大时，泛化误差随推理时间样本k增加单调下降；但奖励错误设定会导致存在有限最优k，超过后采样反而增加误差。存在最优采样温度，且"best-of-k"极限下泛化误差以Θ(1/k²)衰减。

Conclusion: 推理时间计算扩展在某些情况下优于收集更多数据，但当任务难度增加时这种优势会减弱。研究为推理时间计算分配提供了理论指导，并确定了推理时间扩展的有效边界。

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前非遍历性地面运动模型依赖高斯过程方法，存在计算限制，难以进行大规模预测。需要开发更高效的方法来建模空间变化和频率相关性。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器架构，以地震和台站的地理坐标作为条件变量，直接从数据中学习空间模式和频率相关性，生成傅里叶振幅谱的路径效应。

Result: CGM-FAS在旧金山湾区地震数据上与传统高斯过程方法预测结果一致，但计算效率显著提升：可在10秒内为1万个站点和1000个频率生成地图，内存消耗仅几GB。

Conclusion: CGM-FAS为多频率、大空间域的非遍历性地面运动预测提供了高效的新方向，能够学习空间模式而不依赖预设相关函数，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在关键领域部署受到幻觉问题阻碍。传统RLVR范式使用二元奖励信号，无意中鼓励模型成为"好考生"而非诚实沟通者，只要正确概率超过零就会猜测。需要让模型在不确定时能够诚实承认不确定性。

Method: 提出行为校准训练方法，通过优化严格适当评分规则，让模型输出校准后的正确概率。模型可以完全弃权响应，或在不确定的个别声明处标记。使用Qwen3-4B-Instruct进行实验验证。

Result: 行为校准强化学习让小模型在不确定性量化方面超越前沿模型。在数学推理任务上，准确率-幻觉比率增益(0.806)超过GPT-5(0.207)。在事实QA任务中，4B模型的零样本校准误差与Grok-4、Gemini-2.5-Pro等前沿模型相当。

Conclusion: 行为校准是一种可转移的元技能，可与原始预测准确性解耦。该方法能让小模型在不确定性量化方面达到甚至超越前沿大模型的水平，为LLM在关键领域的安全部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

Conclusion: CTF旨在取代临时性比较，通过隐藏测试集的标准化评估提高科学机器学习的严谨性和可复现性，为算法评估提供结构化基础，推动地震学机器学习领域的发展。

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

### [140] [Conditional Adversarial Fragility in Financial Machine Learning under Macroeconomic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19935)
*Samruddhi Baviskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 金融机器学习模型在宏观经济压力期间对抗性脆弱性会系统性放大，需要基于经济压力指标的机制感知评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融决策系统在非平稳经济环境中运行，但对抗性鲁棒性评估通常基于静态假设，忽略了宏观经济压力期间可能出现的系统性脆弱性放大现象。

Method: 提出基于波动率的机制分割方法，将经济环境分为平静期和压力期，在保持模型架构、攻击方法和评估协议不变的情况下，评估不同机制下的对抗性鲁棒性；同时引入基于大语言模型的语义审计解释层。

Result: 模型在平静期和压力期的基线预测性能相当，但在对抗性扰动下，压力期模型表现出更大的性能退化，包括预测准确性、操作决策阈值和风险敏感结果；压力期假阴性率增加，导致高风险案例遗漏风险升高。

Conclusion: 金融机器学习的对抗性鲁棒性是机制依赖属性，需要采用压力感知的模型风险评估方法，特别是在高风险金融部署中。

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

Motivation: 传统机器学习数据处理存在内存占用大和隐私泄露风险的问题，需要一种既能压缩数据又能保护隐私的预处理方法。

Method: 采用Bloom过滤器变换将每个样本编码为紧凑的位数组，在六个数据集上测试，使用四种分类器（XGBoost、DNN、CNN、逻辑回归）进行评估。

Abstract: We present a method that uses the Bloom filter transform to preprocess data for machine learning. Each sample is encoded into a compact, privacy-preserving bit array. This reduces memory use and protects the original data while keeping enough structure for accurate classification. We test the method on six datasets: SMS Spam Collection, ECG200, Adult 50K, CDC Diabetes, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST. Four classifiers are used: Extreme Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression. Results show that models trained on Bloom filter encodings achieve accuracy similar to models trained on raw data or other transforms. At the same time, the method provides memory savings while enhancing privacy. These results suggest that the Bloom filter transform is an efficient preprocessing approach for diverse machine learning tasks.

TL;DR: LoFT-LLM：一种结合低频学习和LLM语义校准的频率感知时序预测方法，在金融和能源数据上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时序预测面临训练数据有限、时序动态复杂且噪声大的挑战。现有深度预测模型通常使用完整时间窗口监督预测，包含大量高频噪声且掩盖长期趋势，同时辅助变量中的领域特定信息在少样本场景下未被充分利用。

Method: 提出LoFT-LLM频率感知预测流程：1) 补丁低频预测模块(PLFM)从局部频谱补丁提取稳定低频趋势；2) 残差学习器建模高频变化；3) 微调LLM通过结构化自然语言提示整合辅助上下文和领域知识来精炼预测。

Result: 在金融和能源数据集上的大量实验表明，LoFT-LLM在全数据和少样本场景下均显著优于强基线方法，提供更优的准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: LoFT-LLM通过结合低频学习和LLM语义校准，有效解决了时序预测中的噪声问题和领域知识利用不足的挑战，为实际应用提供了准确、鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CVSI方法，通过控制变量统一DSI和TSI两种分数估计器，在噪声谱上实现方差最小化，提高扩散模型采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型需要准确估计噪声扰动目标分布的分数。现有两种估计器存在根本性的方差权衡：基于数据样本的DSI在低噪声区域方差高，而基于目标能量函数的TSI在高噪声区域方差高。需要解决这种方差权衡问题。

Method: 提出控制变量分数恒等式（CVSI），在控制变量的理论框架下统一DSI和TSI两种估计器。推导出最优的时变控制系数，理论上保证在整个噪声谱上的方差最小化。

Result: CVSI作为稳健的低方差插件估计器，在无数据采样器学习和推理时扩散采样中都显著提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 通过控制变量框架统一DSI和TSI，提出的CVSI方法有效解决了分数估计中的方差权衡问题，为扩散模型提供了更高效的采样方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出OGAB激活函数，通过正交性和分组感知偏置学习缓解深度学习中的类别不平衡问题，无需显式标签信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习和数据挖掘中的常见挑战，会导致分类器性能下降。尽管深度学习在特征提取方面表现出色，但在不平衡数据下性能仍然会恶化。现有方法通常通过数据预处理修改或后处理修正来解决类别不平衡，但本文希望在训练阶段嵌入学习层面直接解决这一问题。

Method: 提出OGAB激活函数，包含两个核心机制：1) 正交变换保持特征独立性，防止多数类在嵌入空间中占据主导；2) 分组感知偏置机制自动识别数据聚类并调整嵌入以增强类别可分性，无需显式监督。该方法在训练阶段嵌入学习层面解决类别不平衡，可直接集成到学习过程中。

Result: 在真实世界和合成的类别不平衡数据集上验证了OGAB的有效性，相比传统和可学习激活函数，表现出持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 激活函数可以引入强归纳偏置来解决复杂的数据挑战，超越传统的非线性功能。正交变换可以保持少数类的信息，分组感知偏置机制能自动增强类别可分性。OGAB为深度学习中的类别不平衡问题提供了一种新颖的训练阶段解决方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

Conclusion: DecoKAN成功弥合了预测准确性和模型透明度之间的差距，为复杂加密货币市场提供了可信的决策支持，推动了可解释预测模型的发展。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable forecasting of multivariate time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets in digital asset systems. Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets.

Motivation: 可控马尔可夫链描述了顺序决策任务的动态，是优化控制和强化学习的核心组件。然而，在未知环境中学习可控动态时，需要设计有效的探索策略来最大化信息增益，同时考虑到某些特殊状态（如瞬态、吸收态）对动态控制的限制。

Conclusion: 该工作为在未知环境中学习可控动态提供了一种最优探索策略，该策略简单易实现、计算高效，能够通过"边探索边学习"的方式最大化信息增益。特殊状态的存在使得非平稳策略成为实现最优探索的必要条件。

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

Conclusion: PairFlow是一种高效、轻量级的离散流模型预处理方法，在分子数据、二值和RGB图像等多种应用场景中表现出广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: QE-Catalytic通过深度耦合语言模型与几何模型，显著提升吸附能预测精度，同时支持文本驱动预测和结构逆设计，为催化筛选提供更可靠工具

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the widely existing contextual and structural divergence may influence the representation learning in rich-text graphs. To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that DMPGCN and DMPPRG can outperform other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing paradigm

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Conclusion: BrainROI模型通过软功能分区和可解释提示优化，有效解决了多模态脑解码的跨被试泛化和可解释性问题，提升了脑活动信号重建语义信息的性能

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

Conclusion: CDSP-MoE通过从隔离专家容器到共享子空间动态专家实例化的范式转变，有效解决了传统MoE的局限性，实现了更灵活、鲁棒的专家混合架构。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 数据异构性和部分客户端参与是联邦学习中的两大挑战。数据异构导致局部模型更新方差大，使全局模型偏离最优解；部分客户端参与进一步加剧了这一问题，使聚合偏向参与客户端的数据分布，导致全局模型更新方差增加，训练不稳定，性能下降。现有研究主要关注数据异构，对部分客户端参与的影响关注较少。

Result: 在多个异构划分数据集上的图像分类任务实验表明，FedDPC优于最先进的联邦学习算法，在通信轮次中实现了更快的训练损失下降和更高的测试准确率。

Conclusion: FedDPC通过同时解决数据异构性和部分客户端参与问题，有效提高了联邦学习的训练效率和全局模型性能。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

*Maximilian Witte,Johannes Meuer,Étienne Plésiat,Christopher Kadow*

TL;DR: 提出Field-Space Attention机制，在物理域而非潜在空间计算注意力，用于地球系统Transformer，保持连续场表示，实现可解释内部状态和科学约束实施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要能够直接处理连续地球物理场并保持其几何结构的机器学习架构，以实现准确且物理一致的地球系统动力学建模。

Method: 引入Field-Space attention机制，在物理域计算注意力；使用固定的非学习多尺度分解；学习输入场的结构保持变形；在球面上保持所有中间表示为连续场。

Result: 应用于HEALPix网格上的全球温度超分辨率任务，比传统Vision Transformer和U-Net基线收敛更快更稳定，参数更少；保持场结构允许嵌入物理和统计先验，提高保真度和可靠性。

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention作为紧凑、可解释且物理基础构建块，适用于下一代地球系统预测和生成建模框架。

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出Clust-PSI-PFL框架，使用PSI指标量化非IID数据，通过聚类形成分布同质客户端组，在多种数据集上显著提升全局准确率和客户端公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据的非独立同分布（non-IID）特性会导致模型更新偏差和性能下降，需要有效的个性化联邦学习框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Clust-PSI-PFL框架：1）使用加权PSI指标（WPSI^L）量化非IID程度；2）基于PSI特征通过K-means++聚类形成分布同质客户端组；3）采用轮廓系数法确定最优聚类数量；4）在聚类内进行个性化联邦学习。

Result: 在六个数据集（表格、图像、文本）和两种数据划分协议下，相比最先进基线方法：1）全局准确率提升高达18%；2）在严重非IID数据下客户端公平性相对提升37%；3）WPSI^L指标比常用非IID度量更有效。

Conclusion: PSI引导的聚类是一种原理清晰、轻量级的机制，能够在标签偏斜情况下实现鲁棒的个性化联邦学习，显著提升模型性能和客户端公平性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

*Corey Adams,Rishikesh Ranade,Ram Cherukuri,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoTransolver是一个多尺度几何感知物理注意力Transformer，用于CAE替代模拟，通过GALE注意力机制结合物理感知自注意力和多尺度几何上下文交叉注意力，在复杂几何和非线性物理场景中实现高精度代理建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAE替代模型在处理复杂不规则几何和强非线性物理场景时，难以有效整合几何结构、边界条件和全局参数信息，导致精度和鲁棒性不足。需要一种能够统一多尺度几何感知上下文与物理注意力机制的可扩展Transformer架构。

Method: 提出GeoTransolver，采用GALE注意力机制：1）在学习的物理状态切片上应用物理感知自注意力；2）通过多尺度球查询（受DoMINO启发）计算共享的几何/全局/边界条件上下文；3）在每个块中重用该上下文。在NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo中实现，持续将几何、全局和边界条件参数投影到物理状态空间。

Result: 在DrivAerML、Luminary SHIFT-SUV和Luminary SHIFT-Wing数据集上评估，相比Domino、Transolver和AB-UPT，GeoTransolver在阻力/升力R2和场变量相对L1误差方面表现更优，具有更好的精度、对几何/工况变化的鲁棒性以及数据效率优势。

Conclusion: GeoTransolver通过统一多尺度几何感知上下文与物理注意力机制，为复杂不规则几何和非线性物理场景的高保真代理建模提供了先进的算子学习方法，推动了CAE替代模型的发展。

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

*Xuan-An Le,Minh-Nam Tran,Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE是一个两阶段知识蒸馏框架，通过引入中等规模的教师助手，在有限预算下将大型专有模型知识迁移到超小型可部署模型（<1B参数），显著提升性能并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型专有模型（如GPT-4）与小型可部署模型之间存在1000倍容量差距，直接知识蒸馏效果有限，同时API调用成本高昂限制了数据收集，需要解决容量预算陷阱。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段，中等规模教师助手（约7B）在严格限制的数据子集（3-5%）上从黑盒教师学习，使用零API成本管道平衡熵难度和语义多样性；第二阶段，利用教师助手免费推理生成完整数据集的合成推理链来训练超小型学生模型，并采用指令调优课程建立行为对齐。

Result: 在医疗、法律和金融基准测试中，BRIDGE使学生模型性能提升28-41%，将能力差距缩小12-16%，同时使用10倍更少的教师查询，仅用5%资源就超越了使用100%预算的直接蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: BRIDGE通过战略性的中间层和预算不对称设计，有效解决了容量预算陷阱，突破了传统的成本性能边界，为在有限预算下将大型模型知识迁移到超小型模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于任务特定归一化的轻量级多任务学习方法，通过简单的归一化层替换就能实现竞争性能，挑战了复杂多任务架构的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）虽然能利用任务间的共享知识提升泛化能力和参数效率，但资源平衡和任务干扰问题仍未解决。现有架构方案通常引入复杂的任务特定模块或路由机制，增加了复杂性和开销。

Method: 提出Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization（TSσBN），一种轻量级机制，通过任务特定的归一化层使任务能够软分配网络容量，同时完全共享特征提取器。该方法仅用归一化层就能解决多任务学习的核心挑战。

Result: TSσBN在CNN和Transformer中都能提升稳定性，在NYUv2、Cityscapes、CelebA和PascalContext等数据集上达到或超越现有性能，同时保持高度参数效率。学习到的门控机制为分析MTL动态提供了可解释的框架。

Conclusion: 复杂的多任务学习架构可能是不必要的，任务特定归一化提供了一种简单、可解释且高效的替代方案。归一化层本身就足以解决多任务学习的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用和网站的用户受挫会导致销售损失和投诉，企业需要预测用户受挫会话以改善用户体验和业务表现。

Method: 基于特定规则定义受挫会话（包括愤怒点击、来回导航、购物车流失、搜索困难和长时间徘徊），从304,881个会话中提取特征，使用XGBoost训练表格特征，同时使用完整事件序列训练判别式LSTM分类器。

Result: XGBoost达到约90%准确率和0.9579 ROC AUC，LSTM表现最佳，达到约91%准确率和0.9705 ROC AUC。研究还显示LSTM仅需前20-30次交互即可可靠预测受挫。

Conclusion: 点击流数据可用于有效预测用户受挫，LSTM模型在序列数据处理上表现优异，且早期预测能力有助于及时干预改善用户体验。

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

Abstract: Recurrent off-policy deep reinforcement learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are often sidelined due to their high computational demands. In response, we introduce RISE (Recurrent Integration via Simplified Encodings), a novel approach that can leverage recurrent networks in any image-based off-policy RL setting without significant computational overheads via using both learnable and non-learnable encoder layers. When integrating RISE into leading non-recurrent off-policy RL algorithms, we observe a 35.6% human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance improvement across the Atari benchmark. We analyze various implementation strategies to highlight the versatility and potential of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: SHAPformer：基于Transformer的快速、免采样的可解释时间序列预测模型，通过注意力机制生成SHAP解释，比传统SHAP方法快几个数量级


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测对规划决策至关重要，可解释性对建立用户信任和满足透明度要求很关键。现有SHAP框架缺乏针对时间序列的高效实现，且采样反事实时通常假设特征独立。

Method: 基于Transformer架构，通过注意力操作使模型能够基于特征子集进行预测，实现准确、快速且免采样的可解释时间序列预测。

Result: SHAPformer在1秒内生成解释，比SHAP置换解释器快几个数量级；在合成数据上提供符合真实数据的解释；在真实电力负荷数据上实现有竞争力的预测性能，并提供有意义的局部和全局洞察。

Conclusion: SHAPformer是一个高效的可解释时间序列预测模型，能够快速生成准确的SHAP解释，识别关键预测因子，并揭示模型在不同时间段的行为模式。

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FailFast 是一个基于扩散大语言模型(dLLM)的推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测长度实现高效加速，无需微调即可获得高达4.9倍的加速比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLM)虽然能并行生成token，但单独使用时存在效率与质量的权衡问题。作者发现，如果巧妙应用，dLLM的特性可以成为推测解码中草稿生成器的优势。

Method: 提出FailFast框架，利用dLLM并行解码的速度优势降低拒绝成本，动态调整推测长度：在难以推测的区域"快速失败"以减少计算开销，在容易推测的区域"大胆获胜"以延长草稿长度减少验证延迟。

Result: 无需微调即可实现无损加速，相比原始解码获得最高4.9倍加速，相比最佳朴素dLLM草稿生成器获得1.7倍加速，相比EAGLE-3获得1.4倍加速，在某些情况下能一次推测并接受70个token。

Conclusion: FailFast成功将dLLM的并行解码能力转化为推测解码的优势，通过动态调整推测长度实现了显著的速度提升，为LLM推理加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

TL;DR: 提出了PePG算法，这是首个考虑RL中执行性（performativity）的策略梯度算法，能够收敛到执行最优策略，优于仅追求执行稳定的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署后的机器学习算法会影响其作用的环境，从而改变标准RL方法所忽略的底层动态。虽然监督学习中的执行性最优算法已有研究，但RL中的执行性问题仍未被充分探索。

Method: 证明了RL中执行性版本的性能差异引理和策略梯度定理，并提出了执行性策略梯度算法（PePG）。PePG是首个考虑RL执行性的策略梯度算法，在softmax参数化和有无熵正则化下都能收敛。

Result: PePG能够收敛到执行最优策略，即那些在自身引起的分布偏移下仍保持最优的策略。这显著扩展了先前仅追求执行稳定性的工作。在标准执行性RL环境中的实证分析表明，PePG优于标准策略梯度算法和现有的执行性RL算法。

Conclusion: PePG是首个解决RL中执行性问题的策略梯度算法，能够收敛到执行最优策略，在理论和实证上都优于现有方法，为处理RL中的分布偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工标注的训练数据对许多机器学习任务至关重要，但数据质量控制在文献中很少受到关注，尽管不同标注工作的数据质量差异很大。需要更好的方法来评估和提升标注数据的质量。

Method: 提出使用统计方法测量标注一致性和一致性度量来评估数据质量。通过多轮标注记录一致性指标，其中方差下降表明数据质量提高。还提出了一种无需每个工作项多次标注的高质量数据收集方法。

Result: 一致性度量在多轮标注中能给出更可靠的结果，方差下降是数据质量提高的指标。展示了一种无需每个项目多次标注的高质量数据收集方法，并发现标注者的"适应期"可能不足以最小化标注错误。

Conclusion: 统计方法可以有效评估和提升人工标注训练数据的质量，多轮标注的一致性度量是可靠的质量指标，需要更系统的方法来确保标注数据的质量，而不仅仅是依赖标注者的适应期。

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

Motivation: 为神经网络提供新的博弈论解释框架，将网络评估转化为博弈值计算，从而利用博弈论工具分析神经网络性质，如输出边界、鲁棒性验证和训练问题。

Method: 提出ReLU net game概念，将ReLU网络输出建模为零和回合制停止博弈的值，建立网络前向传播与Shapley-Bellman反向递归的等价关系，推导离散Feynman-Kac路径积分公式，并将训练问题转化为逆博弈问题。

Result: 成功建立了神经网络与博弈论之间的数学对应关系，证明了网络输出可作为博弈值计算，提供了基于策略证书的鲁棒性验证方法，并将训练问题重新表述为逆博弈问题，同时方法可推广到Softplus激活函数。

Conclusion: 博弈论框架为神经网络分析提供了新视角，将网络评估、边界分析、鲁棒性验证和训练统一在博弈论框架下，为理解神经网络行为开辟了新途径，并可扩展到其他激活函数类型。

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的理论框架来解释神经网络梯度下降训练中出现的简单性偏置现象，通过鞍点到鞍点的学习动态分析，揭示了网络如何逐步学习越来越复杂的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管梯度下降训练的神经网络经常表现出学习复杂度随时间增加的现象（简单性偏置），但现有理论缺乏统一框架来解释这一现象在不同架构中的普遍性。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架，分析鞍点到鞍点的学习动态，包括固定点、不变流形和梯度下降动态。该框架适用于全连接、卷积和注意力架构，通过分析网络如何迭代地在不变流形附近演化、接近鞍点并切换到另一个流形来解释简单性偏置。

Result: 证明线性网络学习秩递增的解，ReLU网络学习拐点数量递增的解，卷积网络学习卷积核数量递增的解，自注意力模型学习注意力头数量递增的解。同时阐明了数据分布和权重初始化对学习平台期持续时间和数量的影响。

Conclusion: 该理论为理解梯度下降何时以及为何逐步学习越来越复杂的解提供了一个统一框架，解离了先前混淆的因素，并解释了不同神经网络架构中简单性偏置的共同机制。

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统主要在定义良好的基准或通用任务（如文献检索）上进行评估，限制了它们在开放科学场景中的端到端问题解决能力。物理学特别具有挑战性，因为它抽象、数学密集，需要将分析推理与基于代码的计算相结合。

Method: PhysMaster将抽象推理与数值计算相结合，并利用LANDAU（分层学术数据宇宙）知识库，该库保存检索到的文献、整理的先验知识和验证的方法轨迹。它还采用自适应探索策略来平衡效率与开放式探索。

Result: 在高能理论、凝聚态理论和天体物理学等问题上的评估显示：(i) 加速：将劳动密集型研究从数月压缩到数小时；(ii) 自动化：自主执行假设驱动的循环；(iii) 自主发现：独立探索开放问题。

Conclusion: PhysMaster作为一个自主理论物理学家代理，能够有效处理物理研究中的超长视野任务，展示了LLM在加速、自动化和自主科学发现方面的潜力。

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Motivation: PlantCLEF 2025挑战赛需要从高分辨率图像中进行细粒度多标签物种识别。传统方法难以处理高分辨率植被图像中的多物种识别问题，需要一种能够适应从单物种分类到多标签分类的域适应方法。

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Result: 在PlantNet300k数据集上的初步实验揭示了未来工作需要发展的关键点，尽管方法中某些组件尚未完全优化，但仍在该数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过类内聚类生成伪标签进行层次分类的方法能够缓解细粒度视觉分类中的类内变异问题，提升分类性能，在PlantNet300k数据集上表现优异，但仍有优化空间。

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Method: 设计了S³IT基准测试，核心是座位排序任务：在3D环境中为具有不同身份、偏好和复杂人际关系的LLM驱动NPC安排座位。采用可扩展的程序化框架生成多样化场景，要求智能体通过主动对话获取偏好、自主探索环境感知、在复杂约束网络中进行多目标优化。

Result: 评估了最先进的LLM在S³IT上的表现，发现它们仍然难以解决此问题，与人类基线存在明显差距。结果表明LLM在空间智能方面存在不足，但在处理具有明确文本线索的冲突方面能达到接近人类水平的能力。

Conclusion: S³IT基准测试填补了具身社会智能评估的空白，揭示了LLM在整合物理和社会约束方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Conclusion: LieFlow能够直接从数据中学习对称性，为物理系统理解和机器学习应用提供了有效的对称性发现工具

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Conclusion: 强化学习为工业级内容审核系统提供了可行的解决方案，能够在数据稀缺的真实场景中实现专家级准确率，为大规模内容审核的实际部署提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

Motivation: 当前临床决策支持系统面临关键挑战：在实现高预测准确性的同时生成与预测对齐的解释。现有方法存在暴露偏差问题，导致解释与预测不一致。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：第一阶段训练模型进行理由生成；第二阶段联合训练标签预测和理由生成，应用计划采样逐步从基于黄金标签的条件转换到基于模型预测的条件。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上评估，包括专有分诊数据集和公共生物医学QA数据集。Reason2Decide在预测(F1)和理由保真度(BERTScore、BLEU、LLM-as-a-Judge)方面优于其他微调基线和一些零样本LLM。在分诊任务中，Reason2Decide对LLM生成、护士撰写和护士后处理的理由具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Reason2Decide使用比当代基础模型小40倍的模型实现了这些优势，使临床推理在资源受限的部署中更加可访问，同时仍提供可解释的决策支持。LLM生成的理由适合预训练模型，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolAct是一个基于智能体强化学习的分子设计框架，通过两阶段训练（先学编辑能力，再学优化）实现多步分子编辑与优化，利用工具交互保证化学有效性和结构相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子编辑和优化是多步骤问题，需要迭代改进性质同时保持化学有效性和结构相似性。传统方法难以同时处理这些约束，因此需要将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题。

Method: 提出MolAct框架，采用两阶段训练：第一阶段建立编辑能力，第二阶段重用学习到的编辑行为进行性质优化。智能体学习在推理、工具使用和分子优化之间交替进行，通过多轮交互调用化学工具进行有效性检查、性质评估和相似性控制。

Result: 在分子编辑任务中，MolEditAgent-7B在添加、删除和替换编辑中分别达到100、95和98的有效性，优于DeepSeek-R1等强基线；在分子优化任务中，MolOptAgent-7B在LogP上超越Claude 3.7等基线，在溶解度上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 将分子设计视为多步骤、工具增强的过程是实现可靠和可解释改进的关键。MolAct框架首次将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题，展示了智能体学习编辑行为并重用于优化的有效性。

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种简单有效的方法：在时间序列数据tokenization前注入噪声，以提升冻结LLM在零样本时间序列预测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖微调专用模块来桥接LLM与时间序列数据之间的差距，但完全冻结的LLM性能对输入数据的文本表示非常敏感。需要一种无需微调就能提升冻结LLM时间序列预测能力的方法。

Method: 在原始时间序列数据tokenization前注入噪声，作为一种推理时增强手段，迫使冻结的LLM基于稳健的底层时间模式而非表面数值伪影进行外推。

Result: 通过理论分析和多个基准测试的实证验证，该方法能显著提升性能。特别地，在两个全新的时间序列数据集上（确保无预训练数据污染），一致观察到性能改进。

Conclusion: 噪声注入是一种简单有效的非侵入性干预，能够提升冻结LLM在时间序列预测中的稳健性，为直接利用现成LLM进行时间序列预测提供了进一步进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

TL;DR: 使用BiGRU神经网络预测数据中心PUE值，通过特征选择和超参数优化提升预测精度，并与GRU模型进行性能比较。


<details>

Motivation: 数据中心能耗巨大且碳足迹显著，随着边缘计算和AI发展，存储容量需求增长。提高能源效率是应对气候变化、降低成本、提升竞争力的关键。PUE作为数据中心运营效率指标，通过神经网络预测可识别影响能耗的关键特征，从而进行针对性优化。

Method: 开发基于双向门控循环单元(BiGRU)的PUE预测模型。使用EnergyPlus模拟新加坡数据中心，包含52,560个样本和117个特征。采用递归特征消除交叉验证(RFECV)算法选择最相关特征集，针对不同参数设置优化特征选择。使用选定的特征集寻找最优超参数配置并训练BiGRU模型。

Result: 将优化后的BiGRU模型与GRU模型进行比较，使用均方误差(MSE)、平均绝对误差(MAE)和R平方指标评估性能。结果表明BiGRU模型在PUE预测方面表现更优。

Conclusion: BiGRU模型能够有效预测数据中心PUE值，为能源效率优化提供数据支持。通过特征选择和超参数优化可进一步提升预测精度，有助于数据中心能源管理的智能化改进。

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Motivation: 比较人类与大型语言模型在概念推理任务中的泛化能力差异，探索两者在归纳偏置和推理策略上的根本区别

Method: 使用数字游戏作为概念推理任务，以贝叶斯模型为分析框架，对比分析人类和LLM的归纳偏置与推理策略

Result: 贝叶斯模型能更好地捕捉人类行为：人类灵活推断基于规则和相似性的概念，LLM更依赖数学规则；人类能从单样本实现少样本泛化，LLM需要更多样本

Conclusion: 人类与LLM在数学概念推断和泛化方面存在根本性差异，揭示了当前LLM与人类认知机制的重要区别

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

TL;DR: 提出PreSa方法，通过直接学习策略而非奖励/成本模型，结合偏好学习和安全对齐，在离线偏好强化学习中实现安全策略学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线偏好强化学习（PbRL）避免了大量奖励工程和人工标注交互，但安全性仍是关键挑战。现有基于人类反馈的安全RL方法先学习奖励和成本模型，再用约束RL优化策略，在长时域连续控制任务中，奖励和成本误差会累积，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出PreSa框架：1）直接基于行为偏好和轨迹段安全二元标签学习策略；2）结合偏好学习模块和安全对齐的约束优化问题；3）在拉格朗日框架内求解，无需显式学习奖励和成本模型，避免使用约束RL。

Result: 在连续控制任务上（合成和真实人类反馈）评估，方法成功学习到高奖励的安全策略，优于最先进的基线方法，甚至超过使用真实奖励和成本的离线安全RL方法。

Conclusion: PreSa方法通过直接学习策略，结合偏好学习和安全对齐，有效解决了离线偏好强化学习中的安全挑战，避免了奖励/成本模型误差累积问题，在连续控制任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统主要优化压缩和存储，但对记忆检索的显式闭环控制关注不足。需要构建一个自主、准确且兼容的记忆检索系统来提升LLM代理的决策质量。

Method: 1) 路由器机制：在检索、反思和回答三个动作中选择最优路径；2) 全局证据缺口跟踪器：显式呈现回答过程并跟踪证据收集进度。该系统采用闭环控制而非传统的检索-回答流水线。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，MemR³超越了强基线模型，在LLM-as-a-Judge评分上表现优异。特别地，它在四类现有检索器上都有改进，使用GPT-4.1-mini后端时，RAG提升了7.29%，Zep提升了1.94%。

Conclusion: MemR³为现有记忆存储提供了一个即插即用的控制器，通过引入闭环控制机制实现了自主决策，显著提升了记忆检索系统的性能和透明度。

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络向5G独立组网和6G演进，运营商面临超出静态自动化和深度强化学习能力的编排挑战。虽然大型语言模型代理为实现意图驱动网络提供了路径，但它们引入了随机风险，包括拓扑幻觉和政策不合规问题。

Method: 提出Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC)神经符号框架，通过确定性验证约束概率规划。架构依赖于治理三要素：电信适配代理(TSLAM-4B)、网络知识图谱(NKG)和SHACL约束。

Result: 在模拟的450节点5G核心网上评估，实现了零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率，显著优于82.4%的基线。消融分析显示NKG验证贡献了68%的安全增益，SHACL策略贡献24%。在10K到100K节点拓扑上的可扩展性测试显示验证延迟按O(k^1.2)扩展。

Conclusion: G-SPEC通过神经符号方法有效缓解了LLM代理在电信网络中的随机风险，142ms的处理开销使其适用于SMO层操作，为5G/6G网络的安全编排提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

Conclusion: ActionFlow通过系统级优化解决了VLA模型在边缘设备上的高延迟问题，实现了实时机器人控制，为动态真实世界环境中的VLA部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

Conclusion: SynCraft通过推理驱动的结构编辑方法有效解决了生成分子的可合成性问题，平衡了结构新颖性与合成可行性，为药物发现提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

TL;DR: VLSM模型通过视觉-语言统一理解，从布局草图和自然语言提示生成可执行的FlexScript代码，为工业仿真系统提供跨模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业仿真系统需要将视觉布局和自然语言描述转化为可执行代码，现有方法缺乏统一的跨模态理解和生成能力，限制了数字孪生的自动化水平。

Method: 提出Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM)，统一视觉和文本理解；构建首个大规模生成式数字孪生数据集（12万+提示-草图-代码三元组）；设计三个专用评估指标：SVR、PMR、ESR。

Result: 模型在结构完整性、参数匹配和执行成功率方面表现优异，通过系统消融实验验证了视觉编码器、连接器和代码预训练语言骨干的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为生成式数字孪生奠定了基础，将视觉推理和语言理解集成到可执行的工业仿真系统中，实现了跨模态的自动化代码生成。

Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出Bohrium+SciMaster架构，通过基础设施和生态系统方法解决规模化智能体科学面临的挑战，将科学工具转化为智能体就绪能力，并实现可追踪、可复现的长期科学工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体正成为运行多步骤科学工作流的实用方式，但规模化智能体科学面临诸多挑战：工作流难以观察和复现、许多工具和实验室系统不支持智能体、执行难以追踪和治理、原型系统通常是定制化的限制了重用和系统性改进。

Method: 提出Bohrium+SciMaster架构：Bohrium作为AI4S资产的托管可追踪中心（类似科学AI的HuggingFace），将科学数据、软件、计算和实验室系统转化为智能体就绪能力；SciMaster将这些能力编排成长期科学工作流；科学智能基板组织可重用模型、知识和组件，形成可执行的工作流推理和行动构建块。

Result: 在11个代表性主智能体的真实工作流中演示该架构，实现了端到端科学周期时间的数量级减少，并从真实工作负载中生成了数百万规模的执行基础信号。

Conclusion: 规模化智能体科学需要基础设施和生态系统方法，Bohrium+SciMaster架构通过提供可追踪、可组合、可审计的工作流执行环境，使科学智能体能够规模化运行，促进系统性改进和可信评估。

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

*Chehak Malhotra,Mehak Gopal,Akshaya Devadiga,Pradeep Singh,Ridam Pal,Ritwik Kashyap,Tavpritesh Sethi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）与小型语言模型（SLMs）在预测危重患者休克方面的性能，发现尽管GatorTron-Base在加权召回率上表现最佳（80.5%），但整体性能相当，表明LLMs在预测临床事件方面并不固有优于SLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但在预测性任务中的应用研究较少。及时预测休克可以促进早期干预，改善患者预后。本研究旨在比较LLMs与传统SLMs在预测危重患者休克方面的性能，为临床预测任务建立基准。

Method: 使用MIMIC III数据库中17,294例ICU住院患者的文本数据，筛选出住院时间>24小时且休克指数(SI)>0.7的患者，得到355例正常SI和87例异常SI患者。比较了GatorTron-Base（临床数据训练）、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等LLMs与BioBERT、DocBERT、BioClinicalBERT、Word2Vec、Doc2Vec等SLMs。在微调过程中使用focal loss和交叉熵损失来处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: GatorTron-Base获得了最高的加权召回率（80.5%），但LLMs和SLMs的整体性能指标相当。这表明尽管LLMs在文本任务上表现出色，但在预测未来临床事件方面并不固有优于SLMs。

Conclusion: LLMs在预测临床事件方面并不固有优于SLMs。为了实现有意义的临床结果，未来训练LLMs应优先开发能够预测临床轨迹的模型，而不是专注于命名实体识别或表型分类等简单任务。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Conclusion: 本研究通过构建大规模教师多模态情感分析数据集和提出创新的非对称注意力模型，为教师情感分析提供了有效的解决方案，有助于提升教育质量和教学效果评估。

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: 基于思维链推理的AI规划代理SAGE在立体定向放射外科治疗中，相比非推理模型能生成与人类规划师相当的治疗计划，同时降低耳蜗剂量，并提供可审计的透明规划过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体定向放射外科需要精确的剂量分布，但黑盒AI系统因不透明性而临床采用有限。研究旨在测试思维链推理是否能改善AI代理的规划能力，提高临床可接受性和透明度。

Method: 开发了SAGE（安全生成剂量专家代理），一个基于大语言模型的SRS自动规划代理。在41例脑转移瘤患者的回顾性队列中，比较了推理模型和非推理模型两种变体生成的计划，评估剂量学参数和规划行为。

Result: 推理模型在主要终点（PTV覆盖率、最大剂量、适形指数、梯度指数）上与人类规划师相当（所有p>0.21），同时将耳蜗剂量降低到人类基线以下（p=0.022）。推理模型展示了前瞻性约束验证（457次）和权衡审议（609次）等系统性规划行为，而非推理模型几乎没有这些审议过程。

Conclusion: 思维链推理使AI规划代理能够生成与人类相当的治疗计划，同时提供可审计的优化轨迹，为透明自动化规划开辟了道路，解决了黑盒AI系统的临床采用障碍。

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

Motivation: 开发一个在动理学到流体动力学所有尺度都有效的统一数值方法，解决传统方法在不同流动区域需要不同模型的局限性，特别是在低马赫数条件下实现跨尺度模拟。

Method: 基于格子Boltzmann离散速度模型，采用隐式显式Runge-Kutta方法保证时间精度和刚性区域稳定性，结合有限差分WENO重构和高阶中心差分近似提高空间分辨率，确保在渐近极限下退化为不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程的高阶有限差分格式。

Conclusion: 成功开发了一个统一有效的数值框架，能够在低马赫数条件下跨越动理学到流体动力学的所有尺度进行模拟，保持物理一致性，为跨尺度流动问题提供了高效可靠的数值工具。

Abstract: We consider a Lattice Boltzmann type discrete velocity model in the low Mach number scaling and develop a corresponding numerical scheme that remains uniformly valid across all regimes of the mean free path, from the kinetic to the hydrodynamic scale. The proposed framework ensures high order temporal accuracy through the use of Implicit Explicit Runge Kutta methods, which provide stability and efficiency in stiff regimes, while spatial resolution is enhanced by combining finite difference WENO reconstructions with high order central difference approximations. In the appropriate asymptotic limit, the scheme reduces to a high order finite difference formulation of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations, thereby guaranteeing physical consistency of the numerical approximation with the limit model. To corroborate the theoretical findings, a set of numerical experiments is performed on two dimensional benchmark problems, which confirm the accuracy, stability, and versatility of the method across different flow regimes.

Abstract: This paper presents a new Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm for time-dependent particle transport problems with global variance reduction based on automatic weight windows (WWs). The centers of WWs at a time step are defined by the solution of an auxiliary hybrid MC / deterministic problem formed by the low-order second-moment (LOSM) equations. The closures for the hybrid LOSM equations are calculated by the MC method. The LOSM equations are discretized by a scheme of the second-order accuracy in time and space. Filtering techniques are applied to reduce noise effects in the LOSM closures. The WWs defined with the auxiliary solution give rise to sufficiently uniform MC particle distribution in space on each time step. The algorithm is analyzed by means of an analytic transport benchmark. We study performance of the MC algorithm depending on a set parameters of WWs. Figure of merit and relative error results are presented, demonstrating the performance of the hybrid MC method and quantifying its computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose and study a general quasi-interpolation framework for stochastic function approximation, which stems and draws motivation from convolution-type solutions for certain practical weighted variational problems.
  We obtain our quasi-interpolants using Monte Carlo discretization of the pertinent integrals and establish a family of $L^p$-McDiarmid-type concentration inequalities for $1\leq p\leq \infty$, which resulted in verifiable expected error estimates for the stochastic quasi-interpolants. The $L^1$-version of these concentration inequalities
  is dynamically-independent of dimensions, which offers a partial stochastic mitigation of the so called ``curse of dimensionality". The $L^\infty$-version of these concentration inequalities strengthens the existing expected $L^\infty$-error estimates in the literature.

Motivation: 非自伴算子的谱不稳定性和模式切换使得传统特征函数学习方法效果不佳，需要一种能够稳定学习特征子空间的方法来解决参数化非自伴特征值问题。

Method: 提出深度特征子空间网络（DEN）架构，整合傅里叶神经算子、几何自适应POD基和显式带状交叉模式混合机制，学习稳定不变特征子空间映射而非单个特征函数。

Abstract: We consider operator learning for efficiently solving parametric non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problems. To overcome the spectral instability and mode switching inherent in non-selfadjoint operators, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns the stable invariant eigensubspace mapping rather than individual eigenfunctions. We proposed a Deep Eigenspace Network (DEN) architecture integrating Fourier Neural Operators, geometry-adaptive POD bases, and explicit banded cross-mode mixing mechanisms to capture complex spectral dependencies on unstructured meshes. We apply DEN to the parametric non-selfadjoint Steklov eigenvalue problem and provide theoretical proofs for the Lipschitz continuity of the eigensubspace with respect to the parameters. In addition, we derive error bounds for the reconstruction of the eigenspace. Numerical experiments validate DEN's high accuracy and zero-shot generalization capabilities across different discretizations.

Motivation: 开发一种能够同时守恒动能和螺旋度的数值方法对于准确模拟流体动力学问题非常重要，特别是在无粘极限下保持物理守恒性质。传统方法往往难以同时守恒这两个重要物理量。

Method: 采用增强Galerkin速度空间（一阶连续Galerkin空间加上网格面上的分段常数）和分段常数压力。基于对流项的旋转形式提出了两种数值格式：非线性格式和线性变体，两者都能精确保持离散螺旋度和动能。

Conclusion: 成功开发了一种同时守恒动能和螺旋度的增强Galerkin方法，该方法具有理论保证的守恒性质和数值稳定性，为流体动力学模拟提供了有效的数值工具。

Abstract: We develop an enriched Galerkin (EG) method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that conserves both kinetic energy and helicity in the inviscid limit without introducing any additional projection variables. The method employs an EG velocity space, which is the first-order continuous Galerkin space enriched with piecewise constants defined on mesh faces, together with piecewise-constant pressure. Two numerical schemes based on the rotational form of the convective term are proposed: a nonlinear scheme and a linear variant. Both schemes exactly preserve the discrete helicity and kinetic energy, and the Picard iteration maintains the conservation properties of the nonlinear scheme. We prove the conservation properties of both the methods, and establish stability and rigorous error estimates for the nonlinear scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and conservation of the proposed linear scheme.

Abstract: Defeaturing, the process of simplifying computational geometries, is a critical step in industrial simulation pipelines for reducing computational cost. Rigorous a posteriori estimators exist for the global energy-norm error introduced by geometry simplifications. However, practitioners are usually more concerned with the accuracy of specific quantities of interest (QoIs) in the solution. This paper bridges that gap by developing mathematically certified, goal-oriented a posteriori defeaturing error estimators for Poisson's equation, linear elasticity, and Stokes flow. First, we derive new reliable energy-norm estimators for features subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in linear elasticity and Stokes flow, based on existing results for Poisson's equation. Second, we formulate general energy-norm estimators for multiple negative features, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the first time. Finally, we combine these estimators with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method to obtain reliable estimates for linear QoIs and demonstrate their effectiveness across a range of numerical experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种能够处理不同流形上定义的不同函数的统一编码方法，特别是在处理变域PDE解映射等复杂问题时。

Method: 将流形和函数视为连续函数空间上的有界线性泛函，在共轭空间中基于适当的逼近基序列展开，构建流形函数编码器（MFE）。

Result: 证明了MFE在使用谱方法常用基（如勒让德多项式和傅里叶基）时能实现超代数收敛，并可扩展到不同维度的联合流形函数和不同测度的流形函数。

Conclusion: MFE为流形函数编码提供了统一框架，特别适用于变域PDE的算子学习，在2D泊松方程和3D轴承弹性问题等实际应用中表现良好。

Abstract: We propose the Manifold Function Encoder (MFE) for identifying different functions defined on different manifolds. Both a manifold in Euclidean space and a function defined on this manifold can be viewed as bounded linear functionals on a suitable space of continuous functions. From this perspective, we treat manifold functions as elements of the dual space. By expanding them in the dual space based on appropriate approximating sequence of bases, we obtain a corresponding method for encoding manifold functions, that is MFE. Especially, we prove that MFE achieves super-algebraic convergence based on smooth bases commonly used in spectral methods, such as Legendre polynomials and Fourier basis. We further extend MFE to handle more complex cases, including joint manifold functions of different dimensions and manifold functions with different measures. In addition, we show the approximation theory for MFE-based operator learning, in particular learning the solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains, together with several numerical experiments including the 2-d Poisson equation and the 3-d elasticity problem on the real-world bearing.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach for designing high-order energy-decaying schemes for Maxwell's equations in Havriliak-Negami dispersive media. It is shown that conventional convolution quadrature (CQ) methods, which rely directly on the generating function of linear multistep methods, cannot generate completely monotonic sequences beyond first-order accuracy. We rigorously prove that for any linear multistep method of second-or higher-order, the associated generating function $δ(ζ)$ cannot satisfy both that \(-δ(ζ)\) is a Pick function and that it is analytic on \((-\infty,1)\) - a key requirement for constructing completely monotonic sequences. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce a reconstruction of the generating function's structure. By strategically incorporating the theory of Pick functions, we successfully construct a second-order completely monotonic sequence. This theoretical advance leads to a discrete scheme that inherits the continuous model's energy decay property, guaranteeing unconditional stability. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rates and energy dissipation behavior of the proposed method.

Abstract: We consider the primal and dual forms of the optimality conditions for PDE-contrained optimization problems arising in Data-Driven Computational Mechanics when specialized to the reaction-diffusion context. Starting with the continuous setting, we establish well-posedness of such concomitant formulations. Then, we propose stable and consistent finite element approximations for these underlying primal and dual problems relying on the Variational MultiScale framework. For quasi-uniform finite element partitions, we investigate approximations' general properties and establish well-posedness for two canonical choices of the sub-grid scales, i.e., the Algebraic Sub-Grid Scale and Orthogonal Sub-Grid Scale. Moreover, for continuous finite element functions, we are able to move back and forth between the discrete primal and dual formulations only by changing the design of the stabilization parameters. To conclude, we stress-test the proposed approximations through a series of progressively sophisticated cases, providing both a comparative and qualitative assessment of their numerical performance.

Abstract: The construction of robust solvers for linear systems obtained from the discretization of partial differential equations using Isogeometric Analysis is challenging since the condition number of the system matrix not only grows with the reciprocal square of the grid size (for second order problems), but also exponentially with the spline degree. The Fast Diagonalization method allows the construction of a preconditioner that is robust both in grid size and spline degree. Although this method is efficient in practice, its computational complexity is superlinear in the number of degrees of freedom. In this work, we construct a variant of the Fast Diagonalization method that can exploit the Fast Fourier Transformation. Note that, because of boundary effects, a Fourier Transformation cannot diagonalize the overall problem. We circumvent this issue using a stable splitting of the spline space. The resulting preconditioner is still robust with respect to the grid size and spline degree and can be realized with a computational complexity that grows almost linearly with the number of degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: 提出的二阶IMEX方案有效克服了传统显式方法的时间步长限制，为可压缩Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes方程提供了高效稳定的数值求解方法

Abstract: We propose a second-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-stepping scheme for the isentropic, compressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations discretized on staggered (MAC) grids. The scheme is based on finite difference approximations that ensure a stable coupling among the velocity, density and phase field, with symmetric operators acting on the discretized viscosity terms.
  Standard explicit methods suffer from severe time-step restrictions due to the presence of second to fourth-order diffusion terms introduced by the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes operators. To overcome these challenges, we develop an IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme that treats the stiff terms implicitly while the convective terms are dealt with explicitly, with the advantage that only linear systems are solved at each stage.
  Numerical experiments are performed to verify the stability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper studies the approximation capacity of neural networks with an arbitrary activation function and with norm constraint on the weights. Upper and lower bounds on the approximation error of these networks are computed for smooth function classes. The upper bound is proven by first approximating high-degree monomials and then generalizing it to functions via a partition of unity and Taylor expansion. The lower bound is derived through the Rademacher complexity of neural networks. A probabilistic version of the upper bound is also provided by considering neural networks with randomly sampled weights and biases. Finally, it is shown that the assumption on the regularity of the activation function can be significantly weakened without worsening the approximation error, and the approximation upper bound is validated with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Research on the statistics of extreme events using deterministic wave group methods has largely been simplified to vessels at zero or constant speed and heading. In contrast, free-running vessels move with six degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF), leading to more complex and varied extreme response events. This paper details the extension of the Critical Wave Groups (CWG) method to free-running vessels and demonstrates that the method produces probability calculations comparable to those from a limited Monte Carlo dataset for a vessel in beam seas. This research is a critical first step in the formal validation of this free-running implementation of the CWG method.

Abstract: The interaction between shear and double-diffusive convection (DDC) in the diffusive regime (cold fresh water on top of hot salty water) plays an important role in the heat and mass transport of polar region oceans. This study computes exact coherent structures (ECS) of diffusive-regime DDC with a uniform background shear in a vertically wall-bounded flow layer. We focus on the shear-influenced regime and present two-dimensional (2D) ECS consisting of steady-state solutions and periodic orbits. The steady-state solutions include tilted convective rolls with various horizontal wavenumbers, and they are invariant under horizontal translation. All tilted convective roll states undergo saddle-node bifurcation, leading to a stable upper branch and an unstable lower branch, suggesting that they originate from the subcritical bifurcation of conduction base states. Hopf bifurcations appear on the stable upper branch of tilted convective rolls, leading to periodic orbits. Bifurcation diagrams for dimensionless parameters, including the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, and the diffusivity ratio, are established, suggesting subcritical behavior. Increasing shear strength stabilizes the 2D tilted convective roll, while these tilted convective rolls continue to exist in the limit of zero density ratio corresponding to sheared Rayleigh-Bénard convection. Extension to the three-dimensional (3D) domain leads to 3D streamwise-elongated roll solutions; one of them originates from a subcritical bifurcation of the corresponding 2D roll solution. Chaotic solutions from direct numerical simulations generally visit neighborhoods of these steady or periodic solutions, and these visits leave an imprint on the flow statistics.

Abstract: Axisymmetric waves occur across a wide range of scales. This study analyses large-scale gravity-dominated axisymmetric waves, with jet heights of up to 6 m, for which surface-tension effects are negligible. The Bond number is O(10^5) and the Weber number ranges from O(10^4) to O(10^6). Our aim is to clarify the dynamics of highly nonlinear axisymmetric jet formation, cavity collapse and the consequent generation of secondary jets. The newly developed three-dimensional framework OceanSPHysics3D, combining unsteady potential flow with smoothed particle hydrodynamics, enables full simulation of jet initiation and collapse. The computed free-surface elevations and jet evolution agree well with the experiments of McAllister et al. (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2022) and with an analytical jet-tip-angle formulation by Longuet-Higgins (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 1983). The simulations elucidate how the falling primary jet induces a secondary jet. The mechanisms forming the pre-jet trough and the post-jet cavity are fundamentally different. The pre-jet trough arises geometrically from directional focusing of the constituent waves, yielding a self-similar shape when appropriately scaled. In contrast, the post-jet cavity is formed inertially by the falling continuous jet and lacks both spatial and temporal self-similarity. Its collapse also differs: the cavity pinches off at the neck to generate upward and downward secondary jets, with local accelerations reaching approximately 150 times gravity. The primary jet scale governs the ensuing secondary-jet dynamics, including vortex-ring formation and strong vertical mixing. These findings illustrate the complexity of axisymmetric jet dynamics and demonstrate the ability of the present framework to reproduce the key coupled processes in such extreme free-surface events.

Conclusion: GIMLET框架能够灵活、结构化地发现热力学一致的本构关系，无需预定义函数库。学习到的自由能和耗散函数提供直接物理可解释性，为流体动力学模型发现提供了新途径。

Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for discovering constitutive relations in models of fluid flow and scalar transport. Our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations (gray-box discovery) under the assumption that the temporal derivative, convective transport, and pressure-gradient contributions are known. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from nonequilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, ensuring monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.

TL;DR: 开发了一种能量守恒的有限差分法，用于分析低马赫数可压缩磁流体动力学流动，无需不可压缩假设，具有优异的能量守恒特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在磁流体动力学流动中，低马赫数通常假设为不可压缩，但即使马赫数很低，它仍会影响流动和磁场。因此需要开发一种能够稳定分析低马赫数可压缩磁流体动力学流动的方法，而不使用不可压缩假设。

Method: 构建了能量守恒的有限差分法，用于分析低马赫数可压缩磁流体动力学流动，采用非保守洛伦兹力形式。该方法离散化洛伦兹力，使得保守形式和非保守形式之间的变换成立。该方案同时松弛速度、压力、密度和内能，能够获得稳定的收敛解。

Result: 通过分析四种模型验证了数值方法的准确性和收敛性。在二维和三维理想周期性无粘磁流体动力学流动分析中，动量、磁通密度和总能量在离散意义上守恒。即使在非均匀网格中，总能量也守恒。即使没有对磁通密度进行修正，磁通密度的无散条件在离散意义上也得到满足。泰勒衰减涡在磁场下的分析表明，该方法可应用于不可压缩流动，并能准确预测能量衰减趋势。在Orszag-Tang涡分析中，马赫数增加会降低涡度和电流密度的大小，压缩功比膨胀功增加更多，可压缩性影响显现，马赫数增加略微延迟了向湍流的转变。

Conclusion: 该数值方法具有优异的能量守恒特性，能够准确预测能量转换，适用于低马赫数可压缩磁流体动力学流动的稳定分析。

Abstract: In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows, incompressibility is assumed for low Mach numbers. However, even at low Mach numbers, the Mach number influences flow and magnetic fields. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method that can stably analyze low Mach number compressible MHD flows without using the incompressible assumption. This study constructs an energy-conserving finite difference method to analyze compressible MHD flows at low Mach numbers with the nonconservative Lorentz force. This analysis method discretizes the Lorentz force so that the transformation between conservative and nonconservative forms holds. This scheme simultaneously relaxes velocity, pressure, density, and internal energy, and stable convergence solutions can be obtained. In this study, we analyze four types of models and verify the accuracy and convergence of this numerical method. In the analyses of two- and three-dimensional ideal periodic inviscid MHD flows, it is clarified that momentum, magnetic flux density, and total energy are conserved discretely. The total energy is conserved even in a nonuniform grid. Even without correction for the magnetic flux density, the divergence-free condition of the magnetic flux density is satisfied discretely. Analysis of a Taylor decaying vortex under a magnetic field clarifies that the present numerical method can be applied to incompressible flows and can accurately predict the trend of energy attenuation. In the Orszag-Tang vortex analysis, an increase in Mach number reduces the magnitude of vorticity and current density. In addition, compression work increases more than expansion work, and the influence of compressibility appears. An increase in Mach number slightly delays the transition to turbulent flow. This numerical method has excellent energy conservation properties and can accurately predict energy conversion.

Abstract: Chaotic free surface flows are challenging problems to simulate numerically, mainly due to the significant changes in geometry and frequent topological changes. Methods that track the evolution of the fluid in a Lagrangian formulation are a natural choice. One such method is the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). As a hybrid particle-based and mesh-based method, PFEM leverages advantages from both approaches. The equations of motion are solved on a mesh using the finite element method and the obtained velocity field is used to displace the nodes of this mesh, considered as particles carrying all the relevant information across time steps. To avoid element distortion, the mesh is frequently re-generated. This introduces some challenges: How can the new shape of the domain be detected? How can the quality of the elements be kept acceptable? Can adaptive mesh refinement increase the accuracy and efficiency of the solver? Can PFEM simulations be performed in the presence of complex boundary geometries? In this work, three contributions to the geometry and mesh component of PFEM are introduced for three-dimensional free surface flow simulations. First, we propose a different domain reconstruction approach than the classically used alpha-shape procedure, namely through the use of the advected boundary from the previous time step as a predicate to represent the new shape of the domain. Second, an adaptive refinement procedure is proposed in two steps: refinement of the boundary surface followed by quality-based node insertion in the bulk. Third, an approach for managing boundaries in complex geometries is presented. A series of applications is shown to demonstrate the interest of the approach.

Abstract: Gallium alloys are promising materials in biomedical engineering, electronics, and wireless communications, thanks to their good conductivity, non toxicity and their ability to sustain large deformations. They can be transported in capillaries using purely electric means by continuous electrowetting (CEW). Current models of CEW-driven flows do not address the transient response to fast changes in the excitation, crucial in many applications. Here, we present a theory that describes the CEW-driven oscillatory motion of a drop of Eutectic Gallium-Indium alloy inside a capillary. We consider inertia, viscosity and the transient response of the electrical circuit consisting of the drop plus the electrolyte where it is immersed. The theory describes fairly well the experimental drop velocity and explains the existence of an optimal frequency that maximizes the velocity.
