Detailed numerical simulations are conducted using a\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach coupled with mesh adaptation\ntechniques. A Eulerian microphysical model is used to characterize contrail ice\ncrystal properties and their evolution under varying dilution conditions. The\nsetup is based on a Boeing 777-like geometry, including fuselage, wings,\nengines, and tailplane. Two microphysical activation scenarios are considered:\none incorporating adsorption-based ice nucleation and the other assuming fully\nactivated soot particles. The latter for two soot number emission indices. The\ndilution process and wake structure exhibit a strong dependence on engine\nplacement, which significantly influences plume saturation. In highly diluted\nconfigurations, enhanced early-stage mixing reduces plume temperature and\nincreases relative humidity, favoring the growth of larger ice crystals.\nDepending on the soot number concentration, vapor depletion effects may\noutweigh dilution-driven changes in water vapor availability. In\nadsorption-limited activation scenarios, increased dilution reduces the\nconcentration of sulfur species, leading to a lower activation fraction and the\nformation of smaller ice crystals. Additionally, across the scenarios, the\nmodified jet-vortex interaction alters particle distribution and their access\nto water vapor, further shaping their growth. These effects ultimately impact\nthe contrail's optical properties, particularly its optical thickness."}

MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be\nseamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will\nbe open-sourced upon publication."}

To\naddress these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework\n(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a\nself-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for\nlong-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps\nefficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short\nchain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks\nthrough complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model\niteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via\nreward-gated rejection sampling.

Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical\nproblem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic\nconvergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:\ndo models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To\nanswer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues\nto the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue\ncorpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly\nconverge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative\nto the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,\nwe observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with\ninstruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained\ncounterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence\npatterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are\nvery different."}

Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,\ndense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both\nstructural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a\nfour-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data\nfrom the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which\naccelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we\npropose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption\nquality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a\ncaption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive\nexperiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate\nmore accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing\nboth open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions."}

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph.

In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits.

Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired\nwith 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality\nbare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nthat focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that\nFFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets\nand serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks."}

We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization\nalgorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all\neleven since 2015.

Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or\nsingle-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource\nwaste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning\nframework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on\nuser-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA\ncompliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent\ninitialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that\neliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,\nand (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization\npriorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a\nself-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state\nrepresentation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA\ncompliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation\ndecisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML\nworkloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL\nachieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%\nreduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in\noverall SLA compliance compared to static baselines.

And we develop the LVSQA\ndataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected\nvideos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to\npromote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long\nvideos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.\nThe core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically\ncoherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic\nframe reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding\ncapabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to\nthe original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.\nExperimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in\nseveral long video benchmark tests.

However, these models still face\nthe inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative\ninference, which often leads to \"hallucinations\", outputs that are not grounded\nin the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these\nissues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational\ncost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit\na long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,\nyet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive\nresearch into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship\nbetween this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify\na consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input\ndiminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key\nfactor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative\nDecoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more\nimage-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with\nhigher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those\nfrom the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and\nsuppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.\nExtensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks\ndemonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and\nimproving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no\nadditional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient\nframework applicable to various models."}

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and\nsubjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results\nshow that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the\nbaseline methods."}

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic\n4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,\nand evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified\nframework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language\ninputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a\ntri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion\ntrajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and\nfine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates\ntemporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support\nstandardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse\nmetrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on\nthe nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and\ntemporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation\nand simulation.

Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to\nscale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In\nthis paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate\nnoise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the\nlimitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose\nLongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video\ngeneration. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:\n1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation\nacross clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces\nalignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual\ndegradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates\nboth dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,\ncomplemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively\nbalances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also\nintroduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100\nhigh-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,\neach lasting over one minute.

We present Trokens, a\nnovel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational\ntokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling\nstrategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and\nsemantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that\ncaptures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented\nDisplacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action\npatterns.

Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:\nusers must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve\nprotection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction\nhas severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection\nsolutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable\nExample (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using\nonly text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by\nemploying a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image\n(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce\neffective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected\ndata substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal\nretrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect\ngeneralizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning\nsettings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of \"zero-contact data\nprotection\", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their\ntextual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure."}

Current benchmarks\noften focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with\nincomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect\nreal-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal\nevaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each\ncomponent within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880\npages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4\ndocument types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data\ncontamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence\npages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.\nOur comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4\nMLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text\nand visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building\nstronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the\nover-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to\nprovide answer even without evidence support.
