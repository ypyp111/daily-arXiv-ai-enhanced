Salgado"], "title": "The spectral fractional Laplacian with measure valued right hand sides: analysis and approximation", "comment": null, "summary": "We consider the spectral definition of the fractional Laplace operator and study a basic linear problem involving this operator and singular forcing. In two dimensions, we introduce an appropriate weak formulation in fractional Sobolev spaces and prove that it is well-posed. As an application of these results, we analyze a pointwise tracking optimal control problem for fractional diffusion. We also develop a finite element scheme for the linear problem using continuous, piecewise linear functions, prove a convergence result in energy norm, and derive an error bound in $L^2(Ω)$. Finally, we propose a practical scheme based on a diagonalization technique and derive an error bound in $L^2(Ω)$ using a regularization argument."}

Our target application is the computation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output transfer functions arising from large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as Lanczos or conjugate gradients, focus on resolving individual eigenvalues of a dense discretization, while ignoring the underlying continuous spectral measure that these points approximate. We argue that it is more efficient to model the inherent branch cut of the original operator than to exhaustively resolve the artificial point spectrum induced by discretization. We place this problem in a framework, known in the physics literature as the square-root terminator. To overcome its limitations, we formulate a quadratic terminator using Kreĭn--Nudelman semi-infinite strings, with parameters chosen adaptively to maximize relative energy outflow.\n  This approach results in a low-rank modification to the (block) Lanczos matrix, dependent on $\\sqrt{s}$, with an additional $O(n)$ cost. We demonstrate significant error reductions for large-scale self-adjoint PDE discretizations in unbounded domains, including two- and three-dimensional Maxwell's equations in diffusive regimes. The method proves particularly advantageous in computing state-space solutions for wave propagation, specifically for 2D wave and 3D Maxwell's operators. Implicitly replacing the conventional Lanczos spectral decomposition with a representation in terms of the continuous Kreĭn--Nudelman spectrum, we obtain a qualitative improvement in finite-difference approximations, effectively transforming standing-wave artifacts into outgoing propagating waves."}

Chen"], "title": "A Preliminary Assessment of Coding Agents for CFD Workflows", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate the use of tool-using coding agents to automate end-to-end workflows in the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM. Building on general-purpose coding agent interfaces, we introduce a lightweight configuration that guides an agent toward tutorial reuse and log-driven repair to improve case setup and execution. We evaluate this approach on the FoamBench-Advanced benchmark, covering both tutorial-derivative and planar 2D obstacle-flow tasks. For tutorial-derivative cases, prompt guidance dramatically increases execution completion rates and reduces unnecessary tool calls. For obstacle-flow cases, stronger language models such as GPT-5.2 markedly improve mesh generation and overall task completion compared to earlier models. Our findings show that coding agents can correctly execute a range of CFD simulations with minimal configuration and that model capability significantly influences performance on tasks requiring geometry and mesh creation. These results suggest that coding agents have practical utility for automating portions of CFD workflows while highlighting areas that require further investigation."}

First, we investigate the block-diagonalization of the $z$-block circulant matrix $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\\mathcal A)$, based on this block-diagonal structure, and develop the algorithm $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}$-inv for computing the inverse of $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\\mathcal A)$. Second, we establish the equivalence between the QT-product of tensors and the product of the corresponding $z$-block circulant matrices. Based on this equivalence and in combination with the algorithm $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}$-inv, large-scale tests and scalability analysis of the Tikhonov-regularized model are conducted.\n  As a by-product of the analysis, some relevant and straightforward properties of the quaternion $z$-block circulant matrices are provided. As applications, a series of quaternion tensor decompositions under the QT-product and their corresponding $z$-block circulant matrices decompositions are obtained, including the QT-Polar decomposition, the QT-PLU decomposition, and the QT-LU decomposition. Meanwhile, the QT-SVD is rederived based on the relation between $\\mathcal A$ and $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\\mathcal A)$. Furthermore, we develop corresponding algorithms and present several large-scale tests and scalability analysis. In addition, applications in video rotation are presented to evaluate several rotation strategies based on the QT-Polar decomposition, which shows the decomposition remains stable and inter-frame consistent while accurately maintaining color reproduction."}

Enforcing orthogonality in the covariant Chu energy norm, we show that shock--turbulence interaction, often treated as a scattering source, is, in the idealized linear, inviscid setting, a near-unitary (Chu-isometric) scattering map constrained by conservation of covariant Chu-energy flux. In the canonical Shu-Osher problem, CCKD characterizes the shock as a thermo-acoustic lens, mathematically demonstrating that the transfer of entropy fluctuations into sound follows a geometric blue-shift ($k_{\\mathrm{out}}=Λk_{\\mathrm{in}}$) analogous to gravitational blue-shift. Thus, while the mean flow produces entropy across the shock, the fluctuation mapping is information-preserving on the retained subspace; practical information loss arises from noise, truncation, and model mismatch, not shock physics."}
