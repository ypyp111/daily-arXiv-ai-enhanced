Detailed numerical simulations are conducted using a\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach coupled with mesh adaptation\ntechniques. A Eulerian microphysical model is used to characterize contrail ice\ncrystal properties and their evolution under varying dilution conditions. The\nsetup is based on a Boeing 777-like geometry, including fuselage, wings,\nengines, and tailplane. Two microphysical activation scenarios are considered:\none incorporating adsorption-based ice nucleation and the other assuming fully\nactivated soot particles. The latter for two soot number emission indices. The\ndilution process and wake structure exhibit a strong dependence on engine\nplacement, which significantly influences plume saturation. In highly diluted\nconfigurations, enhanced early-stage mixing reduces plume temperature and\nincreases relative humidity, favoring the growth of larger ice crystals.\nDepending on the soot number concentration, vapor depletion effects may\noutweigh dilution-driven changes in water vapor availability. In\nadsorption-limited activation scenarios, increased dilution reduces the\nconcentration of sulfur species, leading to a lower activation fraction and the\nformation of smaller ice crystals. Additionally, across the scenarios, the\nmodified jet-vortex interaction alters particle distribution and their access\nto water vapor, further shaping their growth.

This paper focuses on\nrecovering generic orbits of functions on ${\\mathbb R}^{n}$ and the sphere\n$S^{n-1}$ under the rotation action of $SO(n)$. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover\ngeneric orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of\n$L^2({\\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and\ndiscretizing the radial direction. In particular, our main result explicitly\nbounds the number of samples in the radial direction required for recovery from\nthe degree three invariants. From an application perspective, the most\nimportant case is $SO(3)$, which arises in many scientific fields, and in\nparticular, plays a central role in leading structural biology applications\nsuch as cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy.

This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions.

Recent works have investigated the\npotential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients\nand fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning\nframeworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial\ninformation. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a\nrectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural\nNetwork (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure\nand the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control\nembedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the\nparameter $\\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind\ntunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional\nrectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero\nusing high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for\nDeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast\nspatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison\nbetween forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in\nstatistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density,\nspatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that\nembedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\\beta$ in the\nDeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting\nspatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting\nhigh-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the\nDeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information\ninput, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684DeepU-Fourier\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DeepUFNet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u77e9\u5f62\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u7ed5\u6d41\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u58c1\u538b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408UNet\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9891\u635f\u5931\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u538b\u529b\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u7a7a\u58c1\u538b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DeepUFNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408UNet\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u9891\u635f\u5931\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u6570\u03b2\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u6d1e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "DeepUFNet\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u7a7a\u58c1\u538b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u9891\u635f\u5931\u63a7\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepUFNet\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u58c1\u538b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u9891\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures\nlong-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible\ndynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate\nthat DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content\nand temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality.

NeRF achieves high-fidelity\nnovel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural\nnetworks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction\nchallenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of\nGaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more\nintuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly\nwell-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural\nRadiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the\nphotorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured\nrepresentation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance\nmodeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These\nembeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest\nGaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we\nintroduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest\nGaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a\nmulti-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.\nTogether, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as\nGaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence\nis immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of\nimplicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene\nmanipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,\nbridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity\nraw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce\nrealistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV\nscenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale\nefficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic\nLiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from\nmicroscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives\n(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the\nspatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop\nLine-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion\nrelationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP\narchitecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to\nthe prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be\nseamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will\nbe open-sourced upon publication.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIDAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aLiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u7684LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "MIDAR\u901a\u8fc7\u8f66\u8f86\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9eLiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efaRM-LoS\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u906e\u6321\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528GRU\u589e\u5f3a\u7684APPNP\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "MIDAR\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.909\u7684AUC\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e3b\u6d413D LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bCenterPoint\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MIDAR\u6210\u529f\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional\nCross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between\nmodalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.\nTo meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a\nTuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on\nfalse-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.\nDeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across\nseven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,\nrepresenting a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables\nreal-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal\nfor low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically\nvalidated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health\nworkers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,\naffordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB\ncontrol.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepGB-TB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u54b3\u55fd\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08CM-BCA\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u5e73\u8861\u635f\u5931\uff08TRBL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u7ef4\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u4f7f\u7528CM-BCA\u6a21\u5757\u548cTRBL\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb61,105\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAUROC\u4e3a0.903\uff0cF1-score\u4e3a0.851\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepGB-TB\u7ed3\u5408AI\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Accepted to the ICCV 2025 Workshop on\n  Vision-based Industrial InspectiON (VISION)", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing\ndiffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\\% higher AUROC and 10.37\\%\nhigher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a\nlightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian\nnoise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based\nscreening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity\nestimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration\nto balance privacy with generation quality. A \\renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)\naccountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit\nper-response $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.\nUnlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is\nmodel-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an\nattacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token\nlevel, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.\nExtensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG\nconsistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end\nattack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in\nRAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5TPARAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u767d\u76d2LLM\u751f\u6210\u6076\u610f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RAG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc7\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTPARAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u767d\u76d2LLM\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6076\u610f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9488\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57dfQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTPARAG\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TPARAG\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RAG\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP\nestimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its\neffectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem.

To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model\ncomprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most\nimportant memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory\nstorage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To\nincorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle\nframework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain\nfactors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates\nthe similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by\nbuilding a knowledge graph and integrating new node content.

In this\nreview, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from\nsingle-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically\nexamine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across\nreliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in\ndomains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight\npressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline\nfuture research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review\ndemonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human\noversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for\nnext-generation LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u201c\u4ee3\u7406\u5373\u6cd5\u5b98\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\uff08\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3LLM\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily focus on\nregularization techniques that leverage low-rankness and local smoothness\npriors. Recently, correlated total variation has been introduced for tensor\nrecovery, integrating these priors into a single regularization framework.\nDirect application to HSI-SR, however, is hindered by the high spectral\ndimensionality of hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a unified\ntensor regularizer, called JLRST, which jointly encodes low-rankness and local\nsmoothness priors under a subspace framework. Specifically, we compute the\ngradients of the clustered coefficient tensors along all three tensor modes to\nfully exploit spectral correlations and nonlocal similarities in HSI. By\nenforcing priors on subspace coefficients rather than the entire HR-HSI data,\nthe proposed method achieves improved computational efficiency and accuracy.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the bias introduced by the tensor nuclear norm (TNN),\nwe introduce the mode-3 logarithmic TNN to process gradient tensors.

Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection\nare either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against\ntransformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive\nGradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG\nis neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large\ntransformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a\nunified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original\ncontributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail.

(3) Reasoning\n(\"thinking\") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely\ndue to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate \"no\nrelated clause\" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are\npresent. This suggests \"laziness\" in thinking or low confidence in extracting\nrelevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of\nperformance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These\nfindings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior\nlegal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure\ncorrectness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings.

Typically, the homogenization process is qualitative in\nthe engineering community, lacking quantitative homogenization error estimates.\nIn this paper, we rigorously analyze the homogenization process of a beam\nlattice to a continuum. Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical\nproblem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. By\napplying Fourier transformations, we reduce the problem to a series of\nequations in the frequency domain. As the lattice size approaches zero, this\nyields a homogenized model in the form of a partial differential equation with\nperiodic boundary conditions. This process can be easily justified if the\nexternal conditions in the frequency domain are nonzero only at low-frequency\nmodes. However, through numerical experiments, we discover that beyond the\nlow-frequency regime, the homogenization of the beam lattice differs from\nclassical periodic homogenization theory due to the additional rotational\ndegrees of freedom in the beams. A crucial technique in our analysis is the\ndecoupling of displacement and rotation fields, achieved through a linear\nalgebraic manipulation known as the Schur complement. Through dedicated\nanalysis, we establish the coercivity of the Schur complements in both lattice\nand continuum models, which enables us to derive convergence rate estimates for\nhomogenization errors.

While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,\nwe observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with\ninstruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained\ncounterparts.

We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same\ngender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias\nand female ones alleviating it.

However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies.

To\nensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond\nefficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches\nlargely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation\nrules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we\npropose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that\nintroduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term \"Hierarchical\"\nreflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation\npipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a\nstronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical\ntaxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based\nclassification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained\nlevels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance.

To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data\ngeneration pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic\nin-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use\nreasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task\ndomains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.\nThe fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on\nour test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on\nvarious out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong\ngeneralizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToolVQA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToolVQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cToolEngine\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08DFS\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728ToolVQA\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u76847B\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-3.5-turbo\u3002", "conclusion": "ToolVQA\u548cToolEngine\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers.

The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease.

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy.

Directly applying\nexisting CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to\nthree key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders\noverlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,\nresulting in suboptimal representations.

(3) The\nprimary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the\nability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive\nrepresentation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its\nco-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,\nwe introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework\nwith semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised\nlearning on TAHGs.

A necessary enabler to this capability is to\nfind and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,\nsuch as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,\nwhereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost\nof more demanding computational resources which might not be available on\nspace-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods\nare not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of\ninterest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to\nlarge biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the\nreal-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state\nestimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a\nchaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast\nFEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed\nto leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking\nsensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours\nto their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to\nthe motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an\nattention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly\ntrained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM-SS\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LNN\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM-SS\uff09\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u7559LLM\u4f18\u52bf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM-SS\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM\nwhile enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM.

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874.

Modeling user\nbehavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has\ngained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual\nmodeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention\nscatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior\nboundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.\nTo address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing\nbehavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios.

Recent\nmachine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their\nreliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their\napplicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities\ndriven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This\napproach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with\nphysiological responses, as shown in case study.

However, when detectors learn\nnew forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,\na phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling\nthem to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while\nleaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for\naddressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant\nlimitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional\nimages, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images\nlack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when\nfeatures from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to\ndistinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the\nsame regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery\nDetection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector\n(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift\nCompensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional\nimage inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the\noverlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior\nperformance while notably reducing forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKAN\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff08KAN-CFD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u7ec4KAN\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KAN\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u8981\u6c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u578b\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u65e7\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\u3002KAN\u56e0\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u9002\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKAN-CFD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57df\u7ec4KAN\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08DG-KD\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\uff08FS-KDCP\uff09\u3002DG-KD\u4f7fKAN\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0cFS-KDCP\u907f\u514d\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "KAN-CFD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KAN\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation.

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper\nconstructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a\nnovel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation\nnetwork (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological\ninformation, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the\ngraph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps.

To address these issues,\nwe propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an\nend-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware\nprompts and concept calibration.

This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience\ntargeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser\nheterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across\nadvertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity\ncreates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).\nTraditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical\nflaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific\nconstraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,\nand 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical\nrelationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we\npropose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO\nintroduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all\nexplorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via\ntrajectory reorientation.

While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink\nreformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,\ncalled \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be\nretrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is\na dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that\ndynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be\nused to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a\nmulti-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action\nflows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate\naction estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes.

As a result, researchers have attempted to\nadapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing\nextra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the\nsuperior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their\nbase KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this\npaper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods\nand then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a\nqualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based\ngraph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an\nimproved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to\nmitigate compression issues.

It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed\nbehavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon\n(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most\nexisting approaches treat these two components as independent classification\ntasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking\ntheir inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented\nrepresentations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct\nthe egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting\nstrategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified\nPrompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component\nrepresentations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and\nnouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair\nform. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an\nattention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure\nthe prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training\nobjective, Diverse Pool Criteria.

These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats.

In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and\nProgressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text\ndescription of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images\nintroduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images\ncannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic\ndata, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches\nindividually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial\nprecision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented\nintermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more\nstable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the\nimpact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,\nensuring robust learning throughout the training process.

Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML\nworkloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL\nachieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%\nreduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in\noverall SLA compliance compared to static baselines.

The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive\nWorkload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive\nvideo generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms\nexisting long video generation models in quality and stability.

SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical\nsatellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational\noverhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows\nSolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating\n24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer\nresolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the\nCONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly\nreduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%\nin reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively\ncaptures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the\nfirst-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,\naccurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the\ntransition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SolarSeer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e24\u5c0f\u65f6\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff08NWP\uff09\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNWP\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\uff0cSolarSeer\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7AI\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u5386\u53f2\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u5230\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "SolarSeer\u5229\u7528AI\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u548c\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "SolarSeer\u6bd4HRRR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1127.28%\uff08\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548c15.35%\uff081800\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471500\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SolarSeer\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Current low-light image enhancement\n(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping\nnetworks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling\nunder extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on\nsimplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention.

Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to\nclient devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These\nclassifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the\nfoundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct\naccess to user data.

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations.

Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach\nintegrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to\ncapture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural\ncoherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,\nincluding KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly\nquantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both\nspatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we\nconduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a\nsynthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and\nother state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual\nquality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in\nlow-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution\ncharacteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically\nconsistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent\nlearning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with\npromising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and\nmedical image synthesis.

Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning\n(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and\nlimited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained\nFoundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a\npotential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,\nwith a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we\npropose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical\nimage analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets\nunder different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation\ntasks from diverse medical modalities.

However, the extremely slow\ninference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based\ntalking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully\ndesigned Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient\ntalking head synthesis.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and\nassociation (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each\ninstance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a\ndistribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the\ncurrent domain into the domain-specific representations with the different\ndomain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,\nwe propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the\nunified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further\nmitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)\nmechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly\nmodel inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,\ndistribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current\ndomain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,\nimproving adaptation capacity.

Traditional methods\nlike capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established\nbut labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB\nimagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys\nwere conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and\nNovember 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.\nFlight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and\nan algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.\nThis setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,\nminimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing\nroe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually\nannotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square\nkilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:\nnaive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative\nbinomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was\ncalculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based\nmethods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,\nexcept in one area in October.

While recent\nadvances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action\nrecognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points\nto track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a\nnovel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational\ntokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling\nstrategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and\nsemantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that\ncaptures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented\nDisplacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action\npatterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with\nsemantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action\nrecognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),\nKinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.
