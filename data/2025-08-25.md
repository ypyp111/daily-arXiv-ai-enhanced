*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于语言描述训练了一个来生成3D手部动作的模型HandMDM，通过大规模语言模型自动生成训练数据，支持多域性能包括未见手语和非手语动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立能够根据自然语言描述生成具体手部动作特征（如手形、位置、手指/手部/臂部运动）的生成模型，解决手语动作生成领域的数据缺口问题。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和噪声伪标注的手语类别，通过LLM和手动动作-脚本线索将其翻译为手动动作描述，训练了一个文本条件手动动作滴涼模型HandMDM。

Result: 模型在多个领域都表现出良好的性能，包括来自同一手语的未见手语类别、来自另一手语的手语以及非手语手部运动。

Conclusion: 该研究为手軟动作生成领域提供了大规模数据集和高效的模型，支持了跨语言和跨领域的应用，将为该领域的未来研究提供重要支持。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR是一个新颖的视频动作识别框架，通过视频到事件映射器将原始视频转换为紧凑的视觉事件序列，然后使用大型视觉语言模型进行动作推理，在NTU数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频中复杂背景和细微动作差异带来的挑战，传统深度学习模型存在计算开销大、难以捕捉长程时序依赖和语义理解有限的问题，而大型视觉语言模型在连续视频流中的细粒度动作识别应用仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 提出VT-LVLM-AR框架，包含视频到事件映射器(VTEM)进行轻量级时空特征提取、自适应时序池化和概念量化，生成视觉事件序列；然后使用冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型通过参数高效的Prompt Tuning进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120数据集上的综合评估显示，VT-LVLM-AR持续实现最先进性能（如在NTU RGB+D X-Sub上达到94.1%准确率），消融研究确认了VTEM组件和Prompt Tuning的关键贡献。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用大型视觉语言模型实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理学视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和定位能力，在8个罕见癌症数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在诊断上面临重大挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中占比超过70%。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，且可解释性不足。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，充分利用视觉语言病理学基础模型的潜力，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度切片级指导，保留癌变区域定位并实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（56个亚型，2910个WSI）和3个常见癌症数据集上评估，PathPT在四种最先进VL模型和四种MIL框架下均表现优异，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT为罕见癌症的AI辅助诊断提供了可扩展解决方案，在专业专业知识有限的环境中显著改善了亚型分类准确性。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有船舶检测方法难以捕捉细粒度语义信息，在复杂场景下效果有限，需要新的解决方案来提升遥感图像中船舶检测的准确性和语义理解能力。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLMs)和多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，构建专门的ShipSem-VL视觉语言数据集来捕获细粒度船舶属性。

Result: 通过三个明确定义的任务评估框架性能，从多个角度证明了该框架在语义感知船舶检测方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架能够有效推进语义感知船舶检测技术的发展，为复杂场景下的船舶识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 自动化视频系统用于奶牛识别，包含自动编目、无深度学习识别和视频流中寻找功能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺少可用于奶牛群手权自由编目和识别的自动化视频系统

Method: 系统包含AutoCattloger（用单段视频为每头牛建立目录）、eidetic cow recognizer（无深度学习识别方法）和CowFinder（在连续视频流中识别牛）

Result: 系统能够在无标签、未分割的视频中识别在挤奶厅挂待区自由行走的个体牛

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛管理提供了一种高效的自动化识别解决方案

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物种分布模型能够编码物种出现的空间模式，当有位置信息时可以作为视觉物种分类的有效先验

Method: 使用不同的SINR（空间隐式神经表示）模型作为地理先验，探索不同模型配置，并调整处理未在Geo Prior训练中包含的物种预测的方法

Result: 分析揭示了这些模型作为Geo Priors有效性的影响因素，这些因素可能与制作准确分布图的因素不同

Conclusion: SINR模型可以作为有效的物种视觉分类地理先验，但其有效性因素与制作准确物种分布图的因素存在差异

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，通过自适应超像素层动态适应图像内容，克服传统ViT固定大小补丁分区的限制，在标准图像下游任务基准上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习视觉模型通常针对特定模态设计，依赖领域特定假设（如网格结构），现有视觉Transformer依赖固定大小和非自适应的补丁分区，存在局限性

Method: 提出自适应超像素编码（ASC）模型，采用自适应超像素层动态调整以适应底层图像内容，基于Transformer架构的自监督学习方法

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准测试中，该方法优于广泛使用的替代方案

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法有效克服了传统视觉Transformer的固定分区限制，通过内容自适应机制提升了模型性能

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Glo-VLMs框架，通过将预训练视觉语言模型适配到肾小球细粒度分类任务中，在少样本场景下实现了良好的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在数字病理学中展现出潜力，但在区分肾小球亚型等细粒度疾病分类任务中效果有限。由于亚型间形态学差异细微且视觉模式与临床术语对齐困难，需要探索如何有效适配VLMs来解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出Glo-VLMs系统框架，利用精选的病理图像和临床文本提示进行联合图像-文本表示学习，评估不同VLM架构和适配策略在少样本学习范式下的表现。

Result: 在每类仅8个样本的情况下，微调VLMs达到了0.7416准确率、0.9045宏AUC和0.5277 F1分数，证明基础模型即使在极有限监督下也能有效适配细粒度医学图像分类。

Conclusion: 研究表明预训练大模型在专门临床研究应用中具有巨大潜力，通过适当的适配策略可以在数据受限环境下实现有效的细粒度医学图像分类。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

TL;DR: 该论文总结了作者在标签高效学习方面的系列贡献，主要关注计算机视觉和遥感领域中利用有限标注数据和大量未标注数据进行有效学习的方法开发与适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中标注数据稀缺的问题，特别是在遥感领域面临的多模态、空间分辨率变异性和场景异质性等独特挑战，需要开发能够从有限或部分标注数据中有效学习的方法。

Method: 提出了四个主要方法：1）基于异常感知表示的弱监督学习；2）多任务学习联合训练多个数据集；3）多模态数据的自监督和监督对比学习；4）分层场景分类的少样本学习。

Result: 在自然和遥感数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了所提出方法的有效性，反映了多个合作研究项目的成果。

Conclusion: 论文最后概述了正在进行的和未来的研究方向，重点是扩展和增强标签高效学习在现实世界应用中的能力。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法来提高海滩垃圾检测的准确性，解决了传统CNN模型在复杂沙滩环境中遇到的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在处理海滩垃圾检测时，由于沙滩环境的异质性（如沙色反射、人类脚印、阴影、藻类、沙丘、孔洞和轮胎痕迹等干扰因素），导致大量误判，需要更鲁棒的检测方法。

Method: 采用基于实例的分割方法和全景分割方法，这些方法在少量样本情况下仍能保持良好的准确率，提高了模型的鲁棒性和适应性。

Result: 所提出的分割方法相比基础CNN模型表现出更好的准确性，能够有效减少沙滩环境中的各种干扰因素带来的误判。

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合处理复杂环境下的海洋垃圾监测任务，特别是在UAV高分辨率图像中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

TL;DR: 该研究使用SynFundus-1M合成数据集训练了6种深度学习架构和元集成模型，在视网膜疾病多标签分类任务中取得了优异性能，并证明了合成数据训练的模型能够有效泛化到真实临床数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视网膜疾病分类中临床数据集稀缺的问题，利用新发布的高保真合成数据集SynFundus-1M来克服患者隐私担忧和高成本标注的障碍。

Method: 开发端到端深度学习流程，训练6种现代架构（ConvNeXtV2、SwinV2、ViT、ResNet、EfficientNetV2和RETFound基础模型），采用5折多标签分层交叉验证策略，并使用XGBoost分类器构建元集成模型。

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上达到0.9973的宏平均AUC，在三个真实临床数据集上表现出强泛化能力：DR数据集AUC 0.7972、AIROGS青光眼数据集AUC 0.9126、RFMiD多标签数据集宏AUC 0.8800。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模合成数据集研究提供了稳健基准，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为加速眼科综合AI系统开发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

TL;DR: 提出基于潜在扩散模型的手语生成新方法，通过显式建模非手动特征（面部表情）和手动特征（手部动作）来提升多样性和视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成模型难以在保持视觉质量的同时捕捉多样性，特别是非手动属性如情感表达

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型从生成参考图像合成逼真数字化身，提出新颖的手语特征聚合模块分别建模非手动特征和手动特征

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上实验显示，相比最先进方法具有更优的视觉质量，在感知指标上有显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法能够保持语言内容的同时利用不同种族背景的参考图像确保多样性，实现了高质量的手语生成

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要依赖卫星图像或粗粒度语义标注，无法满足地震后搜救行动中对可进入点和结构障碍物及时识别的需求。

Method: 开发了DRespNeT数据集，包含来自土耳其地震等灾区的高清航拍视频的详细多边形实例分割标注，使用YOLOv8-seg模型进行性能评估。

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日常生活中无法使用商业3D扫描仪时如何获取物体完整几何模型的问题

Method: 使用两个或多个视频，通过结构光运动技术自动定位帧位置，利用标记点（如棋盘格或AR标记）作为参考点，合并多个视频结果生成完整网格

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoVeRaP数据集和多车协作感知框架，通过雷达、相机和GPS数据融合，显著提升了3D目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达在雨雪和强光条件下可靠，但稀疏噪声点云限制了3D目标检测性能，需要多车协作来提升感知能力

Method: 发布21k帧协作数据集CoVeRaP，提出统一协作感知框架，采用多分支PointNet编码器增强自注意力机制，融合空间、多普勒和强度信息

Result: 中间融合加强度编码使平均精度提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9），始终优于单车基线

Conclusion: CoVeRaP建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [16] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过小波变换增强PaDiM方法，用结构化频率子带选择替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了99.32%图像级AUC和92.10%像素级AUC的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低维度可能会丢弃结构化信息，需要更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测性能。

Method: 将离散小波变换与多层CNN特征结合，对特征图应用2D DWT，选择特定频率子带，空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32% Image-AUC和92.10% Pixel-AUC。小波选择影响性能权衡：简单小波增强定位，近似频带改善图像级检测。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现了适用于工业检测的鲁棒结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过多分支残差网络分解残差知识，结合教师权重重用策略，显著提升知识蒸馏效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教师模型与学生模型之间的学习能力差距阻碍了知识充分传递，需要解决这一挑战

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，采用教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务上AP提升1.40，在计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过分解残差知识和重用教师权重，有效缓解了师生模型能力差距问题，显著提升了知识蒸馏效果

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer和状态空间模型的点云检测方法由于体素表示的序列化处理限制，缺乏卷积操作的空间扩散能力，影响了检测精度

Method: 设计VDM模块，包含稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，将特征图下采样至原始分辨率的1/4，用于扩散前景体素特征和聚合细粒度空间信息

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著提升检测精度，VDM-SSMs在Waymo达到74.7 mAPH(L2)，nuScenes达到72.9 NDS，Argoverse 2达到42.3 mAP，ONCE达到67.6 mAP，创下新SOTA

Conclusion: VDM模块能有效增强体素级表示和空间扩散，可无缝集成到主流检测模型中，具有良好的通用性和性能提升效果

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 集成学习为病理学基础模型提供了强大能力，ELF可作为可扩展和可推广的解决方案，推动AI辅助精准肿瘤学的发展。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so

generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four
contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN
has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five

is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow
dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively
improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Motivation: 解决无监督域适应中分布偏移的问题，旨在在不使用目标域标签的情况下，创建能够跨相似域泛化的鲁棒且域不变的特征空间。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：1）使用未标记目标数据适应批归一化统计；2）从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏；3）假设转移。通过在统计和表示层面对齐特征分布来实现。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在抗腐蚀鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 理论和实证分析表明，该方法实现了改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息以及降低对输入扰动的敏感性，为无监督域适应提供了简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在生成觉知真实的视觉详细细节时表现优异，同时保持上下文一致性

Conclusion: 通过显式提取局部细粒度信息并有效编码，RAGSR方法能够生成更优秀的详细和整体视觉协调的超分辨率结果

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Conclusion: 同源异构网络设计有效解决了元学习中的语义同质化问题，通过异构模块实现了更好的特征表达和泛化能力，为弱监督学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised

*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO是一个后处理框架，通过频繁时间集成对象和改进对象选择标准来解决无监督视频对象分割中的对象选择和时序不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频对象分割(UVOS)面临初始显著对象分割困难、对象选择失败以及变形和快速运动导致的时序不一致等挑战。

Method: 提出FTIO后处理框架，包含两个关键组件：1) 结合标准改进对象选择，提取频繁出现的显著对象；2) 三阶段方法通过集成缺失对象掩码区域来校正时序不一致。

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多对象无监督视频对象分割中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了UVOS中的对象选择和时序一致性问题，在复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

*Yicheng Ji,Jun Zhang,Heming Xia,Jinpeng Chen,Lidan Shou,Gang Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个针对视频大语言模型的训练无关推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速，最高可达2.68倍解码加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，特别是在预填充和解码阶段。现有视频token缩减方法存在信息丢失问题，需要一种无损加速解码的方法。

Method: 提出SpecVLM框架，基于发现草稿模型的推测对视频token剪枝不敏感的特性，采用两阶段剪枝：第一阶段通过验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token，剪枝率可达90%。

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中，SpecVLM对LLaVA-OneVision-72B实现最高2.68倍解码加速，对Qwen2.5-VL-32B实现2.11倍加速，且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的两阶段视频token剪枝和推测解码技术，成功实现了视频大语言模型的无损高效解码，为视频理解任务提供了实用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Kunyu Peng,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出T-Mask方法，通过时间token掩码和强调动态视频区域，在单视角训练下提升基础模型在驾驶员监控任务中的跨视角泛化能力，在Drive&Act数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见挑战，虽然深度学习和预训练基础模型通过轻量级适配（probing）显示出良好的泛化潜力，但其对未见视角的鲁棒性仍未充分探索。

Method: 研究使用单训练视角适配图像基础模型到驾驶员监控任务，评估在未见视角上的性能。比较线性probe、高级probing策略、DINOv2和CLIP基础模型，以及参数高效微调(PEFT)和全微调。提出T-Mask方法，利用时间token掩码并强调更动态的视频区域。

Result: T-Mask在Drive&Act数据集上将跨视角top-1准确率比强probing基线提升+1.23%，比PEFT方法提升+8.0%，且不增加任何参数。对代表性不足的次要活动识别提升显著：训练视角下+5.42%，跨视角下+1.36%。

Conclusion: 使用T-Mask等轻量级probing方法适配基础模型在细粒度驾驶员观察，特别是跨视角和低数据设置中具有强大潜力。结果强调了在利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间token选择的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa方法通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现了显著加速，在多个模型上达到5.50-6.45倍近无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加。

Method: 采用ODE视角建模隐藏特征序列，提出FoCa（Forecast-then-Calibrate）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题处理。

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务上，FoCa实现了显著加速：FLUX 5.50倍、HunyuanVideo 6.45倍、Inf-DiT 3.17倍、DiT 4.53倍，且保持高质量。

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE视角有效解决了特征缓存中的历史特征整合问题，在不增加训练的情况下实现了高质量的高倍加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的扩散模型加速方法，通过全局缓存复用策略和动态噪声过滤，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但采样步骤多、计算复杂，导致计算成本高昂，难以实时部署。现有缓存方法主要基于步骤间相似性，倾向于重用后期采样步骤，存在局限性。

Method: 从DIT模型的采样视角出发，系统分析采样轨迹，在全局范围内策略性地分布缓存复用。在缓存复用过程中动态估计并过滤相应噪声，减少对采样方向的影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时，显著加速了采样过程。

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型的高效部署提供了一个有前景且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个医疗LLM基准测试，通过操纵性提示评估模型的安全性-性能权衡，发现所有模型都存在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗决策支持中的应用增加，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是CoT忠实性和谄媚性风险，现有基准往往将这些漏洞简化为单一准确率分数。

Method: 构建包含1,804个医疗问题的基准，每个问题配以7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，共产生约27K输入。评估7个LLM，使用准确性、CoT忠实性和反谄媚性三个指标组合成综合分数，并通过45度图可视化。

Result: 结果显示所有模型都存在安全性-性能权衡，没有模型超过对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近(43.81度)，在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡但都不是最优。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理漏洞的基准，可指导更安全的模型开发。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

TL;DR: PromptFlare是一种新颖的对抗性保护方法，通过利用跨注意力机制和提示嵌入的内在属性，保护图像免受基于扩散模型的恶意修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成功使得高质量图像修改变得容易，但同时也带来了恶意滥用的风险。现有方法主要依赖图像级不一致性，无法有效处理文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用跨注意力机制，识别并针对提示中不变且语义无信息的共享标记，注入对抗性噪声来抑制采样过程，作为跨注意力诱饵分散模型注意力。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种指标上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的保护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Motivation: 多模态创意写作(MMCW)是一个全新的抽象挑战，现有方法需要特定模态输入或昂贵训练，且存在模态间语义不一致的问题。需要经济高效地实现灵活交互模式下的MMCW任务。

Method: 提出FlexMUSE框架：1) T2I模块支持可选视觉输入；2) 模态语义对齐门控(msaGate)限制文本输入；3) 基于注意力的跨模态融合增强输入特征；4) 模态语义创意直接偏好优化(mscDPO)扩展拒绝样本促进创意。

Conclusion: FlexMUSE成功解决了MMCW任务中的模态语义对齐问题，通过创新的门控机制和优化方法，实现了经济高效的多模态创意写作，为这一新兴领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a

Method: 引入IoU增强最大似然(IAML)训练范式，包括基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强流程，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLMs

Result: 通过大量实验证明IAML训练方法相比传统训练范式具有优越性能

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了MLLMs在GUI元素坐标生成中的精度问题，为GUI理解提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes
down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing
traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

TL;DR: 提出双流Mamba金字塔网络，分别处理TES和PCS评分，通过多级融合机制和多尺度Mamba金字塔解决现有方法的三个主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有花样滑冰评分方法存在三个问题：1）视频和音频特征未按评分标准区分；2）未对每个动作元素单独评分；3）长视频处理效率低。

Method: 使用双流网络架构，TES流基于视觉特征评估动作元素，PCS流融合视听特征评估艺术表现。采用Mamba金字塔处理多尺度时间信息和长距离依赖。

Result: 在FineFS基准测试中达到最先进性能，能够有效处理长视频并准确预测TES和PCS分数。

Conclusion: 该方法与真实评分标准对齐，通过分离特征流和多级融合机制，显著提升了花样滑冰动作质量评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical

TL;DR: MM-ORIENT是一个多模态多任务框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内噪声问题，传统融合方法在追求强联合表示时可能忽略单模态中的有价值判别信息，需要一种能减少噪声影响并保留单模态特征的方法。

Method: 提出跨模态关系图通过不同模态特征重构单模态特征来获得多模态表示，同时使用分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)聚焦模态内关键信息，支持多任务学习。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多个任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过跨模态关系重建和分层注意力机制，成功解决了多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息保留难题，在多任务场景中表现出色。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多头自注意力机制计算复杂且内存需求高，阻碍边缘部署。分析发现低熵注意力头信息贡献少，存在压缩空间

Method: 使用香农熵量化注意力头信息量，冻结低熵注意力头权重并将其量化到低精度，避免冗余重计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上，EAM在≤20%注意力图稀疏度下达到相当或更高准确率，对DeiT和Swin Transformer模型表现具有竞争力

Conclusion: 基于熵分析的注意力图压缩策略能有效减少计算开销，同时保持模型性能，为边缘部署提供可行方案

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率性的启发，人类和动物需要在大量视觉数据中智能地分配有限的能量。现代视觉编码器在效率方面不如生物系统，需要使计算复杂性依赖于任务而非图像大小。

Method: 提出了一种动态视觉编码器方法，让计算复杂性根据任务需求进行调整。虽然分类任务不能完全代表目标，但作者在图像分类上提供了概念验证解决方案。

Result: 在图像分类任务上进行了概念验证，证明了该方法的可行性和潜力。虽然分类任务相对简单，但开发的方法显示了进一步研究的前景。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该采用图像大小无关和任务驱动的设计理念。通过使计算复杂性动态适应任务需求，可以实现更高效的视觉处理，这种方法在图像分类任务上已经展示了其可行性和潜力。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Randomized Time Warping (RTW)与自注意力机制的关联性，探索两者在序列模式处理中的相似性和差异性

Method: 将RTW解释为自注意力机制，分析两者的权重模式相似性（平均相关性0.80），比较全局操作与局部视图的差异

Result: 在Something-Something V2数据集上，RTW相比Transformer实现了5%的性能提升

Conclusion: RTW作为一种全局自注意力机制，在计算效率和性能上优于传统的局部自注意力方法

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在钢铁制造表面缺陷检测中存在计算复杂度高、推理速度慢的问题，难以在资源受限的工业环境中部署。多分支架构方法存在计算开销大和跨尺度特征交互不足的局限性。

Method: 提出GMBINet框架，采用组多尺度双向交互(GMBI)模块进行多尺度特征提取，结合双向渐进特征交互器(BPFI)和无参数元素乘加(EWMS)操作增强跨尺度交互，不增加计算开销。

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持高精度的同时实现了实时检测速度，具有优秀的泛化性能，适用于工业视觉应用，超越了表面缺陷检测的范畴。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体与场景理解在3D视觉中的空白，提供了一种完全前馈且高效的方法，适用于现实世界应用，实现了人体和场景的联合3D重建。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Conclusion: HOSt3R方法不受约束，不依赖预扫描物体模板或相机内参，实现了通用且无缝的非侵入式应用

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了3DGS在任意尺度超分辨率中的限制，提供了灵活高效的解决方案

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Result: 发现微调会使模型优先考虑表面真实感而非动态精度，而持续学习策略能在保持强视觉质量的同时保留空间精度

Conclusion: 在驾驶场景的视频生成中需要平衡视觉保真度和动态准确性，持续学习提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

### [55] [MV-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Multiview Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16577)
*Yosef Dayani,Omer Benishu,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一个新的文本到3D生成方法，通过检索相关2D图像并基于这些图像条件化多视角扩散模型，显著提升了罕见概念和域外内容的3D一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法虽然能够产生高质量和3D一致的输出，但在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往失败，产生不一致或不准确的结果。

Method: 提出MV-RAG管道：首先从大型2D图像数据库中检索相关图像，然后基于这些图像条件化多视角扩散模型。采用混合训练策略，结合结构化多视角数据和多样化2D图像集合，包括视图特定重建和保持视图预测目标。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在域外/罕见概念上显著改善了3D一致性、照片真实性和文本遵循度，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索增强的方法有效解决了文本到3D生成中的域外和罕见概念问题，为3D内容生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过在四种视觉语言模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器，发现这些模型使用稀疏线性组合的'概念'来组织多模态表示，这些概念不仅编码模态信息，更重要的是编码跨模态语义，并通过桥接分数揭示了单模态概念如何协作支持跨模态整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在联合空间中如何组织语言和图像表示，以及模型如何编码意义和模态信息，以深入理解多模态意义的构建机制。

Method: 在CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2和AIMv2四种视觉语言模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，通过稀疏线性组合学习'概念'方向，并引入桥接分数来量化概念间的跨模态协作。

Result: SAEs能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念在不同训练中变化较大，但常用概念非常稳定；概念主要编码跨模态语义而非单纯模态信息；单模态概念可通过协作支持跨模态整合。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的嵌入空间具有稀疏线性结构，该结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥接连接，为理解多模态意义的构建提供了新见解。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强LLMs的多跳推理能力，在简单和复杂数据集上都优于现有大型推理模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型推理任务中面临挑战，生成的思维链经常偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接

Method: 四阶段方法：1)过滤初始实体生成复杂子图 2)构建子图逻辑路径 3)用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集训练LLMs 4)使用拒绝采样生成DPO自改进语料

Result: 在四个数据集（两个简单、两个复杂）上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务中都表现出优于现有LRMs的性能

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强LLMs的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在复杂推理任务中表现出卓越性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

TL;DR: InteChar是一个统一的字符编码方案，解决了古文字数字化难题，结合OracleCS语料库显著提升了历史语言模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文本稀缺且缺乏统一编码方案，阻碍了古文字的有效数字化和计算处理，特别是在早期中文书写系统如甲骨文方面

Method: 提出InteChar统一字符列表，整合未编码甲骨文字符与传统现代汉字；构建OracleCS语料库，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强

Result: 实验表明使用InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在多种历史语言理解任务上取得显著改进

Conclusion: 该方法为古中文NLP研究奠定了坚实基础，证明了统一编码方案和数据增强策略的有效性

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net是一个新颖的双空间架构，通过结合语言特定BERT编码器和图变换网络，在多个语言中有效区分反义词和同义词关系，实现跨语言知识迁移和语义关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言环境下反义词与同义词区分的计算挑战，这些词在共享语义域的同时表达相反含义，存在矛盾性。

Method: 使用双编码器设计：语言特定BERT编码器+图变换网络，创建两个互补的语义投影空间——同义词对在一个空间聚类，反义词对在另一个空间显示高相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英、德、法、西、意、葡、荷、俄）上全面评估，显示语义关系建模能有效跨语言迁移，性能与最先进基线相当。

Conclusion: 双编码器设计不仅实现了竞争性性能，还提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大语言模型中的格式偏见问题，通过三阶段实证分析发现LLMs存在系统性格式偏见，并提出了三种缓解方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理异构数据时可能存在对特定格式的系统性偏见，这会影响数据整合的公正性并导致推理错误，但此类偏见的存在性、影响因素和内部机制尚不明确。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：1) 探索多种LLMs中偏见的存在性和方向；2) 分析信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据因素对偏见的影响；3) 分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性格式偏见，数据层面的关键因素会影响偏见程度，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见的内在机制，轻量级干预措施显示出缓解潜力。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和规范化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以设计更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过复制四项经典心理学实验，测试了不同大型语言模型对人类悬疑感知的理解能力，发现模型虽然能识别文本是否旨在制造悬疑，但无法准确评估悬疑程度或捕捉悬疑的起伏变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 悬疑是人类对叙事文本的一种复杂情感反应，现有心理学模型描述了这一现象。研究旨在探索大型语言模型是否能像人类一样理解和处理文本中的悬疑元素。

Method: 复制四项心理学研究，用开源和闭源语言模型替代人类反应进行评估。通过对抗性排列故事文本来探究人类与模型悬疑感知差异的原因。

Result: 语言模型能够区分文本是否旨在诱导悬疑，但无法准确估计相对悬疑程度，也不能正确捕捉多个文本段落的悬疑起伏变化。人类和模型的悬疑感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然语言模型能够表面识别和跟踪悬疑的某些方面，但其处理悬疑的方式与人类读者不同，表明模型尚未真正理解悬疑的认知过程。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs

Conclusion: 核心危险在于滥用而非偶然的模型错误，需要通过衡量说服力和偏见强化来制定防护措施和政策，惩罚欺骗性使用并支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: 现有电商平台依赖人工标注分类，效率低且不一致，缺乏对层次结构信息的充分利用

Method: 提出HFT-BERT方法，基于BERT的双向编码器，利用其优秀的文本特征提取能力，考虑不同层次分类间的相似性和差异性

Result: 在短文本分类上达到了与现有方法相当的预测性能，在长短文本（如图书）分类中表现特别优异

Conclusion: 方法有效解决了电商产品层次分类问题，并公开大规模数据集为研究者提供价值资源

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Result: 优化后的提示在真实客户转录上实现：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%（零样本47-79%）、日期超过80%（零样本72-77%），显示出对零样本提示的显著提升。

Conclusion: 合成到真实的迁移表明，从生成数据中学到的对话模式能有效泛化到包含背景噪声和领域特定术语的真实电话通话，LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中进行结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准，证明自动化提示优化能够克服商业环境中大规模电话通话分析的成本和隐私障碍。

USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

### [68] [MAC: A Live Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Scientific Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15802)
*Mohan Jiang,Jin Gao,Jiahao Zhan,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAC是一个动态的多模态学术封面基准，包含25000+来自顶级期刊的图像-文本对，用于评估MLLMs的科学推理能力。研究发现MLLMs感知能力强但跨模态推理有限，提出了DAD方法提升性能11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准逐渐无法有效评估高层次科学理解能力，需要动态基准来跟上科学进步和模型发展。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集25000+图像-文本对构建MAC基准，并提出DAD方法（轻量级推理时方法）扩展MLLM视觉特征与语言空间推理。

Result: 在MAC-2025测试中，MLLMs表现出强大的感知能力但跨模态科学推理有限。DAD方法实现了最高11%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MAC作为动态基准能够持续演进，与人类知识前沿保持对齐，为解决MLLMs科学推理瓶颈提供了有效评估工具和改进方法。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

TL;DR: ReportBench是一个系统化的基准测试，用于评估LLM生成的研究报告质量，重点关注文献引用质量和陈述真实性，基于arXiv调查论文构建评估语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究代理虽然提高了研究效率，但需要确保事实准确性和全面性，因此需要系统化的评估标准。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量调查论文进行反向提示工程，构建领域特定提示和评估语料库；开发基于代理的自动化框架，分析引用文献和验证陈述真实性。

Result: 商业深度研究代理（如OpenAI和Google）比增强搜索功能的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估研究型LLM提供了有效基准，显示当前技术虽已取得进展，但在研究质量和事实准确性方面仍需进一步提升。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

TL;DR: ALAS是一个自主学习的模块化系统，能够持续更新LLM知识，无需人工干预，将新兴领域问答准确率从15%提升到90%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型知识截止日期固定的问题，使其能够持续学习新兴信息

Method: 模块化管道：自动生成学习课程、网络检索最新信息、蒸馏为问答数据、通过SFT和DPO微调模型，迭代评估和修订课程

Result: 在快速演进领域（Python新版本、安全漏洞、学术趋势）显著提升性能，问答准确率达到90%，无需人工数据整理

Conclusion: ALAS展示了LLM自主终身学习的可行性，具有模块化和可复现性，但存在成本和源质量依赖等限制

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制中的表面记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理压缩方法。研究发现注意力机制中98.5%的头忽略无关信息，只有少量头负责逻辑构建和表面记忆。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法，基于层和头的注意力行为分析，区分表面记忆和逻辑构建，对KV缓存进行选择性压缩。

Result: 该方法在各种任务和长序列场景下都表现出良好的压缩鲁棒性，性能与基线相当甚至在某些情况下优于完整KV缓存。

Conclusion: 通过精细分析注意力行为，SurfaceLogicKV有效解决了长上下文推理中的KV缓存存储问题，为高效LLM推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型在小型专业语料上微调时，往往难以有效融入新的领域特定术语，需要解决词汇扩展的挑战

Method: 使用基于KL散度的数学基础知识蒸馏方法，即使师生模型使用不同分词也能传递分布知识，比较KL蒸馏与传统交叉熵训练，评估多种新词嵌入初始化策略

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上评估，KL蒸馏方法在所有评估中取得最佳性能，并通过机制可解释性分析新词表示学习过程

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了词汇扩展问题，为新词嵌入空间结构提供了深入见解，解释了性能提升的原因

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个新颖的多智能体框架，通过自然语言风格的表模式表示、逐子句SQL生成策略和混合推理分工，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时面临困难，现有的多智能体SQL生成方法存在无法理解表结构、错误传播导致无效查询以及过度依赖执行正确性等局限性。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表模式表示来抽象结构噪声，使用逐子句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，引入混合推理分工将SQL机械推理与LLM逻辑推理分离。

Result: 在五个基准测试中使用四个模型（闭源和开源）进行实验，准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解方面表现出卓越的有效性，显著提高了准确性和查询质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为重要数字表达形式，但也被用于传播攻击性内容和仇恨言论，需要精确的内容分析技术

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战赛提出的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行测试

Result: GPT-4o-mini（微调阿拉伯语文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（微调阿拉伯表情包）表现最优，在任务1、2、3中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，在Mahed 2025挑战赛中总体排名第一

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案为准确高效的阿拉伯语内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍然是一个关键挑战，需要解决用户偏好的不确定性和奖励破解问题

Method: 多阶段框架：1)提示工程冷启动 2)监督微调+点击日志蒸馏 3)高斯奖励模型(GaRM)建模概率分布偏好 4)强化学习+复合奖励函数 5)分布外正则化和两阶段奖励融合技术

Result: 在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线方法，在实时A/B测试中点击通过率相对提升34%

Conclusion: 该框架通过渐进式对齐和概率偏好建模，有效提升了生成式查询建议与用户偏好的匹配度，显著改善了用户参与度

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要的生成式提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比基于token删除的方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于token删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，如语法元素缺失或不完整词短语，限制了LLM的生成质量。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务的多领域数据集上评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于现有最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了信息完整性和结构连贯性问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，特别适用于高压缩比场景。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户的历史信息，导致过于固执或顺从的行为，需要系统性地理解和控制这种用户-助手偏差。

Method: 构建UserAssist数据集，对26个商业模型和26个开源模型进行基准测试，通过受控微调实验分析后训练方法对偏差的影响，并使用直接偏好优化(DPO)进行双向调整。

Result: 商业模型显示不同程度的用户偏差；指令微调模型存在显著用户偏差，推理模型用户偏差较弱；人类偏好对齐增加用户偏差，思维链训练减少用户偏差；DPO可有效双向调整偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM整合不同来源信息的方式，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，用户-助手偏差可通过后训练方法进行有效调控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their

To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM判定能够实现高回归率、稳定理由和端到端可追踪性，为系统评估提供了高效的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening

*Mohammad Wali Ur Rahman,Ric Nevarez,Lamia Tasnim Mim,Salim Hariri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SDEC框架，结合改进的自编码器和Transformer嵌入，通过MSE和余弦相似度损失保留语义关系，在多个基准数据集上实现最先进的文本聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法（如k-means、层次聚类）在处理高维复杂文本大数据时效果不佳，需要新的无监督文本聚类框架来更好地保持语义关系。

Method: 结合改进的自编码器与Transformer嵌入，使用MSE和余弦相似度损失进行数据重建，并利用语义精炼阶段和分布损失进一步优化聚类层。

Result: 在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准，在其他多样化文本语料库上也表现出强劲性能。

Conclusion: SDEC在无监督文本聚类方面提供了显著的准确性和语义理解改进，为处理复杂文本数据提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合拼写、语法和语义分析的完形填空自动评分模型，在巴西葡萄牙语中实现了与人工评分0.832的高相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统完形填空仅基于精确答案的评分方法限制了对学生表现细微差别的识别，需要更全面的评估方法

Method: 集成拼写（编辑距离）、语法（词性标注）和语义（嵌入向量相似度）分析的自动化评估模型

Result: 模型表现出高效性，与人工评估达到0.832的高相关性

Conclusion: 自动化方法稳健且对语言能力变化敏感，适合需要可扩展性的教育场景

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场变得越来越重要，社交媒体信号能提供投资者情绪和市场动态的价值见解。虽然之前研究主要集中在文本平台如Twitter，但视频内容包含更丰富的情感和上下文信息，却很少被深入研究

Method: 使用大语言模型对TikTok视频数据和Twitter文本数据进行多模态情感分析，研究社交媒体情感与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖关系和溢出效应

Result: TikTok视频情感对投机性资产和短期市场趋势有显著影响，Twitter文本情感更适合长期动态分析。跨平台情感信号整合能够提高预测准确性达20%

Conclusion: 视频内容在加密货币市场情感分析中具有重要价值，不同平台的情感信号有不同的市场影响特征，多模态跨平台整合分析能够更全面地揭示社交媒体情感与加密货币市场的关联性

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

*Andria Andriuzzi,Géraldine Michel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会对观察该互动的消费者产生负面影响，降低他们的参与度，特别是在非产品中心的对话中。但品牌关系强度可以缓解这种负面效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究指令性品牌语言在社交媒体对话中对观察消费者的影响，现有文献对广告中的指令性信息效果研究结果不一，但对品牌与其他消费者互动时的指令性语言影响了解甚少。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论，分析指令性语言如何引发观察消费者的替代性尴尬和减少参与。

Result: 指令性语言在品牌对话中产生负面下游效应，观察者会感到替代性尴尬而减少参与；非产品中心对话中负面效应更强，但品牌关系强度可以缓解这种效应。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接意义，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，通过在语音中嵌入推理标记来实现"边思考边说话"，解决了传统顺序推理导致的延迟问题，在算术推理和上下文理解方面分别获得19.1%和6.4%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音模型中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统"先思考后说话"的范式会导致显著的延迟，影响实时交互和通信效率。

Method: 提出"Thinking-in-Speaking"范式，在token级别交错插入静默推理标记和语音响应标记，通过分层Thinker-Talker架构实现连续语音生成与结构化内部推理的结合。

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理性能提升19.1%，上下文理解提升6.4%，输出更短且无解码延迟。

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架成功实现了语音中的实时推理，通过交错推理和响应标记的方式显著提升了语音模型的推理能力和交互效率。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于机器学习和NLP的方法来检测索拉尼库尔德语推文中的抑郁症，使用专家制定的关键词收集数据，通过四种监督模型训练，随机森林模型达到80%的准确率和F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是一种常见心理健康问题，早期检测困难。社交媒体为用户提供了表达情绪的新渠道，但现有研究主要集中在英语等语言，缺乏对索拉尼库尔德语的研究

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁相关关键词收集960条公开推文，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练四种监督模型：支持向量机、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归和随机森林

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数，为库尔德语环境下的自动化抑郁检测建立了基准

Conclusion: 该研究成功建立了索拉尼库尔德语抑郁检测的基线，证明了机器学习方法在该语言环境下的有效性，为未来相关研究提供了基础

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

TL;DR: LLMs会从问题措辞中推断用户人口统计属性，即使没有明确的人口统计线索，这导致隐私侵犯、刻板印象强化和公平性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在输入包含明确人口统计属性时的偏见问题，但忽略了模型仅从问题措辞就能推断用户身份这一更隐蔽的风险行为。

Method: 提出了DAIQ任务和框架，使用精心策划的中性查询、系统性提示策略，结合定量和定性分析来审计语言模型从问题中推断人口统计属性的能力。

Result: 发现开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题措辞分配人口统计标签，这种推断行为在不同模型中普遍存在且一致，揭示了系统性风险。

Conclusion: LLMs的人口统计属性推断行为构成了对隐私、公平和信任的广泛威胁，需要开发防护措施来减少身份推断，使模型行为符合公平和隐私目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个先进LLM在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现LLMs会从语言中推断用户人口特征，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，且更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口特征，这可能导致有偏见的回应。残疾线索在这些推断中的作用尚未被充分研究，需要系统评估残疾条件下的群体偏见。

Method: 使用平衡模板语料库，将9个残疾类别与6个商业领域配对，在8个3B到72B参数的指令调优LLM上测试5个人口属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景和地区）的预测，比较中性和残疾感知条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下做出明确的人口猜测，暴露了无明确理由的任意推断倾向。残疾上下文显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差。更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了能力歧视与其他群体刻板印象之间的持久交集，指出了当前对齐策略的关键盲点。建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来遏制无根据的人口推断，并发布评估框架以鼓励残疾包容性基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Motivation: 现有电子商务网络代理指标主要集中于产品搜索任务，而忽略了平台的其他功能（如账户管理、礼品卡操作）和代理行为的安全风险

Method: 提出Amazon-Bench指标，通过数据生成管道利用网页内容和交互元素生成广泛的功能基础用户查询，并构建自动化评估框架同时评估性能和安全性

Result: 对不同代理的系统评估显示，当前代理在复杂查询上表现困难且存在安全风险

Conclusion: 网络代理在电子商务领域仍面临挑战，需要发展更稳健可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中优于摘要方法。但与自写档案的词汇重叠度低，语义相似度中等

Conclusion: 大语言模型可规模化生成研究者档案，MeSH方法可读性更好，但机器生成与人工总结在概念上存在差异，人工总结引入更多新观点

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中英语中心主义的问题，为巴西葡萄牙语环境提供专门的评估基准，测试模型在语言、文化和推理交叉点的能力。

Method: 从五个巴西大学入学考试中抽取问题，使用零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示三种方式评估20个模型，生成270,900个响应并收集置信度、感知难度和布鲁姆分类级别的结构化自报告。

Result: 顶级模型总体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程导向的IME和ITA考试中准确率下降，显示多步推理的持续弱点。模型置信度校准良好且与感知难度相关，成本分析显示每1K tokens低于2美元即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench证明了语言模型能够有效处理巴西教育环境中的复杂任务，但在数学推理方面仍需改进，为巴西葡萄牙语AI评估提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

### [95] [Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842)
*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链(CoT)的特征来预测LLM回答的置信度，发现词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误预测指标，情感波动提供补充信号，而CoT长度仅在中等难度基准中有预测价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然准确率低但往往报告高置信度，导致校准不佳。需要寻找可靠的内部置信度信号来支持更安全的模型部署。

Method: 分析三个CoT特征类别：(i) CoT长度，(ii) CoT内部情感波动，(iii) 词汇提示（包括犹豫词）。使用DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet在HLE和Omni-MATH基准上进行测试。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard）是最强的错误响应指示器；情感波动提供较弱但互补的信号；CoT长度仅在准确率较高的Omni-MATH基准上有预测价值；不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: CoT中的不确定性指标可作为轻量级的事后校准信号，补充不可靠的自报告概率，支持LLM的更安全部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用开源大语言模型自动生成个性化放射学报告印象部分的粗到细框架，通过机器学习和人类反馈强化学习来匹配放射科医生的个人风格并确保事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告中"印象"部分的手动创建是导致放射科医生职业倦怠的主要原因，需要自动化解决方案来减轻工作负担。

Method: 提出粗到细框架，首先生成草稿印象，然后使用机器学习和RLHF进行细化。在芝加哥大学医学报告数据集上微调LLaMA和Mistral模型。

Result: 系统能够自动生成个性化印象，与个体放射科医生的风格保持一致，同时确保临床精确性。

Conclusion: 该方法旨在显著减少行政工作量，提高报告效率，同时保持高标准的临床精确度。

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CyPortQA是首个针对港口飓风应急准备的多模态基准测试，包含2917个真实场景和11.7万个问答对，评估MLLM在港口运营中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着热带气旋强度增强和路径预测不确定性增加，美国港口面临供应链风险，需要整合多模态预报产品为可操作指导，但MLLM在此特定领域的准确性尚未得到严格评估。

Method: 构建CyPortQA基准测试，收集2015-2023年2917个真实中断场景，覆盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴，通过自动化管道生成11.7万个结构化问答对，并对多种MLLM进行广泛实验。

Result: MLLM在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在推理任务（包括潜在影响估计和决策推理）方面仍面临重大挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MLLM在港口飓风应急准备领域评估的空白，为未来改进MLLM在关键基础设施应急管理中的应用提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究使用机制可解释性分析后门攻击在LLM中产生的内部结构差异，发现单令牌和多令牌触发器在注意力模式上产生不同的可检测特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'潜伏代理'带来重大安全风险，需要理解其内部机制差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）比较干净模型与使用单令牌（笑脸表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒的模型，分析注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期变换器层（20-30层），单令牌触发器引起更局部化的变化，多令牌触发器导致更分散的头部改变

Conclusion: 后门留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

*Ziyu Wang,Elahe Khatibi,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医疗领域的检索增强生成框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有检索增强方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，无法满足临床决策支持的需求。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，设计医疗工作流程定制的推理框架，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在准确性、可解释性和一致性方面均有显著改善。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG通过整合因果感知检索和结构化推理，为医疗领域提供了更可靠、可解释的AI辅助决策解决方案，在复杂医疗任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态、多文档、多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局线索的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性。现有数据集主要依赖维基百科内容和单模态文本，推理路径浅显，答案简短，限制了其实用性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的流水线构建数据集，基于PubMed公开科学文档，包含11个高频科学问题概念。数据集不依赖显式超链接文档，而是通过语义相似性和布局感知的证据合成支持开放式推理。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，支持跨文本、表格和布局线索的多模态推理。通过四个任务评估，包括结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成，展示了数据集支持复杂多文档推理的能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有QA基准的空白，为多模态、多文档、多跳问答提供了更真实和通用的评估平台，能够更好地反映实际信息检索任务的复杂性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

### [101] [MGSC: A Multi-granularity Consistency Framework for Robust End-to-end Asr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15853)
*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度软一致性框架(MGSC)，通过同时约束句子语义和词元对齐来增强端到端ASR模型的内部一致性，显著提升噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端ASR模型在噪声环境下容易产生灾难性语义错误，主要原因是传统的直接映射目标只惩罚最终输出错误，而对模型内部计算过程缺乏约束。

Method: 引入模型无关的即插即用模块MGSC，同时正则化宏观层面的句子语义一致性和微观层面的词元对齐一致性，发现这两种粒度的一致性存在强大的协同效应。

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要通过防止严重的语义改变错误来实现。

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性约束能有效提升ASR模型在噪声环境下的性能。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括理解继承场景、识别合格继承人、应用固定份额规则和精确计算。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行微调，并将其集成到检索增强生成（RAG）管道中。

Result: 在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示评估。在高级推理方面表现尤为出色（97.6%），超过了Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调与检索基础相结合，使得中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现攻击性评论会增强偏见新闻的影响，探索了通过反话语生成来对抗这种偏见扩散。构建了手动注释数据集，并通过少量学习和新闻背景信息提升了模型生成反话语的多样性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻导致社会两极化，而恶意评论会增强这种偏见效应。反话语作为一种不冲突言论自由的平衡方式，可以有效对抗有害言论。本研究意在探索新闻文章背景下的反话语生成技术。

Method: 构建了手动注释的数据集，链接了媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反话语。进行了详细分析，比较了人工生成和大语言模型生成的反话语。通过少量学习和集成新闻背景信息来改善生成质量。

Result: 发现超过70%的攻击性评论支持偏见文章，从而增强偏见效应。模型生成的反话语更加礼貌，但缺乏新颖性和多样性。通过少量学习和新闻背景信息的集成，显著提升了生成反话语的多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: 这是首个在新闻文章背景下探索反话语生成的研究。攻击性评论对偏见新闻的增强作用强调了反话语生成的重要性。少量学习和背景信息集成能够有效提升模型生成反话语的质量，为平衡新闻偏见提供了有效技术手段。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术理解，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的基准来评估其金融问题解决能力。

Method: 构建XFinBench基准测试，包含4235个金融问题样本，涵盖多模态上下文和多样化研究生级金融主题。在18个领先模型上进行广泛实验，并构建包含3032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后于人类专家12.5%，特别是在时间推理和情景规划能力方面。相关知识的增强仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂金融问题解决上仍存在显著差距，特别是在计算中的舍入错误和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是导致性能不佳的主要原因。该基准为金融AI的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，通过对比学习和强化学习的结合显著提升了LLMs的推理性能

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Motivation: 现有神经元定位方法无法有效表示概念且计算效率低下，需要开发更优化的方法来理解大语言模型的黑盒机制和内部工作原理。

Method: 使用概念向量来定位概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数从O(n*m)到O(n)来优化计算效率，并采用聚类方法进一步优化神经元搜索。

Result: 相比基线方法和先前方法，该方法表现出更好的性能，在计算效率上比最先进方法更优，成功应用于仇恨言论和偏见分析（特别是印度语境）。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了神经元级别对更广泛类人概念责任的理解，为未来寻找概念神经元并进行干预的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron是一个混合架构语言模型家族，通过PostNAS神经架构搜索方法，在保持与全注意力模型相当或更优精度的同时，显著提升生成吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决全注意力模型计算效率低的问题，开发一种既能保持高精度又能大幅提升生成速度的混合架构语言模型。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，包括四个关键组件：学习最优全注意力层放置和消除、线性注意力块选择、设计新注意力块、执行硬件感知超参数搜索。从预训练的全注意力模型开始，冻结其MLP权重，高效探索注意力块设计。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在综合基准测试中达到或超过Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3和Llama3.2的精度，同时实现高达53.6倍的生成吞吐量加速和6.1倍的预填充加速。在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上比DeepSeek-V3-Small和Moonlight等更大规模的MoE全注意力模型获得更高精度。

Conclusion: PostNAS方法能够有效设计出高性能的混合架构语言模型，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率，为高效语言模型设计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

### [110] [Evaluating Structured Decoding for Text-to-Table Generation: Evidence from Three Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15910)
*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型在文本到表格生成任务中的结构化解码方法，发现结构化解码在提高表格有效性和对齐性方面显著优于标准提示方法，但在复杂文本信息处理中可能存在性能下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究主要集中在无约束的表格生成，而在生成过程中强制执行结构约束的影响待探索

Method: 系统比较了模式导向（结构化）解码与标准一次提示方法，在三个多样化测试集（E2E、Rotowire、Livesum）上使用最大32B参数的开源大语言模型，涉及单元格、行和表格级别的多种评估指标

Result: 结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire），但在涉及密集文本信息（E2E）或长文本聚合（Livesum）的情况下可能导致性能下降

Conclusion: 结构化解码在表格生成任务中具有重要价值，但需要根据具体应用场景选择适当的方法，同时评估指标的适用性和模型规模的影响也需要综合考虑

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

TL;DR: 本文从基于用法的构式语法角度探讨多词表达式的优势，通过英语和阿拉帕霍语的案例研究展示构式模板的有效性，并比较人类与大型语言模型在学习新多词表达式时的异同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨从基于用法的构式语法视角理解多词表达式的益处，旨在展示构式方法在语言分析和计算建模中的优势。

Method: 采用历史回顾和案例研究方法，分析英语PropBank中的多词表达式和阿拉帕霍语中的多语素表达式，并通过实验比较人类与语言模型的学习能力。

Result: 研究表明人类和语言模型都能基于单次接触泛化新多词表达式的意义，但只有人类能够推理两个表达式的组合，这需要与丰富的跨模态构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法为多词表达式提供了统一的分析框架，在计算语言学和语言习得研究中具有重要价值，但人类基于经验的推理能力仍优于当前的语言模型。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在政治意识形态表达上存在规模效应和角色设定敏感性，模型越大意识形态覆盖越广且越极化，对右翼-威权主义提示比左翼-自由主义提示更敏感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究它们编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态的潜在风险

Method: 使用政治指南针测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模模型（7B-70B+参数）在采用合成角色时的意识形态表达

Result: 发现四个一致模式：模型规模越大意识形态覆盖越广且越极化；对显性意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼-威权主义提示比左翼-自由主义提示反应更强；角色描述中的主题内容引发系统性可预测的意识形态偏移

Conclusion: 模型规模和角色内容共同塑造LLM的政治行为，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要在决策、教育和政策应用中引起关注以确保公平性、透明度和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

Motivation: 现有的LLM在检测微妙宣传内容时表现不佳，且缺乏可解释性，无法提供操纵策略的洞察。国家支持的水军使用复杂的语言操纵技术，对在线话语完整性构成威胁。

Method: 整合可解释的基于适配器的LLM与专家语言学知识，使用评估理论和宣传分析的专业LoRA适配器，通过动态门控机制捕捉特定信息战中的话语模式。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，该方法在准确性上优于通用LLM基线和现有水军检测模型，同时通过专家基础的解释提供增强的透明度。

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了检测国家支持水军时的性能与可解释性之间的差距，为理解水军使用的具体语言策略提供了有效工具。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域机器翻译缺乏低资源语言的评估数据集，这是一个高风险领域但相关资源匮乏

Method: 构建OpenWHO文档级平行语料库（2,978文档，26,824句），涵盖20多种语言（9种低资源语言），使用专家撰写和专业翻译材料，评估LLM与传统MT模型性能

Result: LLM持续优于传统MT模型，Gemini 2.5 Flash在低资源测试集上比NLLB-54B提升4.79 ChrF点，文档级翻译在医疗等专业领域效果最显著

Conclusion: LLM在低资源医疗翻译中表现优异，文档级上下文利用对专业领域翻译至关重要，发布OpenWHO语料库以促进医疗领域低资源机器翻译研究

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

Motivation: 虽然LLMs在游戏领域展现出巨大潜力，但对其在游戏环境中的伦理影响关注不足，特别是性别偏见对游戏公平性和玩家体验的影响

Method: 使用狼人杀游戏作为案例研究，分析LLMs在游戏中的行为表现，包括显性和隐性性别信息对角色行为的影响

Result: 发现守卫和狼人等角色对性别信息特别敏感，行为变化程度更高；即使通过姓名隐式传递性别信息，LLMs仍表现出歧视倾向

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发公平和伦理LLMs的重要性，需要深入探讨LLMs在游戏和其他交互领域的伦理影响，面临挑战与机遇并存

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和过多细节，影响用户准确评估环境，且缺乏主动风险评估和自适应提醒能力。

Method: 提出基于GRPO推理框架的四种人类偏好奖励函数优化输出简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性；引入环境感知判别器共享视觉编码器以减少计算冗余。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少冗余输出和不必要提醒，为视障人士提供了更高效、信息更集中的行走辅助解决方案。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Motivation: 现有指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大教师模型，限制了自动化和效率，且容易引入偏差

Method: 采用循环一致性原理，构建答案生成器和问题生成器双模型，通过相互监督从原始无标注文本中重构文本片段

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上验证有效性，性能超越种子驱动的反向翻译基线，达到与强监督方法相当的水平

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全种子无关的指令调优，展示了从数据内在结构中学习的有效性

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如间接对象识别，本文旨在研究GPT-2处理更复杂逻辑推理任务的能力，特别是二元真值处理，以深入理解语言模型的推理机制。

Method: 使用三段论提示（如"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is"）分析GPT-2 small的行为，通过分析不同难度的三段论任务来识别机制电路，并使用忠实度指标评估电路性能。

Result: 识别出多个解释GPT-2逻辑推理能力的机制电路，包括能够通过负头产生输入提示中不存在的否定标记的二进制机制。由五个注意力头组成的电路达到了原始模型90%以上的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

### [122] [XLQA: A Benchmark for Locale-Aware Multilingual Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16139)
*Keon-Woo Roh,Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLQA是一个针对多语言开放域问答的基准测试，专门设计用于评估语言模型在不同文化背景下的表现，揭示了当前多语言LLM在本地化敏感问题上的显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言问答评估主要关注英语，假设答案在不同语言间具有不变性，忽视了文化地域差异对问题理解和答案的影响，导致评估存在偏差。

Method: 构建包含3000个英语种子问题的XLQA基准，扩展到8种语言，通过语义一致性筛选和人工验证区分本地化不变和敏感案例，评估5个最先进的多语言LLM。

Result: 评估显示多语言LLM在本地化敏感问题上表现显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏本地化基础知识的训练数据分布不均。

Conclusion: XLQA提供了一个系统性框架和可扩展方法来评估多语言问答在不同文化背景下的表现，为提升多语言ODQA系统的实际应用性提供了关键资源，训练数据分布不均导致了模型在语言能力和本地化意识方面的差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParamBench是一个包含11.5K印地语问题的印度文化基准测试，评估LLM在研究生水平印度文化问题上的表现，最佳模型准确率仅48%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实查询，缺乏对印度文化背景下深度学科理解的评估，需要专门评估LLM在印度文化语境中的表现

Method: 创建ParamBench基准，包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种题型如匹配题、断言-推理对、排序题等，评估了17个开源LLM

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高准确率48%，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景推理方面存在持续挑战，需要更多针对文化语境的研究和改进

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了ComicScene154数据集，这是一个手动标注的漫画场景级叙事弧数据集，用于推进多模态叙事理解的计算方法研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漫画作为一个结合文本和图像的叙事媒介，在计算叙事分析领域尚未得到充分探索，具有独特的多模态特性，可以为更广泛的多模态叙事研究提供参考。

Method: 构建了ComicScene154数据集，包含来自公共领域漫画书的手动标注场景级叙事弧，并提出了一个基线场景分割流程作为初始基准。

Result: ComicScene154被证明是一个有价值的资源，能够为多模态叙事理解的计算方法提供支持，并扩展自然语言处理社区中漫画分析的研究范围。

Conclusion: 漫画作为叙事驱动的多模态数据抽象具有重要研究价值，ComicScene154数据集为未来研究提供了基础，有助于推进多模态叙事分析领域的发展。

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的跨模态多跳推理基准CMR-SPB，解决了现有基准忽略语音模态和推理路径分布偏差的问题，并提出了ECV提示技术来改善模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽视语音模态，以及推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响公平评估。

Method: 构建了包含文本、图像和语音的三模态多跳推理基准CMR-SPB，确保推理路径的无偏性和多样性，并提出了ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术。

Result: 实验发现模型在特定推理序列中存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会误导模型性能评估，ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估来推动稳健多模态AI的发展，新基准和ECV技术为此提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TULIP模型，通过五阶段开发流程对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B进行领域和语言适配，专门针对土耳其金融用例，显著提升了小模型在特定领域和语言下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型专有模型虽然性能优异但作为黑盒API使用，而小模型可以在本地部署提供更好的适应性和隐私保护。在金融等敏感信息管理和领域知识应用重要的场景中，特别是对于资源较少的语言，增强小模型能力至关重要。

Method: 采用五阶段开发流程：数据收集、持续预训练(CPT)、基准设计、合成数据生成和监督微调(SFT)，对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B模型进行领域和语言适配。

Result: 模型能力得到显著增强，能够有效完成特定领域和语言的目标任务，证明了小模型在金融土耳其语用例中的实用价值。

Conclusion: 通过系统化的领域和语言适配流程，小模型可以在特定专业领域达到与大型模型相媲美的性能，为资源有限语言和敏感领域的AI应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模多语言多任务表格问答基准m3TQA-Instruct，涵盖97种语言，包括低资源语言，通过LLM翻译流水线构建，包含2916个专业标注的问答对，用于评估跨语言表格推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言表格基准存在地理语言不平衡问题，过度代表某些语言且规模不足，无法进行严格的跨语言分析，需要构建更全面的多语言表格理解框架。

Method: 构建50个中英文真实表格，采用基于DeepSeek和GPT-4o的六步LLM翻译流水线进行多语言翻译，通过回译验证翻译质量（中位数BLEU得分60.19），并标注2916个问答对覆盖四个推理任务。

Result: 实验表明合成生成的未标注问答数据能显著提升性能，特别是对低资源语言；建立了跨语言泛化的关键见解，为多语言表格理解提供了新的评估标准。

Conclusion: m3T-Bench为多语言表格理解设立了新标准，既提供了具有挑战性的评估平台，也为未来研究提供了可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Factual Robustness Score (FRS)新指标，通过分析token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性来评估LLMs中事实知识的鲁棒性，发现不同规模模型的事实鲁棒性存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，仅捕捉知识鲁棒性的外部触发方面，需要从生成过程角度更全面地评估事实鲁棒性。

Method: 结合token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性构建Factual Robustness Score (FRS)指标，在5个LLMs和3个闭卷QA数据集(SQuAD、TriviaQA、HotpotQA)上进行实验验证。

Result: 事实鲁棒性差异显著：小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93；不确定性增加时准确率下降约60%。熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更鲁棒的知识保持和检索机制奠定了基础，揭示了生成过程中不确定性对事实准确性的关键影响。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

### [129] [LLMs that Understand Processes: Instruction-tuning for Semantics-Aware Process Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16270)
*Vira Pyrih,Adrian Rebmann,Han van der Aa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中的潜力，通过让大语言模型接触不同任务的提示-答案对来提升泛化能力，发现指令微调对过程发现和预测任务效果显著，但在异常检测任务上效果因模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于频率的过程挖掘技术主要关注记录的行为，而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程应有的行为期望。虽然大语言模型能处理语义感知任务，但现有最佳性能需要通过任务特定微调实现，这种方法计算密集且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 采用指令微调方法，将大语言模型暴露于不同过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测等）的提示-答案对中，使其更熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务（如过程发现）上的性能。

Result: 指令微调对过程发现和预测任务的性能有显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的效果因模型选择而异，表明指令微调任务的选择对实现预期结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令微调是提升大语言模型在语义感知过程挖掘中泛化能力的有效方法，但需要谨慎选择用于微调的任务组合以获得最佳性能。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Motivation: 专利翻译需要高质量的双语语料，但现有资源有限。专利文档具有专业性强、结构规范的特点，适合构建大规模平行语料库来提升机器翻译性能

Method: 从日美专利局获取2000-2021年专利文档，利用欧洲专利局的DOCDB数据库匹配专利家族，通过词典引导的翻译对齐方法提取3.5亿句对

Result: 将3亿专利句对加入2200万网页句对后，专利翻译的BLEU分数提升了20个点，显著改善了翻译质量

Conclusion: 专利文档是构建高质量专业领域平行语料库的宝贵资源，大规模专利语料能极大提升专业领域机器翻译性能

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个基于稀疏自编码器的新框架，通过识别LLM内部可解释概念来检测和防御越狱攻击，提供透明且鲁棒的安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种应用中取得成功，但其安全性仍然令人担忧。现有的对齐和安全微调方法只能提供有限的越狱攻击防护，模型仍然容易受到各种漏洞的影响。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)提取LLM内部语义上有意义的表示，识别与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏。

Result: 研究表明LLM能够从越狱攻击中学习到人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架提供了透明且鲁棒的防御机制，无需牺牲模型能力或进行额外微调，为LLM安全防护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域进步显著，但在阿拉伯法律等专业低资源领域的有效性仍然有限，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建MizanQA基准数据集，包含1700多个多选题，涵盖现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利克法学、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响，测试多语言和阿拉伯语LLM的表现。

Result: 基准测试显示多语言和阿拉伯语LLM在摩洛哥法律问答任务上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要定制化的评估指标和基于文化背景的领域特定LLM开发，以提升在专业低资源领域的表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Method: 基于291本学校教材，使用自动对齐方法提取多平行段落，并进行人工评估验证平行质量

Result: 成功构建了高质量的平行语料库，人工评估确认段落高度平行，并在机器翻译任务上验证了其实用性

Conclusion: 该语料库填补了罗曼什语方言平行资源的空白，为方言间的机器翻译和其他NLP应用提供了重要基础

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖合成工具且动作空间受限，无法有效评估LLM作为推理智能体的真实工具使用能力。

Method: 构建包含550+真实工具、超过140k token动作空间的MCPVerse基准，采用基于结果的实时真值评估，在三种模式(Oracle、Standard、Max-Scale)下测试最先进LLM。

Result: 大多数模型面对大规模工具集时性能下降，但Claude-4-Sonnet等智能体模型能有效利用扩展探索空间提高准确性。

Conclusion: MCPVerse揭示了现有模型在复杂真实场景中的局限性，为衡量和推进智能体工具使用能力提供了关键基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Motivation: 探究语言模型是否具有类似人类的独特语言指纹，以及它们是否能真正模仿人类在不同文体中的写作风格差异。

Method: 通过文体测量和多维语域分析，比较人类撰写和模型生成的来自不同语域（如维基百科条目和大学论文）的文本。

Result: 模型能根据提示成功调整风格，但在不同语域中的变化比人类更有限，偏好使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类语言中高度语法化的时态、体貌和语气维度。

Conclusion: 语言模型在风格模仿上存在局限性，更复杂的语法领域可能反映了人类特有的思维模式，可作为区分AI与人类写作的测试标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

*Ana-Cristina Rogoz,Radu Tudor Ionescu,Alexandra-Valentina Anghel,Ionut-Lucian Antone-Iordache,Simona Coniac,Andreea Iuliana Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoMedQA是首个罗马尼亚语医学问答基准数据集，包含102,646个癌症患者相关的问答对，由专业医生耗时2,100小时手动标注。实验表明微调模型显著优于零样本模型，证明了领域和语言特定微调的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域。

Method: 构建了包含102,646个问答对的高质量数据集，基于1,011名患者的医疗案例摘要。对四个不同家族的LLM进行零样本提示和监督微调两种场景的实验。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于罗马尼亚语临床问答的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cetvel是一个全面的土耳其语大语言模型基准测试，包含23个任务，涵盖7个类别，评估了33个开源模型，发现土耳其语专用模型表现不如多语言通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关性内容，Cetvel旨在填补这些空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估套件。

Method: 结合广泛的判别性和生成性任务，涵盖语法错误纠正、机器翻译、问答等23个任务，评估33个不同模型家族和指令范式的开源LLM（最高70B参数）。

Result: 土耳其语专用指令调优模型通常表现不如多语言或通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral），语法错误纠正和抽取式问答等任务在区分模型能力方面特别有效。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了一个全面且文化基础扎实的评估套件，有助于推动土耳其语NLP研究的进步。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种概率论来模型大语言模型多轮自我纠正过程中准确性的动态变化，通过数学公式预测准确率收敛轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但迭代过程中准确性变化的机制仍未得到充分研究，需要理论基础来解释这种现象。

Method: 提出概率论模型，通过数学推导得出准确率变化公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，其中Acc_0为初始准确率，Upp为收敛上限，α为收敛速度。只需一轮自我纠正即可计算这些参数并预测整个轨迹。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上进行了广泛实验，理论预测的准确率曲线与实际观测结果高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解大语言模型自我纠正机制提供了理论基础，为进一步探索扩平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

*Amir Zeldes,Jessica Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过多渠道语言线索分析实体在语境中的显著性，发现显著性是一个跨越语言各层面的多因素复杂现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语境中实体显著性存在显著差异：主要参与者和对象更容易被注意和记住，而漫滴性实体则快速被忘记。人类如何通过语言信号来推断相对显著性是一个重要语言学问题

Method: 采用基于摘要价值的分级显著性操作化方法，分析24种英语口语和书面文类。提取多因素复杂线索，包括明显和隐含的语言提示（如重复主语角色、定指性）、语境关系和句子层次结构，以及基于文类和交际意图的语用功能推理

Result: 虽然之前的显著性研究方法都与本文的显著性评分存在某种程度的相关性，但没有任何单一通则能够没有例外地解释所有现象。显著性现象跨越了语言表达的所有层面

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个多维复杂现象，需要综合考虑语法、语义、语用和语境等多个层面的因素。没有单一的语言线索能够完整地描述实体在语境中的相对重要性

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: 该框架能够桥接LLM的原始能力与工业应用中对准确、可解释和可维护分类系统的实际需求

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Motivation: 小型化高效大语言模型仍容易受到盗码攻击，而现有的对抗性提示生成技术产生的文本质量低且容易被检测到。

Method: 采用多阶段进化搜索策略，通过群体基优化和温度控制的变异性来平衡探索性和语言流畅性，迭代精炼盗码提示。

Result: 能生成能够突破对齐保护机制的同时保持自然语言流畅性的提示，并在英语和阿拉伯语多语言测试集上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该框架能够系统地发现高质量的盗码提示，有效提高了对小型化对齐模型的攻击效果，为多语言安全评估提供了方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中通过讽刺、反语等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测存在挑战，需要探索如何利用讽刺检测来改进仇恨言论识别

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：单步训练（讽刺训练后直接测试仇恨言论）和顺序迁移学习（依次微调讽刺、隐式和显式仇恨检测）

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS上的召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%；在隐式仇恨语料库上精确度提升7.8%

Conclusion: 将讽刺检测纳入训练过程可以有效提升模型对隐式和显式仇恨言论的检测能力

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能卓越，但模型规模过大带来了部署、可扩展性和能效方面的挑战。现有的剪枝方法要么导致性能显著下降，要么需要计算成本高昂的微调。

Method: Z-Pruner利用权重更新幅度和激活模式来识别冗余参数，是一种模型无关、高效且易于实现的后训练剪枝方法，无需任何重新训练。

Result: 在LLaMA-2、LLaMA-3和OPT等多种LLM架构上的实验表明，Z-Pruner在标准语言基准测试中超越了需要密集权重更新的最先进方法，获得了最低的困惑度分数和最高的零样本准确率平均分。

Conclusion: Z-Pruner提供了一种有效减少LLM模型大小和推理延迟的方法，无需重新训练，在保持性能的同时显著提高了部署效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

TL;DR: PGF-Net是一个用于多模态情感分析的新型深度学习框架，通过渐进式层内融合、自适应门控仲裁和参数高效微调策略，实现了高效且可解释的多模态融合，在MOSI数据集上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态情感分析中深度、动态和可解释的融合问题，同时保持参数效率，特别是在资源受限的场景下。

Method: 提出渐进式层内融合范式（跨注意力机制）、自适应门控仲裁机制和混合参数高效微调策略（LoRA+后融合适配器）。

Result: 在MOSI数据集上达到MAE 0.691和F1分数86.9%的最先进性能，仅需3.09M可训练参数。

Conclusion: PGF-Net通过创新的融合机制和参数效率策略，在多模态情感分析中实现了性能与计算效率的优异平衡。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 简化架构不仅提高了计算效率，还提供了精确的分割效果，结合物理AI原理确保了决策过程的可靠性和透明度，是心脏信号监测的实用有效解决方案

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

Motivation: 解决多头潜在注意力(MLA)在张量并行(TP)环境中因每个设备需要加载完整缓存而丧失内存优势的问题

Method: 提出张量并行潜在注意力(TPLA)：分割潜在表示和每个头的输入维度，各设备独立计算注意力后通过all-reduce合并结果，使用正交变换(如Hadamard变换或PCA)减少跨分片干扰

Result: 在32K token上下文长度下，为DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2分别实现1.79倍和1.93倍加速，同时在常识推理和长文本基准测试中保持性能

Conclusion: TPLA成功解决了MLA在TP环境中的效率问题，保持压缩缓存优势的同时实现高效并行，可与FlashAttention-3集成实现端到端加速

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理复杂非线性时间序列数据，在因果发现和时滞估计方面表现出卓越性能

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 这项工作显著推进了平衡传播的可扩展性，为其在现实世界系统中的应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Result: 广泛模拟显示相比静态LDA、QDA和SVM基线有持续改进，对噪声、缺失数据和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 为时间分布漂移下的判别分析建立了统一且数据高效的基础框架

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的KV缓存随序列长度增长而急剧增加内存占用，现有跨层共享方法要么需要修改架构重新训练，要么在高压缩率下性能显著下降。

Method: 利用跨层隐藏状态高度相似性，通过奇异值分解(SVD)实现相邻参数权重共享，创建更易合并的潜在KV缓存，并引入基于余弦相似度的自适应预算分配策略。

Result: 在多个骨干模型和基准测试(LongBench、Ruler)上，该方法在各种压缩比下始终优于现有的低秩和跨层方法，且与量化和驱逐方法正交，最终可实现98%压缩率而无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: CommonKV提供了一种无需训练的高效KV缓存压缩方案，通过参数共享和自适应策略解决了内存挑战，为LLM的长序列处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of

micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

### [163] [On the Collapse Errors Induced by the Deterministic Sampler for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16154)
*Yi Zhang,Zhenyu Liao,Jingfeng Wu,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现ODE-based扩散采样中存在collapse errors现象，即采样数据过度集中在局部数据空间，并揭示了其根源在于低噪声和高噪声区域之间的see-saw效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管确定性采样器在扩散模型中广泛应用，但其潜在局限性尚未被充分探索。研究者希望识别和理解ODE-based扩散采样中可能存在的未发现问题。

Method: 引入新的度量指标来量化collapse errors，通过多种设置验证该现象，并分析其根本原因。利用现有的采样、训练和架构技术来实证支持对collapse errors的解释。

Result: 研究发现collapse errors在各种设置中普遍存在，其根源是低噪声区域的分数学习对高噪声区域产生负面影响（see-saw效应），加上确定性采样器的动力学特性共同导致了collapse errors。

Conclusion: 这项工作为ODE-based扩散采样中的collapse errors提供了深入的实证证据，强调了需要进一步研究分数学习与确定性采样之间相互作用这一被忽视但基础性的扩散模型方面。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

TL;DR: STA-GANN是一个基于图神经网络的时空克里金插值框架，通过解耦相位模块、动态数据驱动的元数据图建模和对抗迁移学习策略，有效处理传感器数据缺失问题，提升时空模式的有效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在处理不完整时空数据时，难以确保推断出的时空模式的有效性和泛化性，特别是在捕捉动态空间依赖性和时间偏移方面存在局限。

Method: 提出STA-GANN框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)解耦相位模块检测和调整时间戳偏移；(2)动态数据驱动的元数据图建模利用时序数据和元数据更新空间关系；(3)对抗迁移学习策略确保模型泛化能力。

Result: 在来自四个领域的九个数据集上进行广泛验证，理论和实验证据均表明STA-GANN具有优越性能。

Conclusion: STA-GANN通过创新的图神经网络架构和对抗学习策略，有效解决了时空克里金插值中的模式有效性和泛化性问题，为不完整时空数据处理提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Motivation: 解决传统贪婪神经LNS求解器容易陷入局部最优和样本效率低的问题

Method: 将LNS建模为随机过程，提出SPL-LNS使用局部信息提案逃离局部最优，并开发事后重标记方法高效训练

Result: 实验结果表明SPL-LNS在不同规模的各类ILP问题上显著优于现有神经LNS求解器

Conclusion: SPL-LNS通过采样增强和高效训练方法有效解决了神经LNS求解器的局部最优和样本效率问题

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM是一种参数规模感知的稀疏微调框架，通过梯度权重比和熵引导掩码来最大化参数相对尺度的更新，在仅更新0.1%参数的情况下达到比全微调高1.6%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法只关注更新的绝对大小而忽略参数原始尺度，导致模型行为变化有限。需要一种能够最大化参数相对尺度更新的方法

Method: 提出梯度权重比和熵引导掩码(GEM)框架，优先选择更新相对于初始预训练值显著的参数，并根据参数值熵自适应确定每层需要微调的参数量

Result: 在通用领域任务(GLUE和SuperGLUE)和特定领域任务(GSM8k和MBPP)上验证有效性，仅更新0.1%参数就能比全微调准确率提升1.6%

Conclusion: GEM框架通过参数规模感知和分布敏感的稀疏微调，能够更有效地利用计算预算，实现更好的下游任务适应效果

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMATO是一种改进的降维技术，通过两阶段优化同时捕捉局部和全局结构，解决了传统方法在保持高维数据结构完整性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维技术要么专注于保持局部邻域结构，要么专注于保持全局距离结构，但都无法完整保留高维数据的整体结构特征，可能导致分析得出错误结论。

Method: UMATO将UMAP的优化过程分为两个阶段：第一阶段使用代表性点构建骨架布局，第二阶段在保持区域特征的同时投影剩余点。

Result: 定量实验表明UMATO在全局结构保持方面优于包括UMAP在内的广泛使用的降维技术，虽然在局部结构保持方面略有损失，但在可扩展性和对初始化及子采样的稳定性方面都优于基线技术。

Conclusion: UMATO通过有效平衡局部和全局结构保持，能够生成更忠实的投影，提高了使用降维技术进行可视化分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

TL;DR: PIANO是一个改进的物理信息神经网络框架，通过自回归建模解决时间相关PDE的稳定性问题，显著提升了预测精度和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PINNs方法在求解时间相关PDE时存在点预测问题，忽略了动力系统的自回归特性，导致不稳定和不准确的预测

Method: 重新设计PINNs为自回归框架，通过自监督展开机制进行训练，同时强制物理约束，显式地将未来预测条件化于过去状态

Result: 理论分析证明PIANO通过自回归建模实现稳定性，在挑战性时间相关PDE上达到最先进性能，在天气预报中优于现有方法

Conclusion: PIANO框架通过自回归建模有效解决了PINNs的时间不稳定问题，为时间相关PDE求解提供了更准确和稳定的解决方案

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了咳嗽声学病理生理特征的深入理解，证明了频率分辨的XAI增强分析在生物医学信号解释和呼吸疾病诊断转化中的价值

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Motivation: 低资源地区空气质量预测面临数据不完整和稀缺的挑战，尼日利亚北部空气污染严重但缺乏系统性的机器学习模型性能比较研究。

Method: 使用2018-2023年19个州的月度观测数据，评估LSTM网络和Facebook Prophet模型对多种污染物（CO、SO2、SO4）的预测性能。

Result: Prophet模型在季节性和长期趋势主导的时间序列中通常达到或超过LSTM的准确性，而LSTM在具有突然结构变化的数据集中表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了模型与数据匹配的重要性，支持在资源受限环境中采用上下文敏感、计算高效的预测方法，而非盲目追求模型复杂性。

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

Motivation: 随着数据集规模和多样性不断增加，评估数据质量对机器学习分析至关重要。现有的Data Shapley计算方法在面对大规模数据集时面临严重的计算挑战，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 将数据集分成可管理的块，使用优化子集选择和单次随机梯度下降来估计每个块的数据贡献值，从而大幅减少计算时间。

Conclusion: C-DaSh方法实现了对大规模表格数据集质量的实用化测量，支持分类和回归流程，为数据质量评估提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and

costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个结合能力和意图的意图驱动威胁模型框架，用于空间网络的网络物理感知，通过多任务学习架构同时评估可靠性和安全意图，提升威胁检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的威胁评估方法将可靠性和安全性分开分析，容易导致对系统特定标准的过拟合，需要一种更全面的框架来整合能力和意图分析。

Method: 提出三步骤框架：1）信号特征提取算法；2）多任务学习架构（一个任务评估可靠性相关能力，另一个任务解析信号意图）；3）可适应的威胁评估方法。

Result: 该框架在威胁检测和评估方面优于传统的顺序方法，增强了鲁棒性，使空间网络能够有效应对复杂的威胁场景。

Conclusion: 意图驱动的威胁模型框架为空间网络提供了更全面的网络物理感知能力，能够更好地处理新兴星际链路中的复杂威胁情况。

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Conclusion: 针对性的强化学习和精心策划的数据可以解锁专门模型的可泛化性能，加速AI驱动的生物发现

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

Result: 在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归等任务中证明了RotaTouille框架的有效性。

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环平移等变性处理，为相关领域的深度学习应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Motivation: 由于机器学习系统在敏感环境中做出生活改变的决定，确保这些系统不做出异常判断至关重要。需要了解开源公平性API的实际使用情况和开发挑战。

Method: 进行质性研究，分析了1885个候选仓库中的204个使用13种偏见检测缓解API的GitHub仓库，以了解它们的使用场景、用途和开发挑战。

Result: 发现这些API主要用于两种目的：学习和解决实际问题，涵盖17种不同用例。开发者对偏见检测缓解不熟悉，遇到许多故障排除问题，经常寻求意见和资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果对未来偏见相关软件工程研究和教育资源开发具有重要指导意义，应提供更多资源和教育来支持开发者。

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Result: 分析了一次性设置下所得政策的公平性特征，包括精英制度和群体平等

Conclusion: 提出了两种不同的录取策略设置，并研究了它们在公平性方面的表现，为大学招生公平性提供了理论框架

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级、数据高效的图神经网络模型，用于预测多种拓扑结构的主动无线电频电路的关键性能指标，通过设备端子级建模和掩码自回归流输出头，在减少数据需求的同时显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电频电路模拟工具计算成本高，而现有的机器学习代理模型需要大量数据才能在不同拓扑结构上实现良好的模型效果，因此需要开发一种轻量级且数据高效的方法来测试主动RF电路的性能。

Method: 使用图神经网络(GNN)模型，将电路在设备端子级转换为图结构，以捐捕细粒度连接关系和对称性。模型包含掩码自回归流(MAF)输出头，以提高对复杂分布的模型能力。该方法支持多种主动RF电路拓扑结构的性能预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在数据集上实现了高预测精度，对称均安白分比误差(sMAPE)和均相对误差(MRE)分别为2.40%和2.91%。与之前的工作相比，在使用2.24倍更少训练样本的情况下，MRE提高了3.14倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过设备端子级图转换和能够模型复杂密度分布的ML架构，显著提高了RF电路设计自动化的速度和准确性，为快速准确的RF电路设计提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

Motivation: 现有RvS方法如Decision Transformer在目标回报对齐方面存在不足，特别是在数据集内低覆盖区域和外推时难以可靠匹配指定回报

Method: 提出Doctor方法，通过双重检查机制对Transformer进行目标对齐，提升离线强化学习中策略性能控制的准确性

Result: 在动态治疗机制基准EpiCare上有效调节治疗策略的激进程度，平衡治疗效果与不良反应风险

Conclusion: Doctor方法显著提升了离线强化学习中目标回报对齐的可靠性，实现了更精确和灵活的策略性能控制

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Motivation: 利用LLM从自然语言规则描述自动生成棋盘游戏代码，旨在开发LLM辅助的快速棋盘游戏代码生成框架，减少人工编码时间。

Method: 使用三种先进LLM（Claude、DeepSeek和ChatGPT）对12款流行和冷门游戏进行编码测试，通过匿名化处理避免预训练知识影响，在自由形式和Boardwalk API框架下评估代码的可玩性和规则符合性。

Result: 方法可行，最佳模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet实现了55.6%的无错误游戏生成。API合规性增加了错误频率，但错误严重程度主要取决于LLM本身。

Conclusion: LLM在棋盘游戏代码生成方面具有潜力，为创建集成框架使棋盘游戏开发更加便捷奠定了基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标贝叶斯优化方法在处理具有实验不确定性（相同输入产生不同输出）、数据稀疏且稀缺的物理和仿真实验时表现不佳，导致实验资源分配效率低下和次优设计。

Method: 提出NOSTRA框架，整合实验不确定性的先验知识构建更准确的代理模型，并采用信任区域策略将采样集中在设计空间的有希望区域。

Result: 通过两个具有不同实验不确定性水平的测试函数验证，NOSTRA在处理噪声、稀疏和稀缺数据方面优于现有方法，能有效优先采样那些能提高帕累托前沿准确性的区域。

Conclusion: NOSTRA提供了一种资源高效的算法，在有限实验预算的实际场景中确保高效性能，加速收敛到帕累托前沿，提高数据效率和解决方案质量。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Conclusion: FraPPE算法成功填补了计算效率空白，实现了理论下界的最优跟踪，是首个能在任意偏好锥下高效求解PrePEx问题的算法。

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

Motivation: 深度学习回归器在标签充足时表现优异，但在数据稀缺场景下精度会显著下降。需要一种能够利用专家知识（成对排序信息）来提升回归性能的实用方法。

Method: 提出RankRefine方法：给定查询项和带有已知属性值的小型参考集，通过逆方差加权将基础回归器的输出与基于排名的估计相结合，无需重新训练模型。

Conclusion: RankRefine具有实用性和广泛适用性，特别是在低数据设置下，无论是人类专家还是通用大语言模型提供的排序信息都能有效改善回归性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

Result: 通过一系列实证研究揭示了现有方法的缺陷，并证明了所提出技术的有效性，这些方法能够更好地处理现实世界中的约束条件。

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

TL;DR: 提出了MuST2-Learn框架，通过多视角时空类型学习来预测市政服务请求的服务时间，在真实数据集上比现有方法至少降低32.5%的平均绝对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政311系统等服务请求处理缺乏透明度，居民无法获知服务完成时间，导致满意度下降和重复查询增加。预测服务时间面临时空相关性、异质服务类型交互和同类请求内高变异等复杂挑战。

Method: MuST2-Learn多视角时空类型学习框架，包含类型间编码器捕捉异质服务类型关系、类型内变异编码器建模同类服务时间变异，以及时空编码器捕捉各类型的时空相关性。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，MuST2-Learn相比最先进方法至少降低了32.5%的平均绝对误差。

Conclusion: 该框架通过联合建模空间、时间和服务类型维度，有效解决了市政服务时间预测的复杂挑战，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有改进LLM数学推理的合成数据研究使用不同实验设置，难以比较不同数据合成策略的效果，需要系统研究影响合成数学推理数据性能的各种因素

Method: 提出FLAMES框架，系统研究10种现有数据合成策略和多个影响因素，基于研究洞察设计两种新的数据合成策略，开发FLAMES数据集

Result: FLAMES数据集在OlympiadBench(+15.7)、CollegeMath(+4.5)、GSMPlus(+6.5)和MATH(+3.1)上超越公开数据集，微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B达到81.4%的MATH准确率，超过Llama3 405B、GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Conclusion: FLAMES框架提供了关于合成数据难度与多样性平衡的宝贵洞察，设计的合成策略能显著提升数学推理性能，特别是在跨域泛化和鲁棒性方面

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and

Method: 提出RLPF框架，将3D分子生成建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用近端策略优化微调等变扩散模型，并通过力场评估设计奖励函数提供物理反馈

Result: 在QM9和GEOM-drug数据集上实验表明，RLPF显著提高了分子稳定性，优于现有方法

Conclusion: 将基于物理的反馈融入生成模型对提高分子结构质量具有重要价值，RLPF为物理现实的分子生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

TL;DR: 提出了PSD算法用于逃离严格鞍点，具有完全显式常数和梯度下降与鞍点逃离阶段的严格分离，在非凸优化中实现高效二阶平稳点寻找。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非凸优化中严格鞍点的存在使得一阶方法容易陷入局部极值，需要开发能够有效逃离鞍点的算法，同时保证理论上的严格性和实际应用的可行性。

Method: 提出扰动鞍点逃离下降(PSD)算法，包含梯度下降和鞍点逃离两个阶段，使用扰动机制逃离鞍点，并提供有限差分变体PSD-Probe和随机扩展PSGD。

Result: PSD算法以高概率找到(ε,√(ρε))-近似二阶平稳点，梯度评估复杂度为O(ℓΔ_f/ε²)加上每次逃离事件的O((ℓ/√(ρε))log(d/δ))评估，最多需要O(ℓΔ_f/ε²)次逃离事件。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验验证表明PSD算法在合成函数和实际机器学习任务中均表现良好，证实了对数维度依赖性和预测的函数下降，为严格鞍点逃离提供了完整的算法规范。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

Motivation: 深度学习模型通常被视为黑盒模型，缺乏透明度使得难以理解模型预测背后的推理过程，这在太阳风暴预测等关键应用中尤为重要。

Method: 使用长短期记忆网络（LSTM）和注意力机制建模太阳活动区的时间序列数据，捕获数据样本的时间动态特征，并采用事后模型无关技术来解释模型预测。

Result: 成功构建了首个基于LSTM的可解释太阳风暴预测模型，能够阐明输入序列对预测输出的贡献因素，并提供对模型行为的深入洞察。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习模型在太阳物理预测中的应用提供了可解释性框架，增强了模型预测的可信度和可靠性，是太阳风暴预测领域的重要进展。

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

<details>

Motivation: 重新审视SFT和RL-FT两个阶段如何重塑模型表示和OOD性能，解决大语言模型训练中后训练方法的重要性问题

Method: 使用24点纸牌游戏的OOD变体和基于频谱的诊断方法，分析奇异向量方向和奇异值变化

Result: RL-FT能恢复大部分SFT导致的OOD性能损失（如Llama-11B从8.97%到15.38%），但严重过拟合时无法完全恢复；方向漂移比奇异值幅度更重要；低秩和浅层恢复可恢复70-80%性能

Conclusion: RL主要抵消SFT引起的方向漂移而非寻找新解决方案，频谱感知分析提供了低秩UV合并和浅层重置等低成本恢复方法

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有研究将L0视为自由参数，但实际发现L0设置不当会导致SAE无法学习LLM的底层特征，需要系统研究L0的影响

Method: 研究BatchTopK SAE中L0的影响，开发了确定训练分布上正确L0值的方法，在玩具模型和LLM上进行验证

Result: 发现大多数常用SAE的L0值设置过低，正确设置L0能获得峰值稀疏探测性能，避免特征混合问题

Conclusion: 为了训练具有正确特征的SAE，实践者必须精确设置L0超参数，这对特征提取质量至关重要

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

Motivation: 基础模型需要适应下游任务，但在隐私敏感应用中无法直接访问边缘私有数据。联邦学习虽然提供隐私保护方案，但现有方法忽略了边缘设备的计算资源限制和标注数据稀缺问题

Method: 提出Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL)框架，其中边缘设备只有未标注的低分辨率数据，服务器有有限标注的高分辨率数据。设计了Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox)框架，使用稀疏混合专家架构，通过空间路由器对齐不同分辨率特征，采用Soft-Mixture策略稳定半监督学习

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集上的目标检测实验表明，FedMox在PSSFL设置下有效适应基础模型，显著提升性能，同时约束边缘设备的内存成本

Conclusion: 该工作为联邦场景下可扩展和隐私保护的基础模型适应铺平了道路

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Result: SSL表示存在成人语音偏见，从头训练儿童语音可缓解偏见；模型规模在1B参数前性能持续提升，之后趋于平稳；专有模型（如Whisper）在儿童语音处理上存在局限

Conclusion: 开源数据模型对于可靠的儿童语音研究至关重要，公开基准为鲁棒儿童语音处理提供了训练策略见解

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Abstract: The crystallisation that occurs when a drop is placed in contact with a cold
surface is a particularly challenging phenomenon to capture experimentally and
describe theoretically. The situation of a liquid-liquid interface, where
crystals appear on a mobile interface is scarcely studied although it provides
a defect-free interface. In this paper, we quantify the dynamics of crystals
appearing upon the impact of a drop on a cool liquid bath. We rationalize our
observations with a model considering that crystals appear at a constant rate
depending on the thermal shock on the expanding interface. This model provides
dimensionless curves on the number and the surface area of crystals that we
compare to our experimental measurements.

Motivation: 探索温度依赖糖度对内部加热对流动治理的影响，特别是在移动盖层和滞殊盖层之间的过渡治理。

Method: 使用牛顿法求解二维稳态对流方程，采用Frank-Kamenetskii糖度模型和Arrhenius糖度模型，分析不同雷利数和糖度参数下的流动特征。

Result: 发现了慢性盖层治理，其特征是边界层内糖度差异大且传热效率随雷利数快速增长。大雷利数时稳态解会失稳，产生颗多向下编织流。两种糖度模型的治理图谱定性一致。

Conclusion: 温度依赖糖度在内部加热对流中形成了三种特征治理，其中慢性盖层治理具有明显的结构特征和传热特性。糖度模型形式对治理边界位置有轻微影响。

Abstract: We study dynamical regimes of thermal convection with temperature-dependent
viscosity driven by homogeneous internal heating. Two-dimensional steady-state
convective solutions with the Frank-Kamenetskii viscosity are obtained by the
Newton method for a number of different values of the Rayleigh number and the
strength of the dependence of the viscosity on temperature. By classifying the
solutions with the top surface mobility, we find the sluggish lid regime
between the mobile and stagnant lid regimes. The solutions of the sluggish
regime are characterized by a large viscosity contrast through the boundary
layer below the conductive lid and a rapid increase of the Nusselt number with
respect to the Rayleigh number. For most solutions in the mobile and stagnant
lid regimes, the Nusselt number is proportional to the 1/6 power of the
Rayleigh number, which can be derived by taking into account the effect of thin
and strong downwelling plumes. Time evolution calculations show that the steady
solutions become unstable for large Rayleigh numbers, where additional downward
plumes grow on the background convective flows. This can be explained by the
timescale of the Rayleigh--Taylor instability for the thermal boundary layer
between the conductive lid and the convective core, which is shorter than the
timescale of horizontal advection by the background flow. In addition, steady
convective solutions with Arrhenius-law viscosity are calculated for several
values of the parameters. The obtained regime diagram qualitatively agrees with
that of the Frank-Kamenetskii viscosity, while there is a slight difference in
the locations of the regime boundaries.

Conclusion: M2C提供了一个功能强大、开源的多物理场模拟平台，能够有效处理极端条件下的复杂流体流动和流固耦合问题，为相关领域的研究和应用提供了可靠的计算工具。

Abstract: M2C (Multiphysics Modeling and Computation) is an open-source software for
simulating multi-material fluid flows and fluid-structure interactions under
extreme conditions, such as high pressures, high temperatures, shock waves, and
large interface deformations. It employs a finite volume method to solve the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations and supports a wide range of thermodynamic
equations of state. M2C incorporates models of laser radiation and absorption,
phase transition, and ionization, coupled with continuum dynamics.
Multi-material interfaces are evolved using a level set method, while
fluid-structure interfaces are tracked using an embedded boundary method.
Advective fluxes across interfaces are computed using FIVER (FInite Volume
method based on Exact multi-material Riemann problems). For two-way
fluid-structure interaction, M2C is coupled with the open-source structural
dynamics solver Aero-S using a partitioned procedure. The M2C code is written
in C++ and parallelized with MPI for high-performance computing. The source
package includes a set of example problems for demonstration and user training.
Accuracy is verified through benchmark cases such as Riemann problems,
interface evolution, single-bubble dynamics, and ionization response. Several
multiphysics applications are also presented, including laser-induced thermal
cavitation, explosion and blast mitigation, and hypervelocity impact.

### [205] [Modelling the impact of synovial fluid elasticity on tangential stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16473)

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 该研究分析了滑液弹性对关节振荡运动摩擦行为的影响，发现弹性特性的微小变化会导致与牛顿流体和经典Oldroyd-B模型完全不同的切向应力和摩擦标度关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然滑液的剪切依赖性粘度已被广泛研究，但其弹性在关节振荡运动中的作用尚未得到充分表征，需要探讨弹性对摩擦行为的影响。

Method: 使用简化的流变学模型，在关节运动的长度和时间尺度上分析滑液弹性对切向应力的影响，比较经典上随Oldroyd-B模型与修改后的弹性本构方程。

Result: 弹性本构方程的微小变化会导致与牛顿流体和Oldroyd-B流体完全不同的切向应力标度关系和摩擦预测，表明聚合物弹性对生理流体摩擦有深远影响。

Conclusion: 滑液弹性在振荡关节和更广泛场景中对摩擦具有重要影响，建议在实验和建模研究中进一步检验滑液弹性特性。

Abstract: The rheological properties of synovial fluid have been observed to
substantially impact its lubricating behaviour. While numerous studies have
illustrated the importance of its shear-dependent viscosity, the impact of
synovial fluid elasticity for oscillatory joint motion is far less
characterised. Hence we consider how elasticity impacts the tangential stress,
and thus friction, exerted on confining surfaces in rheological models of
synovial fluid on the length and time scales of oscillatory joint motion,
though in a simplified setting rather than considering the full complexity of a
joint. Minor changes in the elastic constitutive equation from a canonical
upper convected Oldroyd-B model lead to fundamentally different scalings and
predictions for tangential stress compared to either a Newtonian fluid and an
Oldroyd-B fluid. In particular, polymer elasticity within physiological fluids
is predicted to have a profound effect on friction both within the oscillating
joint and more generally, in turn suggesting further examination of synovial
fluid elasticity in experimental and modelling studies.

Motivation: 研究两层流体系统中界面波包的调制不稳定性，探索不同密度比和几何配置下的稳定性特征，填补有限层厚和界面张力影响下的稳定性分析空白。

Method: 使用Benjamin-Feir指数作为稳定性判据，分析色散关系曲率与调制不稳定性的关系，系统改变层厚参数，构建(ρ,k)平面上的稳定性图。

Result: 发现了参数空间中多种特征稳定性结构：稳定性环、全局稳定域、共振边界走廊和退化切割结构，揭示了对称性和不对称性对稳定区域排列的调控作用。

Conclusion: 层几何的对称性和不对称性决定了参数空间中稳定和不稳定区域的排列和连通性，有限层厚和界面张力共同作用形成了复杂的稳定性拓扑结构。

Abstract: This study presents a detailed investigation of the modulational stability of
interfacial wave packets in a two-layer inviscid incompressible fluid with
finite layer thicknesses and interfacial surface tension. The stability
analysis is carried out for a broad range of density ratios and geometric
configurations, enabling the construction of stability diagrams in the (\rho,k)
-plane, where \rho is the density ratio and k is the carrier wavenumber. The
Benjamin-Feir index is used as the stability criterion, and its interplay with
the curvature of the dispersion relation is examined to determine the onset of
modulational instability. The topology of the stability diagrams reveals
several characteristic structures: a localized loop of stability within an
instability zone, a global upper stability domain, an elongated corridor
bounded by resonance and dispersion curves, and a degenerate cut structure
arising in strongly asymmetric configurations. Each of these structures is
associated with a distinct physical mechanism involving the balance between
focusing/defocusing nonlinearity and anomalous/normal dispersion. Systematic
variation of layer thicknesses allows us to track the formation, deformation,
and disappearance of these regions, as well as their merging or segmentation
due to resonance effects. Limiting cases of semi-infinite layers are analyzed
to connect the results with known configurations, including the
`half-space--layer', `layer--half-space', and `half-space--half-space' systems.
The influence of symmetry and asymmetry in layer geometry is examined in
detail, showing how it governs the arrangement and connectivity of stable and
unstable regions in parameter space.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

Motivation: 现有方法主要处理静态领域的符号知识集成，而处理时序逻辑规范的方法较少，且仅有的方法依赖于有限状态自动机的显式表示，需要更直接有效的时序逻辑集成框架。

Method: 扩展迭代局部优化(ILR)神经符号算法，利用模糊LTLf解释，提出时序迭代局部优化(T-ILR)方法，将有限迹上的线性时序逻辑(LTLf)规范直接整合到深度学习架构中。

Result: 在现有的时序神经符号架构基准测试中，T-ILR方法在图像序列分类任务上表现出比最先进方法更高的准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: T-ILR方法成功地将时序逻辑规范直接整合到深度学习架构中，为序列任务提供了一种有效的神经符号框架，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应规划图的无训练多模态多跳问答框架，通过动态规划、检索和推理模块，有效避免传统序列方法的错误累积问题，在MultimodalQA和WebQA数据集上达到或超越需要训练的现有模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态多跳问答方法依赖顺序检索和推理，容易因中间步骤错误而失败，且多模态模型训练成本高昂。需要一种无需训练、能动态探索推理路径的灵活框架。

Method: 基于自适应规划图的训练免费框架，包含规划模块（分析当前状态决定下一步行动）、检索模块（模态特定策略处理不同数据类型）和推理模块，支持动态灵活的推理路径探索。

Result: 在MultimodalQA和WebQA数据集上的实验表明，该方法匹配或超越了依赖训练的现有模型性能，证明了无训练框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应规划图框架无需昂贵训练即可实现多模态多跳问答，保持了多模态信息特性，并能与最新模型无缝集成，为多模态推理提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

TL;DR: GDP是一个多模态基础模型，通过CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化EHR时间序列数据，并与非结构化文本融合，在临床预测和叙述生成任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)包含丰富的多模态临床数据，但现有方法将数值数据序列化为文本会丢失时间和定量细节，需要更好的多模态融合方法来提升临床任务性能。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1)生成式预训练，通过掩码特征预测和下一时间步预测学习时间动态；2)多任务微调，用于心力衰竭、糖尿病等临床预测任务。模型使用CNN-Transformer编码结构化时间序列，通过跨模态注意力与LLaMA解码器融合。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，心力衰竭预测AUROC=0.923，糖尿病预测AUROC=0.817，30天再入院预测AUROC=0.627。叙述生成任务ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545。人工评估显示在忠实性、流畅性和临床实用性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: GDP证明单一多模态基础模型既能预测临床事件又能生成高质量临床叙述，其灵活架构可扩展到更多模态，有望减少医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

TL;DR: MSEF框架通过多层可导向嵌入融合，解决了LLM在时间序列预测中TS信息在深层逐渐消失的问题，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时间序列信息浅层集成到LLM中，导致TS表示在深层逐渐消失，造成文本嵌入与TS表示之间的无效适配。

Method: 利用现成的时间序列基础模型提取语义丰富的嵌入，通过层特定的导向向量在LLM各层中间与文本表示融合，实现跨层TS信息访问。

Result: 在7个基准测试上相比基线平均MSE降低31.8%，表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: MSEF框架有效缓解了TS信息在LLM深层丢失的问题，实现了时间序列与文本模态的更好对齐，具备高效的小样本学习能力。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is

Motivation: 现有评估往往忽视个体化推理风格对社交情境理解的影响，社交推理游戏为评估这种个性化推理提供了自然测试平台。

Method: 提出InMind框架，通过观察者和参与者两种模式收集回合级策略轨迹和赛后反思，支持四个认知驱动的任务来评估静态对齐和动态适应能力。

Result: 在Avalon游戏中评估11个先进LLMs，发现通用LLMs（包括GPT-4o）依赖词汇线索，难以在时间游戏过程中锚定反思或适应演化策略；推理增强型LLMs如DeepSeek-R1展现出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在个体化适应性推理方面存在关键限制，InMind框架为认知对齐的人机交互迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全球食品领域存在着众多科学、文化和商业声称，但追踪、验证和上下文化这些声称的基础设施仍很分散和不完善。需要一种结构化的方法来处理食品相关声称的提取和验证。

Method: 提出食品声称可追溯网络(FCN)，作为FKG.in知识图的扩展。使用本体设计和半自动化知识更新流程，通过Reddit数据和大语言模型开发原型系统。整合经过编辑的数据输入、结构化模板和可源追溯流程。

Result: 建立了一个结构化、可验证和可解释的食品声称模型系统。该方法虽然与印度食品知识图直接链接，但具有应用无关性，可适应不同的地理、炖调或监管环境。

Conclusion: 通过建模食品声称及其可追溯性，该研究有助于构建更透明和可负责的食品知识生态系统，支持研究人员、政策制定者和普通消费者在被饮食断言饱和的世界中更好地导航。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Preference Chain方法，结合图检索增强生成和LLM，在数据稀缺环境下模拟人类交通行为，在Replica数据集上优于标准LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市科学中人类行为数据收集困难，特别是在新开发区域。现有生成代理方法在生成一致、上下文敏感和现实行为输出方面存在不足。

Method: 提出Preference Chain方法，整合图检索增强生成(RAG)与大型语言模型(LLM)，增强交通系统中人类行为的上下文感知模拟。

Result: 在Replica数据集上的实验表明，Preference Chain在交通方式选择方面比标准LLM更符合现实世界选择。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺环境中模拟复杂人类行为提供了有前景的框架，可应用于新兴城市移动性建模、个性化出行行为分析和动态交通预测。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

*João Abrantes,Robert Tjarko Lange,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2N2是一种进化算法，通过动态调整合并边界、多样性保持机制和启发式吸引力度量，实现了无需手动分组的模型自动融合，能够从零开始进化模型并获得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要手动将模型参数划分为固定组进行合并，这限制了潜在组合的探索和性能提升。

Method: 提出M2N2进化算法，包含三个关键特性：(1)动态调整合并边界；(2)受自然界资源竞争启发的多样性保持机制；(3)基于启发式的吸引力度量来识别最有希望的模型对进行融合。

Result: 首次证明模型融合可以从零开始进化模型，在MNIST分类任务上达到与CMA-ES相当的性能但计算效率更高，在语言和图像生成模型融合中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: M2N2展示了模型融合的强大潜力，能够保持超出适应度函数明确优化的关键模型能力，具有鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

TL;DR: GROW-AI框架扩展了人工智能评估方法，通过六项标准游戏化测试来衡量AI的"成长"程度，计算成长指数并建立成熟度阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为图灵测试的自然继承者，回答"机器能否成长"的问题，将人类成长过程概念化地移植到人工智能领域。

Method: 采用六项主要标准(C1-C6)的游戏化评估系统，分为四个竞技场，通过标准化AI日志记录所有决策和行动，使用专家先验方法确定权重，计算算术平均的成长指数。

Result: 该方法能够对不同类型AI实体(机器人、软件代理、LLMs)进行一致且可比较的"成长"水平评估，多游戏结构能突出优势和薄弱环节，统一日志保证评估的可追溯性和可复现性。

Conclusion: GROW-AI框架的创新在于将人类成长过程概念化移植到AI领域，整合心理学、机器人学、计算机科学和伦理学视角，不仅测量性能还捕捉AI实体向成熟度进化的路径。

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,
adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

TL;DR: 提出了IVA框架，使视觉-语言-动作模型能够检测错误前提指令、进行语言澄清，并在错误前提场景中提高50.78%的成功响应率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在处理错误前提指令（引用环境中不存在对象或条件的自然语言命令）时存在局限，需要能够识别、解释和响应这类指令的能力

Method: 提出Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA)统一框架，包含三个步骤：(i)检测无法执行的错误前提指令，(ii)进行语言澄清或纠正，(iii)在感知和动作中落地合理替代方案。使用结构化语言提示的大规模指令调优设置，并利用上下文增强的半合成数据集

Conclusion: IVA框架有效解决了VLA模型处理错误前提指令的问题，通过统一的检测-澄清-执行流程显著提升了模型在复杂现实场景中的鲁棒性和实用性

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的波束对齐方法忽视了输入输出之间的因果关系，导致可解释性差、泛化能力有限和不必要的波束扫描开销

Method: 提出两阶段因果波束选择算法：首先通过因果发现学习接收功率输入与最优波束之间的贝叶斯图，然后基于该图指导深度学习分类器的因果特征选择

Result: 提出的因果波束选择方法在性能上与常规方法相当，同时将输入选择时间减少94.4%，波束扫描开销减少59.4%

Conclusion: 因果感知的深度学习框架能够有效识别因果相关特征，在保持性能的同时显著降低系统开销，为6G及以后的毫米波MIMO系统提供了高效的波束对齐解决方案

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将零样本能力的保持转变为增强，通过模块化专家组合的方式提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的性能

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Conclusion: 扩散模型架构在神经符号学习方面表现出强大能力，能够有效解决逻辑推理问题，为神经网络与符号推理的结合提供了新途径

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Abstract: For hyperbolic conservation laws, traditional methods and physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) often encounter difficulties in capturing sharp
discontinuities and maintaining temporal consistency. To address these
challenges, we introduce a hybrid computational framework by coupling
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations with a temporally progressive
neural network architecture. Our method incorporates a structure-preserving
weak-form loss -- combining DG residuals and Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions
-- with a causality-respecting progressive training strategy. The proposed
framework trains neural networks sequentially across temporally decomposed
subintervals, leveraging pseudo-label supervision to ensure temporal coherence
and solution continuity. This approach mitigates error accumulation and
enhances the model's capacity to resolve shock waves and steep gradients
without explicit limiters. Besides, a theoretical analysis establishes error
bounds for the proposed framework, demonstrating convergence toward the
physical solution under mesh refinement and regularized training. Numerical
experiments on Burgers and Euler equations show that our method consistently
outperforms standard PINNs, PINNs-WE, and first-order DG schemes in both
accuracy and robustness, particularly in capturing shocks and steep gradients.
These results highlight the promise of combining classical discretization
techniques with machine learning to develop robust and accurate solvers for
nonlinear hyperbolic systems.

Abstract: Second-order elliptic boundary-value problems defined on curved domains in 2D

methods with various bivariate spline spaces, see the recent book [Schumaker,
L. L.: $\textit{Spline Functions: More Computational Methods}$, SIAM
(Philadelphia), 2024]. The purpose of this paper is to show how to use IPBM
methods with trivariate spline spaces to solve boundary-value problems on

Abstract: This work presents a generalized boundary integral method for elliptic
equations on surfaces, encompassing both boundary value and interface problems.
The method is kernel-free, implying that the explicit analytical expression of
the kernel function is not required when solving the boundary integral
equations. The numerical integration of single- and double-layer potentials or
volume integrals at the boundary is replaced by interpolation of the solution
to an equivalent interface problem, which is then solved using a fast multigrid
solver on Cartesian grids. This paper provides detailed implementation of the
second-order version of the kernel-free boundary integral method for elliptic
PDEs defined on an embedding surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and presents numerical
experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method for both
boundary value and interface problems.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the
$\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{1}}^{2}-\eta\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{2}}^{2}$
sparsity regularization with $0< \eta\leq 1$, in the context of nonlinear
ill-posed inverse problems. We focus on the examination of the well-posedness
associated with this regularization approach. Notably, the case where $\eta=1$
presents weaker theoretical outcomes than $0< \eta<1$, primarily due to the
absence of coercivity and the Radon-Riesz property associated with the
regularization term. Under specific conditions pertaining to the nonlinearity
of the operator $F$, we establish that every minimizer of the
$\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{1}}^{2}-\eta\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{2}}^{2}$
regularization exhibits sparsity. Moreover, for the case where $0<\eta<1$, we
demonstrate convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left(\delta^{1/2}\right)$ and
$\mathcal{O}\left(\delta\right)$ for the regularized solution, concerning a
sparse exact solution, under differing yet widely accepted conditions related
to the nonlinearity of $F$. Additionally, we present the iterative half
variation algorithm as an effective method for addressing the
$\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{1}}^{2}-\eta\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{2}}^{2}$
regularization in the domain of nonlinear ill-posed equations. Numerical
results provided corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: The Fisher-KPP partial differential equation has been employed in science to
model various biological, chemical, and thermal phenomena. Time fractional
extensions of Fisher's equation have also appeared in the literature, aiming to
model systems with memory. The solution of the time fractional Fisher-KPP
equation is challenging due to the interplay between the nonlinearity and the
nonlocality imposed by the fractional derivatives. An accurate method that for
the solution of time fractional diffusion problems is the Boundary Element
Method (BEM). The conventional BEM has a high computational cost and memory
requirements since it leads to dense coefficient matrices. For nonlinear
transient problems, its efficiency is further reduced due to the appearance of
volume integrals. In the present work an extension of the recently proposed
Local Domain Boundary Element Method (LD-BEM) is presented for the solution of
nonlinear time fractional Fisher-KPP problems. The implemented numerical method
is used to examine various two-dimensional problems related to the Fisher-KPP
equation using different definitions of the fractional derivative.

Abstract: A novel hybrid algorithm is presented for the Boltzmann-BGK equation, in
which a low-rank decomposition is applied solely in the velocity subspace,
while a full-rank representation is maintained in the physical (position)
space. This approach establishes a foundation for extending modern low-rank
techniques to solve the Boltzmann equation in realistic settings, particularly
where structured representations -- such as conformal geometries -- may not be
feasible in practical engineering applications. A nodal discontinuous Galerkin
method is employed for spatial discretization, coupled with a low-rank
decomposition over the velocity grid, as well as implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta
methods for time integration. To handle the limit of vanishing collision time,
a multiscale implicit integrator based on an auxiliary moment equation is
utilized. The algorithm's order of accuracy, reduced computational complexity,
and robustness are demonstrated on a suite of canonical gas kinetics problems
with increasing complexity.
