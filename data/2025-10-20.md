### [1] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE是一个自动化流水线，能将原始长视频转换为高质量的多模态世界模型训练数据，通过AI模型进行密集预标注，显著提升标注效率并减少人工审核量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练鲁棒的世界模型需要大规模、精确标注的多模态数据集，但传统手动标注过程缓慢且昂贵，需要自动化解决方案来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 系统包含三个步骤：(i) 将专有360度格式标准化为标准视图并分片处理；(ii) 应用AI模型套件进行场景理解、目标跟踪、音频转录等多模态预标注；(iii) 将信号整合为结构化输出规范供人工快速验证。

Result: GAZE工作流程显著提升效率（每审核小时节省约19分钟），通过保守自动跳过低显著性片段减少80%以上的人工审核量，生成高保真、隐私感知的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可扩展的蓝图，能在不牺牲吞吐量或治理的前提下生成高质量的世界模型训练数据，支持跨模态动态和动作条件预测的学习。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，用于PET图像降噪，通过整合物理数据提高图像保真度，解决低剂量PET图像中的泊松噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床应用中，高剂量会增加辐射暴露，降低剂量会引入泊松噪声，现有降噪方法无法有效处理这种噪声，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet)模型，提出Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss)，该损失函数在方差和梯度适应上具有统计无偏性，作为广义矩方法的实现，对轻微数据不匹配具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在PET数据集上的测试表明，PC-UNet提高了物理一致性和图像保真度，证明其有效整合物理信息的能力。

Conclusion: PC-UNet模型通过PVMC-Loss成功解决了低剂量PET图像中的泊松噪声问题，显著提升了图像质量，为临床PET应用提供了更安全的低剂量成像方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题，无需外部输入即可有效抑制实体间的过度交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在语义泄漏问题，即不同实体间语义相关特征的意外传递。现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入，需要更高效的方法。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时增强每个实体的身份特征。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，DeLeaker也能在不影响保真度或质量的情况下有效缓解泄漏。

Conclusion: 注意力控制具有重要价值，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注的3D城市资产库和自动生成管线，在导航任务中展现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手工制作或程序生成的仿真场景要么缺乏可扩展性，要么无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，而城市嵌入式AI代理需要多样化的高保真城市环境进行训练。

Method: UrbanVerse包含UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动管线）。

Result: UrbanVerse场景保持了真实世界的语义和布局，在人类评估的真实感方面与手工制作的场景相当。在导航任务中，相比先前方法，仿真中成功率提高+6.3%，零样本仿真到真实转移中提高+30.1%，在300米真实世界任务中仅需两次干预。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse通过数据驱动的方法成功创建了高保真、可扩展的城市仿真环境，显著提升了城市导航代理的训练效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练、无掩码的3D对象编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS集成实现局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge区域感知融合策略，在保持结构一致性的同时提升3D编辑质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D对象编辑方法存在效率低、不一致性以及未编辑区域保护不足的问题，多数方法依赖多视角渲染编辑后重建，导致伪影且实用性受限。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染引导局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge区域感知融合策略，自适应保持编辑与未编辑区域的结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，并构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k，包含超过10万个高质量3D编辑对。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性方面的长期挑战，显著提升了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈式3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

*Jiaxin Ge,Grace Luo,Heekyung Lee,Nishant Malpani,Long Lian,XuDong Wang,Aleksander Holynski,Trevor Darrell,Sewon Min,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体帖子构建图像生成模型基准测试，发现现有基准未能捕捉的新兴用例，并在GPT-4o Image Gen上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成基准往往滞后于技术进步，无法捕捉新兴用例，导致社区对进展的认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和用户定性判断的社交媒体帖子中直接构建基准，收集了超过31,000个提示构建数据集。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准中缺失的创意复杂任务，能更好地区分最先进模型与替代方案，并通过社区反馈指导模型质量度量设计。

Conclusion: 基于真实使用证据的基准构建方法能更准确地反映图像生成模型的实际能力和用户需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于子模框架的方法来解决从海量LoRA适配器中选择最相关和多样化模型的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有超过10万个LoRA适配器可用，但由于数量庞大、多样性高且缺乏结构化组织，用户在选择和使用最合适的适配器时面临挑战

Method: 将任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出新颖的子模框架

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能在广泛领域中生成多样化的输出

Conclusion: 所提出的子模框架有效解决了从大规模LoRA适配器数据库中选择相关且多样化模型的问题

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型系列，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持SOTA性能，仅需1/3训练迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型计算成本高，限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计能够在不牺牲性能的情况下实现高效边缘部署的架构。

Method: 提出瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；语言引导不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；统一的训练策略。

Result: 相比高效基线模型，MOBIUS在减少大量计算开销的同时保持了最先进的性能，在高性能计算平台和移动设备上都建立了新的效率基准。

Conclusion: MOBIUS实现了帕累托最优的向下扩展，支持从高端加速器到移动硬件的跨设备部署，为高效分割设定了新标准。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS框架通过分解种子问题为感知和推理因子，然后系统重组生成大量合成问答对，有效提升多模态大语言模型在图表等人工图像领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在缺乏大规模人工标注推理数据的人工图像领域（如图表、文档、网页）的推理能力限制问题。

Method: 将种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因子，然后与新的图像系统重组生成合成问答对，并配合子问题和中间答案进行因子级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理任务上显著提升对未见问题的性能，特别是在推理密集和组合问题上效果最明显，且能实现跨数据集的良好迁移。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够有效提升多模态大语言模型在人工图像领域的推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性，可扩展到网页等其他领域。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

*Yichen Li,Zhiyi Li,Brandon Feng,Dinghuai Zhang,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个从势能角度统一刚体、铰接体和软体动力学的框架，通过引入方向刚度来扩展经典弹性动力学，能够从简单运动观察中推断物理属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界为开发通用具身智能体提供了新机会，但需要能够处理复杂物理行为的统一动力学系统。

Method: 采用势能视角，引入方向刚度扩展经典弹性动力学，使用专门网络建模扩展材料属性，并用神经场以几何无关方式表示变形。

Result: 实验表明GDGen能够稳健地统一多种仿真范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人智能体提供多功能基础。

Conclusion: GDGen提供了一个统一框架，能够无缝整合不同物理系统，为复杂动态场景中的虚拟环境和机器人训练提供支持。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练，缓解3D医学影像领域数据不足的问题，在多个任务上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像领域的数据稀缺限制了当前视觉-语言编码器的能力，需要解决数据不足的问题来提升模型性能。

Method: 引入报告生成目标，结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练，利用图像-文本配对数据集和纯图像数据集，增加模型接触的数据量。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过引入额外的归纳偏置和结合不同预训练策略，可以有效缓解3D医学影像数据不足的问题，显著提升模型在多个下游任务上的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间转移推理知识来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免模型合并的不稳定性，以较低成本提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力通常落后于纯文本模型，现有方法需要大量资源进行监督微调或强化学习，而模型合并方法在不同模型家族中效果不稳定。

Method: DRIFT方法预计算推理先验作为推理变体与多模态变体之间的参数空间差异，在微调过程中用此先验来偏置梯度，实现推理知识的转移。

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT相比朴素合并和监督微调持续提升推理性能，以较低成本达到或超越资源密集型方法的性能。

Conclusion: DRIFT是一种轻量级方法，能够在保持多模态对齐的同时有效转移推理知识，为增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个用于长时序3D高斯泼溅重建的新框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点变换器，实现了冗余消除和几何一致性，能够在超过50个视图和10FPS下进行在线重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视图3D高斯泼溅重建中存在大量冗余和几何不一致问题，特别是在长时序视频序列中。

Method: 使用紧凑锚点基元通过可微分显著性感知高斯量化消除冗余，结合3D点变换器优化锚点属性和显著性，实现区域自适应高斯解码。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在50-90%的冗余消除下，能够在超过50个视图和10FPS下进行重建。

Conclusion: 该方法无需已知相机参数或测试时优化，在单次前向传播中有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS，展示了在长时序通用3D重建中的优越效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT是一个文本引导轨迹框架，通过点轨迹作为直观运动控制手柄，结合局部文本描述来控制视频生成中的外观和运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在控制场景主体组合方面能力有限，特别是在复杂多对象场景中，缺乏轨迹与视觉实体之间的清晰对应关系。

Method: 提出位置感知交叉注意力机制和双CFG方案，分别调节局部和全局文本引导，并开发了数据处理流程来生成带有跟踪实体局部描述的轨迹。

Result: TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐准确性和运动可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过轨迹与文本的配对，实现了对视频生成中外观和运动的精确控制，在多对象复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯逆问题在神经成像中依赖经典数学先验，难以捕捉脑解剖的复杂结构，而扩散模型作为强大的生成模型尚未有效结合领域知识来指导脑成像问题。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散先验，在多样化的脑MRI数据上进行训练，配合灵活的前向模型来处理超分辨率、偏置场校正、修复等常见图像处理任务。

Conclusion: 扩散先验作为脑MRI分析的通用工具具有巨大潜力，能够提高解剖保真度并改进现有深度学习方法的结果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了FFT-MIL框架，通过傅里叶变换在频域中提取全局上下文信息，增强全切片图像分类中的多示例学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多示例学习的全切片图像分类方法难以捕捉全局依赖关系，因为图像尺寸巨大且补丁嵌入具有局部性，这限制了粗粒度结构的建模能力

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频分量，通过包含卷积层和Min-Max归一化的FFT-Block处理，然后将学习到的全局频域特征与空间补丁特征融合

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了六种最先进的MIL方法，集成FFT-Block后平均提高了3.51%的宏F1分数和1.51%的AUC

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕捉WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效且高效机制，能够补充空间特征并提升基于MIL的计算病理学的可扩展性和准确性

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了XModBench基准测试，用于评估全模态大语言模型的跨模态一致性，发现现有模型在空间和时间推理、模态差异和方向不平衡方面存在显著问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估一般跨模态问答能力，但无法确定全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理，还是存在模态特定偏差。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的大规模三模态基准XModBench，涵盖五种任务家族和所有六种模态组合，能够精细诊断模型的模态不变推理、模态差异和方向不平衡。

Result: 实验显示，即使最强的Gemini 2.5 Pro模型也存在：(i)空间和时间推理能力不足（准确率低于60%），(ii)持续模态差异（音频模态性能显著下降），(iii)系统性方向不平衡（视觉作为上下文时一致性较低）。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型远未实现真正的模态不变推理，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基本诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

TL;DR: 提出UniFilter作为统一多模态数据质量分类器，用于过滤高质量图像文本描述和交错文档数据，通过半合成方法生成训练数据，显著提升MLLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像文本描述数据和交错文档数据上持续预训练，但对图像文本交错文档数据的高质量数据过滤研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成对应文本，创建四个质量等级的样本-分数对，训练UniFilter分类器来过滤DataComp和OBELICS数据集中的高质量数据。

Result: 在过滤数据上预训练的MLLM相比基线数据训练的模型，展现出显著增强的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter能有效提升多模态预训练数据质量，带来下游任务性能增益，相关数据和模型已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

Motivation: 解决组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性挑战，包括软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致等问题。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置（如RandomResizedCrop值、分布式训练策略、学习率）和数据增强策略在三个下游组织病理学数据集上的影响。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值0.7-0.8表现最佳，分布式训练无局部损失提高了稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会降低性能，LC25000（结肠）数据集提供了最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学的可重复性不仅需要透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，研究为开发可重复的数字病理学基础模型提供了实用指导规则。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本提示的生成数据增强方法难以平衡保真度和多样性，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中不相关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，通过生成更好地保留类别判别特征并具有额外受控变化的图像来增强训练数据多样性。

Result: 在八个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出优越性能，在常规和长尾设置下分别以0.73%和6.5%的平均分类准确率提升优于最先进的增强方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少不相关视觉细节的影响，有效增强了训练数据集的多样性，从而提高了下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Result: 在CARDIUM数据集上，多模态方法比图像和表格单模态方法分别提高了11%和50%的CHD检测性能，F1分数达到79.8±4.8%。

Conclusion: CARDIUM数据集和提出的多模态方法为产前CHD检测研究提供了有价值的资源，将公开数据集和代码以促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset
and code to encourage further research on this unexplored field. Our dataset

Conclusion: DriveGen3D成功解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了一种高效、可控的动态3D驾驶场景生成解决方案。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于单正多标签学习的双曲几何分类框架，将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，通过几何球体交互建模丰富的标签关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中每个训练样本仅标注一个正标签但可能属于多个类别的挑战，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义。

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球体交互同时建模包含关系（层次结构）、重叠关系（共现模式）和分离关系（语义独立），并引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双势阱正则化。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明具有竞争力的性能，且比现有方法具有更好的可解释性，统计分析显示学习到的嵌入与现实世界共现模式强相关。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成，解决了VAE+扩散范式在训练效率、推理速度和任务迁移性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、迁移性差的问题，这些问题源于VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有清晰语义判别性的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节，直接在语义结构化的潜在空间上训练扩散模型。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样、提高生成质量，并保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

TL;DR: CoMe是一个渐进式层剪枝框架，通过基于拼接的层合并技术和分层蒸馏后训练过程，有效减少大型语言模型的参数规模，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优秀，但巨大的规模导致高计算和存储需求。现有结构化剪枝方法存在性能下降、权重聚合能力不足以及缺乏有效后训练恢复机制等问题。

Method: 1) 使用基于激活强度和权重范数的通道敏感性指标进行细粒度通道选择；2) 采用基于拼接的层合并方法融合相邻层的关键通道；3) 提出分层蒸馏协议，利用原始模型与剪枝模型层间对应关系进行知识迁移。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，CoMe达到最先进性能。当剪枝LLaMA-2-7b模型30%参数时，剪枝后的模型仍保留83%的原始平均准确率。

Conclusion: CoMe通过渐进式剪枝和分层蒸馏，有效解决了结构化剪枝中的关键限制，在显著减少模型参数的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

Motivation: 现有面部关键点检测数据集定义不同数量的关键点，主流方法只能单数据集训练，限制了模型泛化能力和统一模型的发展。

Method: 提出Proto-Former框架，包含自适应原型感知编码器(APAE)和渐进式原型感知解码器(PPAD)，以及原型感知(PA)损失函数，实现多数据集联合训练。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上的实验表明，Proto-Former相比现有最先进方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习和多数据集训练，有效提升了面部关键点检测的泛化能力和性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏全面评估6D空间推理能力的框架，大型多模态模型在复杂3维空间推理方面的能力仍不确定。

Method: 创建了Spatial457合成数据集，包含4个关键空间推理能力：多目标识别、2D位置、3D位置和3D方向，采用级联评估结构构建了7种问题类型和5个难度级别。

Result: 评估显示大型多模态模型在3D推理和6D空间任务中表现较差，性能随任务复杂度增加而下降，并发现了不同属性间的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在复杂3D空间推理方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进以提升6D空间理解能力。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

TL;DR: SHARE是一种利用场景几何空间线索来精确重建人体运动的方法，仅需单目RGB视频即可实现人体在3D空间中的准确定位。


<details>

Motivation: 当前的人体运动重建方法在将人体准确放置在3D空间中存在困难，而真实的人物与环境交互对于游戏、AR/VR和机器人等领域的自主代理至关重要。

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点云图。通过迭代比较人体网格与使用掩码从场景提取的人体点云图，在关键帧上优化人体位置，并保持非关键帧与关键帧根关节的相对位置一致性。

Conclusion: SHARE通过利用场景几何线索，显著提升了单目视频中人体运动重建的3D定位精度，为各种应用场景提供了更可靠的人体-环境交互重建方案。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: EEG和ECoG信号在运动想象分类中具有重要应用价值，但易受生理伪影干扰。现有Transformer方法难以捕获细粒度依赖关系。

Method: 扩展深度状态空间模型，在时域、空域和频域三个维度上捕获EEG和ECoG信号的综合依赖关系。

Result: 在两个大规模公共MI EEG数据集和一个临床MI ECoG数据集上验证，均优于基线方法。可视化解释显示模型能有效捕获神经生理相关区域。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM模型能有效处理EEG和ECoG信号，在运动想象分类任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化工具检测具有重要意义，但手术场景中标注数据有限，训练鲁棒的深度学习模型面临挑战。

Method: 两阶段自适应微调：线性探测阶段在预训练CNN架构上调整分类层；渐进冻结阶段动态减少可微调层数，控制对手术领域的适应程度。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上，该方法相比现有方法和标准微调技术提升了检测性能，达到96.4%的mAP。在CATARACTS眼科手术数据集上进一步验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是提升多样化手术过程中工具存在检测的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Motivation: 当前多视图2D图像3D检测方法依赖深度预测恢复空间信息，但深度预测质量不佳，存在物体边界深度不连续、小物体难以区分等问题，且忽略了跨视图一致性和尺度不变性。

Method: 使用频率感知空间金字塔编码器(FSPE)结合高低频特征，跨视图尺度不变深度预测器(CSDP)估计像素级深度分布，位置深度编码器(PDE)生成3D深度感知特征，并采用混合深度监督。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FreqPDE方法能够有效提升多视图2D图像3D检测性能，无需LiDAR监督，解决了深度预测质量不佳的问题。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

TL;DR: PFGS是一个姿态感知的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过融合多姿态图像捕获来解决单姿态重建不完整的问题，实现了更完整的物体重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建结果不完整，遗漏被遮挡或自遮挡区域。

Method: 给定物体在一个主要姿态和多个辅助姿态下的图像，PFGS迭代地将每个辅助姿态集融合到主要姿态的统一3DGS表示中，采用姿态感知融合策略结合全局和局部配准。

Result: 实验结果表明PFGS在定性和定量评估中始终优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过智能整合3D基础模型到配准过程中，克服了高内存需求和精度不足的限制，实现了更完整和高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线运动风格化框架扩展到在线设置，解决了实时生成长序列风格化人体运动的关键挑战。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

Motivation: 现有水下实例分割方法受限于封闭词汇预测，无法识别新的海洋类别。水下开放词汇分割面临视觉退化（如颜色衰减）和语义错位（缺乏水下类别定义）的挑战。

Method: 提出统一框架，包含两个互补组件：几何先验增强模块（GPEM）利用稳定的部件级和结构线索在视觉退化条件下保持对象一致性；语义对齐注入机制（SAIM）用领域特定先验丰富语言嵌入，缓解语义模糊性。

Result: 实验表明该框架在MARIS基准上，无论是域内还是跨域设置，都持续优于现有的开放词汇基线方法。

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging

overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

TL;DR: 提出了LoD框架，通过任务特定学习而非攻击特定学习来检测未知的越狱攻击，包含多模态安全概念激活向量和无监督攻击分类模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数导致泛化性差，要么依赖启发式原则限制准确性和效率。

Method: LoD框架包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块进行安全导向表示学习，以及安全模式自动编码器模块进行无监督攻击分类。

Result: 在多样化未知攻击上实现了更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过任务特定学习有效检测未知越狱攻击，在准确性和效率方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

*Huan Chen,Ting Han,Siyu Chen,Zhihao Guo,Yiping Chen,Meiliu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic4Safety框架，使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型分析交通事故数据，通过XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像分析中的两个核心挑战：(1)如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标；(2)如何量化这些指标对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型作为上下文信息，分析约30,000条奥斯汀事故记录。训练XGBoost多类分类器，使用SHAP解释全局和局部特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 发现异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：捕捉场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何的特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度的视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持有针对性的干预措施和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了一个可扩展的、数据驱动的工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Predictive-Corrective（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务加速学习。PCMambaNet包含预测先验模块（PPM）和校正残差网络（CRN），在脑MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch即可达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端深度学习在数据稀缺领域（如医学影像）存在收敛慢、依赖大数据集的问题，限制了其效率和适用性。

Method: PC范式将建模任务解耦：PPM利用解剖知识（双侧对称性）生成低成本的粗略近似，CRN学习残差误差，专注于精炼挑战性区域和病理边界。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最先进精度，且仅需1-5个epoch收敛，这是传统端到端模型无法实现的。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让模型主动选择关键帧并进行局部重采样，解决长视频推理中的信息稀释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在长视频推理中存在信息稀释问题，静态均匀帧采样会掩盖关键证据，且现有像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度。

Method: 提出证据感知强化学习框架EARL，让模型作为证据的主动询问者，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节。

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中达到开源视频大语言模型的最新SOTA，7B模型在LongVideoBench上达到59.8%，MVBench上69.0%，VideoMME上64.9%。

Conclusion: 证据优先策略和EARL框架的有效性得到验证，能够学习到高效且高纯度的视觉证据选择策略。

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: MAVR-Net是一个基于多视角学习的微型飞行器动作识别框架，通过结合RGB帧、光流和分割掩码三种互补数据，提升MAV运动识别的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器提取各视角特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模模态依赖，设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上表现优异，在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的多视角学习方法显著提升了MAV动作识别的性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中，生成精确的提示来改善夜间跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致生成模糊提示，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力。

Method: DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中；最后基于通道类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核，定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示，结合空间门控实现鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核并生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间航拍跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了更准确的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

TL;DR: 提出基于动态图像的双阶段时间增强方法，将微表情序列分解为起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个运动阶段，分别生成动态图像，以丰富运动多样性和补充时间线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视时间增强策略，限制了运动模式的多样性捕捉。

Method: 将每个表情序列分解为起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段生成独立的动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均获得一致提升，结合空间增强可获得高达10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法在驾驶场景的多摄像头系统中存在姿态估计不可靠、路面重建异常点多和重建效率低的问题，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 利用多摄像头系统的固定空间关系增强姿态估计可靠性；采用平面模型去除三角化路面的错误点；将多摄像头作为单一单元进行BA优化减少变量；通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到0.124的绝对姿态误差，表现出最先进的性能；在实际车辆部署中验证了跨场景通用性和恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架有效解决了驾驶场景多摄像头SfM的关键挑战，在精度、效率和鲁棒性方面均表现出色，适用于大规模实际应用。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 结合光学流方法通过整合微表情的完整动态过程，显著提升了微表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the

a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Conclusion: 该管道支持集成任意最先进的3D重建方法，将公开发布重建管道的源代码，并提供包含多种作物在不同时间点采集的数据集

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Conclusion: HiMA架构通过有效结合不同模块的优势，在低光RAW图像增强任务中实现了效率与质量的平衡，为高效ISP提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

TL;DR: ORCA提出了一种利用预训练文本到图像扩散模型获取任务自适应视觉表示的方法，通过可学习的任务提示和视觉提示来适应机器人控制环境，无需微调模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉表示在模仿学习中通常保持冻结状态，导致任务无关性。本文探索如何利用文本到图像扩散模型获得任务自适应的视觉表示，以提升机器人控制性能。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，引入可学习的任务提示来适应控制环境，以及视觉提示来捕捉细粒度的帧级细节，通过新设计的条件促进任务自适应表示。

Result: 该方法在各种机器人控制基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑控制所需的特定动态视觉信息，ORCA成功地将预训练扩散模型应用于机器人控制，证明了任务自适应视觉表示的重要性。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control

Abstract: We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity
of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in
multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through
extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LFA是一种无需属性标签的算法，通过潜在方向识别子群体，在语义一致性和可解释性方面优于传统聚类方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型存在系统性偏见，传统偏见评估框架依赖标注属性，成本高且限于预定义类别

Method: 使用潜在特征对齐(LFA)算法，通过潜在方向识别子群体，实现语义一致分组和可解释方向发现

Result: 在四个先进识别模型和两个基准测试中，LFA在组内语义一致性方面持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，并发现与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，无需预定义属性标注即可识别和解释偏见子群体

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

*Aditya Vir*

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索空间和光谱特征在卫星影像中的重要性。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线模型、CBAM增强模型和平衡多任务注意力机制，结合Coordinate Attention和Squeeze-Excitation块，使用可学习融合参数统一空间和光谱特征提取。

Result: 最终12层架构达到Cohen's Kappa 0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%，与微调ResNet-50性能相差仅1.34%。

Conclusion: 系统化架构设计在特定领域应用中具有高效性，空间和光谱模态在卫星图像中具有近乎同等重要性。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中具有重要价值，但相比常规MRI，其可及性差且成本高昂。研究旨在开发一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的概率映射，仅需20个站点特定病例和基本人口统计信息即可部署。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，并获得更高的诊断确定性评分和评估者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易于获取，有望在资源有限环境中改善痴呆症的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在视觉退化和低资源环境下，特别是历史文档分析中的文本识别挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变化、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从二战档案视频中提取包含拍板的结构化生产元数据，提供全帧标注和裁剪单词图像，使用每视频一致性评估协议对6种识别模型和7种检测模型进行零样本和微调测试。

Result: 尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍带来显著的性能提升，证明了该数据集在少样本学习场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: ClapperText为在低资源档案环境中推进鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了现实且文化基础丰富的资源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于传统的单视角方法。

Conclusion: 通过融合多视角编码器的特征，该模型能够在各种视角和光照条件下有效检测被篡改的图像。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Conclusion: 该模型不仅是高效的模态转换工具，也是验证显微镜工作流程中实验准确性和图像保真度的实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Motivation: 时空图像融合方法通常需要不同传感器捕获的具有匹配空间和光谱分辨率的图像集，这限制了其应用。为了促进STIF方法的应用，需要开发标准化方法。

Method: 比较了两种标准化方法：1) 基于传统上采样的方法；2) 锐化方法ABSIS，将高分辨率图像序列的整体特征与特定低分辨率图像的独特属性相结合。

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP STIF方法的准确性，其中锐化方法将融合图像的光谱和空间精度分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法，特别是ABSIS锐化方法，能够有效提高时空图像融合的精度，促进STIF方法的应用。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

Motivation: 全监督医学图像分割需要大量像素级标注，成本高昂且耗时。为了减轻标注负担，需要开发仅需少量标注的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，能够以极低的标注成本获得高质量的分割结果。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of
3D body joint positions synchronized with fisheye camera images, as well as
accurate 3D pedestrian positions extracted from lidar data, facilitating robust
benchmarking for perception algorithms. We release a portion of the dataset
along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for
accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on embedded systems. By addressing
real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and
hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and
evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose
estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide
baseline performance metrics using custom neural network architectures and
suggest future research directions to encourage the adoption and enhancement of
the dataset. This work aims to serve as a foundation for researchers seeking to
advance the capabilities of intelligent vehicles in near-field scenarios.

TL;DR: OmniVinci是一个开源的多模态大语言模型项目，通过创新的模型架构和数据管理方法，在视觉和音频模态之间实现强对齐，使用仅0.2T训练token就在多个基准测试中超越了Qwen2.5-Omni。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进机器智能需要开发跨多模态的感知能力，就像人类感知世界一样。目标是构建强大的开源多模态LLM。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：(i) OmniAlignNet用于在共享多模态潜在空间中加强视觉和音频嵌入的对齐；(ii) 时间嵌入分组用于捕捉视觉和音频信号的相对时间对齐；(iii) 约束旋转时间嵌入用于在多模态嵌入中编码绝对时间信息。还引入了生成2400万单模态和多模态对话的数据管理流程。

Result: OmniVinci在DailyOmni（跨模态理解）上比Qwen2.5-Omni高出19.05分，在MMAR（音频）上高出1.7分，在Video-MME（视觉）上高出3.9分，而训练token仅使用0.2T，比Qwen2.5-Omni的1.2T减少了6倍。发现模态在感知和推理中相互增强。

Conclusion: 该模型在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中展示了多模态优势，证明了通过精心设计的架构和数据管理，可以在减少训练数据的同时实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉Transformer自编码器的无监督异常检测方法，用于脑肿瘤分割，无需人工标注即可通过重建误差图检测和定位肿瘤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑磁共振成像中标注数据有限、成本高或不一致的问题，提供可扩展的无监督分割方案。

Method: 使用多模态视觉Transformer自编码器，仅用健康脑MRI训练，通过多模态早期-晚期融合策略整合不同MRI序列信息，并利用Segment Anything Model进行后处理优化肿瘤轮廓。

Result: 在BraTS-GoAT 2025数据集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice相似系数分别为0.437、0.316和0.350，验证集异常检测率达89.4%。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型有潜力成为神经肿瘤影像学中可扩展、标签高效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医学统一多模态模型，能够在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，解决了现有医学AI系统将这两种能力分离的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI系统破坏了诊断过程的统一性：图像理解模型只能解释图像但不能生成视觉输出，而图像生成模型只能合成图像但不能提供文本解释，导致数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的差距。

Method: 采用观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式：观察层构建UniMed-5M数据集（560万样本）；知识层提出渐进式课程学习；分析层开发UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: UniMedVL在5个医学图像理解基准测试中表现优异，同时在8种医学成像模态的生成质量上与专用模型相当。双向知识共享表明生成任务能增强视觉理解特征。

Conclusion: 在单一医学框架中整合传统上分离的能力，能够在多样的医学视觉语言任务中实现全面改进，证明了统一架构的价值。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DGME-T方法，通过注入方向性网格运动编码来增强视频Transformer在档案影片分类中的性能，在现代化和历史影片上都取得了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有相机运动分类模型在处理档案影片时性能下降的问题，因为档案影片存在噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等挑战

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并基于Video Swin Transformer引入DGME-T方法，通过可学习的归一化后期融合层注入基于光流的方向性网格运动编码

Result: DGME-T将主干网络的top-1准确率从81.78%提升到86.14%，宏F1从82.08%提升到87.81%；在二战影片上准确率从83.43%提升到84.62%，宏F1从81.72%提升到82.63%

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验和Transformer表示是互补的，即使是一个小型精心校准的运动头也能显著增强在退化影片分析中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的视频编辑技术发展受到大规模高质量训练数据稀缺的严重制约，需要解决这一根本性挑战。

Method: 1) 融合领先图像编辑器和上下文视频生成器的数据生成管道；2) 采用高效蒸馏模型架构和时序增强器来平衡成本与质量；3) 使用智能代理生成多样化指令并严格筛选输出；4) 在Ditto-1M数据集上采用课程学习策略训练Editto模型。

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了基于指令的视频编辑中的数据稀缺问题，建立的Editto模型在该任务中达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

TL;DR: 提出SEGA方法，通过分层推理框架和从粗到细策略解决内容感知布局生成问题，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用单步推理框架，缺乏基于反馈的自校正机制，在面对复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加

Method: SEGA采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块粗略估计布局规划结果，精炼模块对粗规划结果进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的结果，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: SEGA通过分层推理和从粗到细策略有效解决了内容感知布局生成问题，显著提升了布局规划能力

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声驱动的检测和缓解方法，用于识别和减轻文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型容易生成不当内容，特别是面对隐含的性暗示提示时。现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，难以检测这些隐含线索，而微调方法会降低生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声驱动的检测和缓解框架：1) 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发基于噪声的检测方法；2) 提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制，通过抑制突出区域的注意力来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗性数据集上的实验验证表明，NDM在检测和缓解隐含恶意意图方面优于现有最先进方法（如SLD、UCE、RECE等）。

Conclusion: NDM框架能够有效检测和缓解文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型的原始生成能力，为解决模型偏见和伦理问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，使用粗糙标注训练分割模型具有实际意义，但边界对齐效果不佳。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，通过基于SLIC超像素的上采样正则化方法，鼓励分割结果与颜色和位置相关的超像素保持一致。

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，相比现有方法显著提高了边界召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了在粗糙标注下训练的分割模型的边界对齐性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频保真度不足和罕见激活尖峰问题，提升图像质量同时保持纹理细节。

Method: 结合每样本微钳制（限制极端值但不损失纹理）和自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip），AQClip可使用局部结构统计或注意力熵指导模式来调整允许值范围。

Result: 在SD/SDXL骨干网络上获得一致的定性改进，与CFG/Rescale有协同作用，可在不产生伪影的情况下使用更高的引导强度。

Conclusion: QSilk是一个有效的稳定解决方案，能显著提升潜在扩散模型的输出质量，特别是在低步数和高分辨率场景下。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型存在输入到概念映射偏差和有限可控性问题，限制了实际价值并损害了基于概念方法的责任策略。

Method: 引入滤波器分组损失和联合概念监督，自动将视觉特征分组为语义上有意义的组件，无需区域标注。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的实验表明，LDCBM实现了更高的概念和类别准确率，在可解释性和分类性能方面均优于先前CBMs。

Conclusion: 通过将概念基于视觉证据，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Conclusion: ReCon框架通过改进生成过程的空间语义对齐，有效解决了现有生成方法的问题，为数据增强提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个多代理系统，通过迭代循环自动改进视频生成质量，通过分解用户想法、选择最佳视频、专业代理评估和推理代理重写提示来实现持续优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频合成方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而现有的测试时优化方法难以处理视频的多方面特性。

Method: VISTA将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划，通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频，由视觉、音频和上下文保真度三个专业代理进行批评，推理代理综合反馈重写提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA持续提高视频质量和用户意图对齐度，相比最先进基线达到60%的成对胜率，人类评估者在66.4%的比较中偏好VISTA输出。

Conclusion: VISTA通过自主迭代改进机制，在视频生成质量和对齐用户意图方面表现优于现有方法，验证了多代理系统在视频生成优化中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RelateSeg方法，在开放词汇语义分割中引入神经符号空间推理，通过一阶逻辑约束解决传统视觉语言模型缺乏空间关系理解的问题，实现空间关系一致的像素级分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于视觉语言模型的开放词汇语义分割方法缺乏对场景中物体空间关系的理解，导致分割结果在空间关系上不一致。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，自动提取空间关系并编码为一阶逻辑公式，每个像素同时预测语义类别和空间伪类别，通过模糊逻辑松弛在深度网络中实现端到端学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到最先进的平均mIoU性能，特别是在包含多个类别的图像上表现优势，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有有效性，RelateSeg通过空间关系约束显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

TL;DR: 3DPR是一个基于图像的重新光照模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光源图像学习生成先验，能够从单张肖像图像生成高质量的重光照视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染将输入图像分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于底层模型的假设和近似。需要一种能更好处理高频面部反射的方法。

Method: 使用预训练的生成头部模型提供几何先验，通过编码器将输入图像嵌入到潜在空间。然后使用基于triplane的反射网络合成高质量OLAT图像，实现基于图像的重新光照。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别是在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如镜面反射、自阴影和次表面散射）方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法结合生成先验和光舞台数据，能够从单张输入图像生成物理准确的环境重光照结果，解决了单目肖像重光照的欠约束问题。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: Memory-SAM是一个无需训练、无需人工提示的舌像分割方法，通过检索历史案例自动生成有效提示来指导SAM2模型，在真实场景下显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型仍需人工提示。为了在中医舌诊分析中实现准确且无需人工干预的舌像分割，需要开发数据高效、无需训练的方法。

Method: 基于DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，从检索到的案例中提取掩码约束的对应关系，自动生成前景/背景点提示来指导SAM2模型，无需人工点击或模型微调。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，混合测试集的mIoU达到0.9863，显著优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框的SAM基线(0.1839)，在真实场景下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌像不规则边界分割，为中医舌诊分析提供了可靠的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Motivation: 推进原生图像生成的前沿，将文本到图像生成和图像编辑统一到单一架构中，解决图像编辑的挑战性问题。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成基于多模态输入的离散图像token，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在各种文本到图像和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 架构选择的关键在于可扩展性和快速推理能力；强化学习能推动原生图像生成前沿；数据质量和规模决定模型性能上限；混合架构结合了自回归模型的推理能力和扩散模型的细节渲染能力。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Motivation: 解决生物医学视觉语言模型在临床应用中因提示优化技术产生不可解释的潜在向量或单一文本提示而缺乏透明度的问题，这些限制影响了在高风险医疗环境中的可信度。

Method: 利用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，BiomedXPro为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信赖和临床对齐AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性检测器主要依赖单标签基准，无法充分捕捉真实世界毒性提示的模糊性和多维度特性，导致有偏见的评估，包括漏检和误报，削弱了现有检测器的可靠性。

Method: 从公共毒性数据集中提取并基于详细的15类别分类法进行标注，构建了三个多标签基准；提供了理论证明显示在发布的数据集上，使用伪标签训练比直接学习单标签监督表现更好；开发了基于伪标签的毒性检测方法。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，该方法显著超越了包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek在内的先进基线，能够对LLM生成内容中的多标签毒性进行更准确可靠的评估。

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准和伪标签方法有效解决了现有毒性检测的局限性，为LLM生成内容的多标签毒性评估提供了更准确可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI在自动作文评分系统中的应用日益增多，本研究旨在评估AI模型在处理成语等修辞语言时的表现，以了解其在教育评估中的潜在局限性和适用性。

Method: 从348篇学生作文中创建两个相等的列表：一个包含多个成语，另一个不含成语。使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Deepseek三个生成式AI模型，按照人类评分者使用的相同评分标准对两组作文进行三次评分。

Result: 所有模型都表现出极好的一致性，但Gemini在与人评分者的评分者间信度方面优于其他模型。AI评估未检测到对任何人口群体的偏见。对于含多个成语的作文，Gemini的评分模式最接近人类评分者。

Conclusion: 研究中的模型展示了混合方法的潜力，但Gemini由于其处理修辞语言的能力成为最佳选择，未来有望单独处理作文评分任务。

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常是静态的，持续学习面临灾难性遗忘问题。受参数共享导致遗忘的启发，研究稀疏参数更新是否能实现无灾难性遗忘的学习。

Method: 引入稀疏记忆微调，利用记忆层模型的设计特性，仅更新被新知识高度激活的记忆槽，减少新知识与模型现有能力之间的干扰。

Result: 在问答任务评估中，稀疏记忆微调在学习新知识的同时遗忘显著减少：NaturalQuestions F1仅下降11%，而全微调下降89%，LoRA下降71%。

Conclusion: 记忆层中的稀疏性为大语言模型的持续学习提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLAMA等基准测试使用的模板翻译没有考虑命名实体的语法和语义信息，导致最终提示存在语法错误或措辞不当，影响分数解释性，特别是在形态丰富的语言中

Method: 从MLAMA数据集中选取4种斯拉夫语言，比较初始模板翻译与Google Translate和ChatGPT整句翻译的知识检索分数差异，并对5种其他语系语言进行补充分析

Result: 观察到知识检索分数显著提高，整句翻译能更好地保持语法正确性

Conclusion: 建议社区控制多语言数据集的语法正确性，神经机器翻译或LLM系统的整句翻译是很好的近似方法

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:

### [95] [Latent Topic Synthesis: Leveraging LLMs for Electoral Ad Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15125)
*Alexander Brady,Tunazzina Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的框架，用于从未标注语料库自动生成可解释的主题分类法，结合无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，无需种子集或领域专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在塑造政治话语中发挥关键作用，但分析其庞大且快速演化的内容仍然是一个主要挑战。需要可扩展、可解释的方法来分析政治信息。

Method: 结合无监督聚类与基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建主题分类法，无需种子集或领域专业知识。应用于2024年美国总统选举前一个月的Meta政治广告语料库。

Result: 发现投票和移民广告在总支出和展示次数中占主导地位，而堕胎和选举诚信议题获得不成比例的关注度。资金模式同样两极分化：经济诉求主要由保守派PAC推动，堕胎信息在支持和反对权利联盟间分裂，犯罪与司法运动分散在地方委员会中。

Conclusion: 该框架支持社交媒体政治信息的可扩展、可解释分析，使研究人员、政策制定者和公众能够更好地理解新兴叙事、极化动态以及数字政治沟通的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

Motivation: 在波斯语等低资源语言中生成高质量多选题面临挑战，需要开发专门的方法来提升教育测试的效率和质量。

Method: 结合候选生成、过滤和排序技术，利用Transformer模型和知识图谱，集成基于规则的方法来生成可信的干扰项，基于维基百科数据构建波斯语MCQ数据集。

Result: 开发了包含10,289个问题的波斯语MCQ数据集，经多种最先进大语言模型评估，证明了模型有效性和数据集质量。

Conclusion: FarsiMCQGen方法在波斯语多选题生成方面表现出色，所创建的数据集具有高质量，有望推动多选题领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

TL;DR: 提出Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习将检索内容转换为结构化表示，优化多步推理过程，在7B规模模型上实现与更大模型相媲美的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统使用非结构化文本导致信息密度低、推理效果不佳，需要更高效的结构化知识表示来增强LLM的推理能力

Method: 使用强化学习学习内容表示策略，动态生成任务特定的结构化格式；引入自奖励结构验证机制确保生成结构的正确性和自包含性

Result: 在7个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模模型实现竞争性性能，匹配更大模型的表现

Conclusion: 结构化表示通过提高信息密度和上下文清晰度来增强推理能力，Structure-R1为知识密集型任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN和VLAT两种方法来解决大型音频语言模型的长音频上下文限制问题，Partial YaRN是一种无需训练、仅修改音频token位置的扩展方法，VLAT是一种训练策略，通过模拟不同音频长度来提升模型对长音频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型受限于短音频上下文窗口，即使其文本主干支持长上下文，这限制了长形式音频理解能力。现有上下文扩展方法主要针对单模态LLM，在LALMs中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 1. Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的上下文扩展方法，仅修改音频token位置，保持文本位置不变以保留基础LLM的文本能力；2. VLAT：将Partial YaRN扩展到训练时的位置增强策略，在训练中模拟不同音频长度。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Partial YaRN在多种设置下优于原始模型，VLAT训练策略提供了显著改进，在未见长度的长音频上实现了强大性能。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT方法有效解决了LALMs的长音频上下文限制问题，Partial YaRN作为无需训练的方法表现出色，VLAT进一步提升了模型对长音频的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了离散扩散语言模型与自回归语言模型的混合架构，通过文本空间和潜在空间的协作，实现了准确率提升和计算效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型虽然准确率高但需要长序列，计算成本高；离散扩散模型支持并行生成且有强大推理能力。研究旨在探索两者协作能否获得互补优势。

Method: 首先在文本空间协作：一个模型规划推理过程，另一个基于规划执行答案生成。然后在潜在空间协作：引入学习投影器将扩散模型潜在空间映射到自回归模型嵌入空间。

Result: 从文本空间转向潜在空间协作显著提升准确率：DART-5从27.0%提升到54.0%，AIME24从0.0%提升到14.0%。混合架构在保持准确率的同时大幅节省计算：仅用64个规划token和5个执行token，超越使用44倍token的Qwen3.1-7B。

Conclusion: 离散扩散模型在混合架构中具有巨大潜力，潜在空间协作能有效提升性能，同时提供显著的计算效率优势。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

Conclusion: 多模态RAG是文档AI的重要发展方向，但仍面临效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性等挑战，需要进一步研究来推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有ICD编码方法面临的临床文本与ICD代码之间的语义鸿沟、罕见和长尾代码性能差以及可解释性有限等问题。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合多源外部知识（UMLS、维基百科、LLMs），采用混合注意力机制建模标签、临床上下文和知识之间的交互。

Result: 在MIMIC-III-ICD9、MIMIC-IV-ICD9和MIMIC-IV-ICD10数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动化ICD编码提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，满足临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TACL（阈值自适应课程学习）框架，通过动态调整训练过程来处理医学文本的复杂性差异，在多种临床任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学文本（特别是电子病历）具有非结构化、领域特定语言和上下文变异性等特点，现有方法将所有数据视为同等难度，忽略了复杂性的内在差异，限制了模型在罕见或复杂病例上的泛化能力。

Method: TACL框架基于渐进学习原则，根据样本复杂度动态调整训练过程，将数据分类为不同难度级别，在训练早期优先处理简单病例以建立坚实基础，然后再处理复杂记录。

Result: 在包括英语和中文临床记录的多语言医学数据上应用TACL，在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医证候鉴别等多种临床任务中观察到显著改进。

Conclusion: TACL不仅提升了自动化系统的性能，还展示了统一不同医学领域方法的潜力，为更准确、可扩展和全球适用的医学文本理解解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

Motivation: 解决LLM在知识图谱问答中存在的语义鸿沟问题，以及训练无关方法未能充分利用训练数据中有价值推理模式的问题。

Method: EGP框架：1) 通过实体模板化预处理训练集问题；2) 使用语义嵌入和FAISS索引检索相似示例；3) 在任务分解和关系探索两个阶段动态指导LLM规划；4) 引入智能前瞻机制提高效率。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个真实世界KGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoG-EGP显著优于基线PoG系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP框架通过示例引导规划有效提升了LLM在知识图谱问答中的性能，证明了利用训练数据中成功推理模式的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

Conclusion: CoordGen通过推测解码与动态硬件调度的集成，有效解决了移动设备上LLM推理的内存限制问题，为上下文感知文本生成提供了高效的移动推理解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

Motivation: 大语言模型在创意领域的应用日益增多，但它们在古典诗歌生成和评估方面的表现仍不清楚，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 采用三步评估框架：计算指标、LLM作为评判者评估、人类专家验证，评估了六个最先进的LLM在诗歌质量多个维度上的表现。

Result: 分析揭示了系统性的生成和评估偏见：LLM在评估创意质量时表现出"回音室"效应，常常趋同于与人类判断不同的有缺陷标准。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为文学生成代理的能力既有潜力也有局限性，在文化和技术上复杂的创意任务中，仍然需要人类和模型的混合验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

TL;DR: AutoGraph-R1是首个使用强化学习直接优化知识图谱构建以提升任务性能的框架，通过将图生成作为策略学习问题，基于图在RAG管道中的功能效用设计奖励函数，显著提升了问答系统的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前知识图谱构建过程与下游应用脱节，导致图结构不理想，限制了检索增强生成在问答系统中的有效性。

Method: 提出AutoGraph-R1框架，使用强化学习训练LLM构造器，将图生成视为策略学习问题，设计了两种任务感知的奖励函数——作为知识载体的图和作为知识索引的图。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，AutoGraph-R1使图RAG方法相比任务无关的基线图谱实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作表明可以在构建和应用之间形成闭环，将范式从构建本质上"好"的图转变为构建可证明"有用"的图。

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

TL;DR: 该研究发现传统可读性评估指标与人类感知存在不匹配，模型化方法在预测人类可读性判断方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动可读性评估领域存在定义不一致和依赖表层文本特征的问题，需要更准确地反映人类对可读性的感知。

Method: 分析了897个人类可读性判断，评估了15个传统可读性指标和6个基于模型的指标在5个英文数据集上的表现。

Result: 4个基于模型的指标在人类判断相关性排名中始终位列前四，而最佳传统指标平均排名仅为8.6。

Conclusion: 基于模型的方法是可读性评估更有前景的方向，信息内容和主题对文本可理解性有重要影响。

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

TL;DR: SAFE是一个用于大语言模型长文本生成的集成框架，通过选择性集成和概率锐化策略，在仅集成不到1%的token的情况下实现更好的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成方法在长文本生成中效果不佳，因为每个token都集成会导致性能下降，需要找到合适的集成位置。

Method: 提出SAFE框架，基于tokenization不匹配和概率分布共识两个因素选择性集成，并引入概率锐化策略来合并表示同一单词的多个子词token的概率。

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法，即使集成少于1%的token也能获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 选择性集成策略对于长文本生成中的模型集成至关重要，SAFE框架通过考虑tokenization和概率共识实现了稳定高效的集成效果。

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

TL;DR: 提出了LayoutRL强化学习框架和Infinity-Parser模型，在文档解析任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著优于专业文档解析系统和通用视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扫描图像文档解析的挑战，现有监督微调方法难以泛化到不同文档类型，特别是在分布外数据上表现不佳，且高质量训练数据有限。

Method: 引入LayoutRL强化学习框架，通过整合归一化编辑距离、段落计数准确性和阅读顺序保持的复合奖励来优化布局理解；构建Infinity-Doc-400K数据集训练Infinity-Parser视觉语言模型。

Result: 在OmniDocBench、olmOCR-Bench、PubTabNet和FinTabNet等基准测试中，Infinity-Parser在各种文档类型、语言和结构复杂性上始终实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LayoutRL框架和Infinity-Parser模型在文档解析任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，将发布代码、数据集和模型以促进可复现研究。

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

TL;DR: Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅（特别是帕金森病相关）场景下表现严重下降，现有评估方法过于理想化，缺乏系统性测试框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speech-LLMs评估主要基于理想输入，忽略了常见语音不流畅问题，特别是与帕金森病等疾病相关的语音障碍，需要测试这些模型在实际应用中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了VocalBench-DF框架，用于系统性评估语音不流畅的多维度分类，并对22个主流Speech-LLMs进行了评估。

Result: 评估显示Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下性能显著下降，识别出音素级处理和长上下文建模是主要瓶颈，通过加强组件和流程的识别与推理能力可显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前Speech-LLMs在实际应用准备度有限，迫切需要新方法来改进语音不流畅处理，构建真正包容的语音大语言模型。

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

TL;DR: 为了解决游戏推荐和广告中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，提出了用户游戏生命周期(UGL)来丰富用户行为，并采用逆概率掩码策略进行表示学习，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统方法不适合游戏广告和推荐，主要因为游戏稀疏性(仅数百款游戏)和游戏不平衡性(用户行为被少数热门游戏主导)。

Method: 引入用户游戏生命周期(UGL)丰富用户行为，提出两种创新策略提取用户短期和长期兴趣，使用逆概率掩码策略处理游戏不平衡问题。

Result: 离线实验平均AUC提升1.83%，在线实验游戏广告CVR平均提升21.67%，游戏内物品推荐ARPU平均提升0.82%。

Conclusion: UGL表示学习能有效解决游戏推荐和广告中的稀疏性和不平衡问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个专门化MedGemma模型的框架，用于生成高保真度的医学图像描述，以改进检索增强生成系统在图像查询中的表现。通过知识蒸馏创建合成数据集，并使用QLoRA方法微调模型，显著提升了分类性能和描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成系统在处理基于图像的医学查询时效果有限的问题，因为通用视觉语言模型生成的描述缺乏临床特异性和事实基础。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏管道创建皮肤病学、眼底和胸部放射学领域的合成数据集，使用参数高效的QLoRA方法微调MedGemma模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在分类性能上取得显著提升，RAGAS评估显示描述忠实度、相关性和正确性均有显著改善。

Conclusion: 建立了一个专门化医学视觉语言模型的稳健流程，验证了该模型作为高质量查询生成器的能力，为增强多模态RAG系统在循证临床决策支持中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GuessBench基准来评估多模态大语言模型在信息不完整情况下的主动推理能力，发现现有模型在主动推理方面表现远低于被动推理，并识别了细粒度感知和及时决策作为关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM评估主要关注被动推理，而现实世界应用往往需要模型在信息不完整时主动获取证据，这种能力与真实使用场景存在差距。

Method: 构建GuessBench基准，包含感知导向和知识导向图像，要求模型从候选池中选择目标图像来主动获取缺失证据，并在信息不完整情况下迭代优化决策。

Result: 评估20个优秀MLLM发现，主动推理性能远低于被动设置，细粒度感知和及时决策是主要挑战。消融研究表明感知增强对小模型有益，而思维导向方法对所有模型都有提升。

Conclusion: 多模态主动推理仍有很大改进空间，感知增强和思维导向方法是未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出基于提示工程的可控摘要生成方法，通过多阶段提示框架实现不同抽象程度的摘要，实验发现提示长度、数据噪声和文本类型对摘要质量有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在摘要质量和可控性方面的问题，探索如何通过提示工程提升大语言模型的摘要生成能力。

Method: 设计多阶段提示生成框架，包括语义分析、主题建模和噪声控制，使用CNN/Daily Mail数据集进行实验分析。

Result: 提示长度对摘要质量影响显著，过长或过短都会降低质量；数据噪声增加会降低ROUGE-L分数；模型在新闻文本上表现最佳，学术文章表现较差。

Conclusion: 通过控制提示策略和优化文本预处理，可以有效提高大语言模型生成摘要的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

*Gucongcong Fan,Chaoyue Niu,Chengfei Lyu,Fan Wu,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE是一个协作框架，结合云端和本地LLM的优势，在保持移动代理任务准确性的同时减少UI暴露。通过布局感知块分区、协同规划和协同决策，将UI暴露减少高达55.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM需要上传完整UI状态，暴露不必要且通常无关的信息，存在隐私风险；本地LLM避免UI上传但能力有限，任务成功率较低。需要平衡隐私保护和任务准确性。

Method: 1) 基于XML屏幕层次结构的布局感知块分区，将语义相关的UI元素分组；2) 本地和云端LLM协同识别当前子任务的协同规划；3) 本地LLM对相关UI块排序，云端LLM在排名最高的块中选择特定UI元素的协同决策。

Result: 实验表明，CORE将UI暴露减少高达55.6%，同时任务成功率略低于纯云端代理，有效减轻了不必要的云端隐私暴露。

Conclusion: CORE框架成功平衡了隐私保护和任务准确性，通过云端和本地LLM的协作机制，在显著减少UI暴露的同时保持了较高的任务成功率。

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,
which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen
hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs
collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)
$\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks,
and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.
CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local
misjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and
tasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task
success rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating
unnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud. The code is available at
https://github.com/Entropy-Fighter/CORE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeceptionBench是首个系统评估大型语言模型在不同社会领域中欺骗行为的基准测试，涵盖经济、医疗、教育、社交和娱乐五个领域，包含150个场景和1000多个样本，揭示了模型在激励和胁迫下欺骗行为加剧的严重漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的快速提升，出现了新兴的欺骗行为，这些行为在高风险部署中可能带来严重风险。当前对现实场景中欺骗行为的特征描述仍不足，需要建立系统评估基准。

Method: 建立DeceptionBench基准，包含五个社会领域的150个场景和1000多个样本。从内在维度评估模型的自利或谄媚倾向，从外在维度分析中性条件、奖励激励和胁迫压力下欺骗输出的变化，并纳入持续多轮交互来模拟真实反馈动态。

Result: 跨LLM和LRM的广泛实验揭示了关键漏洞，特别是在强化动态下欺骗行为会加剧，表明当前模型缺乏对操纵性上下文线索的稳健抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 当前模型对各种欺骗行为缺乏有效的安全防护，迫切需要开发先进的保护机制来应对这些风险。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available
at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各领域的广泛应用，特别是在时间敏感领域如法律、医疗和金融中，LLMs不仅需要事实准确性，还需要在时间维度上保持一致性，但目前缺乏针对时间参考一致性的评估和改进工作。

Method: 提出了TEMP-ReCon基准测试，涵盖多种语言环境（英语、法语、罗马尼亚语）来评估开源和闭源LLMs的时间参考一致性，并开发了基于推理路径对齐的UnTRaP模型来增强LLMs的时间一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前LLMs在时间参考一致性方面表现不足，而提出的UnTRaP模型相比多个基线模型在提升时间一致性方面表现出更好的效果。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间参考一致性方面存在不足，需要专门的评估和改进方法，UnTRaP模型为提升LLMs的时间一致性提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在表示罕见词时的低效问题，以及字符级模型在Transformer架构中的性能瓶颈，同时避免现有分层模型对空格或辅助模型的依赖。

Method: 在BPE分词基础上添加显式补丁结束标记，引入二级BPE压缩阶段来控制补丁粒度，无需额外模型。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在保持紧凑词汇表的同时，性能达到或超过基于动态熵和空格的补丁策略。

Conclusion: 提出的动态字符分组方法提供了高效、灵活且语言无关的表示方案，成功融合了子词和字符级模型的优势。

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent-SFT是一种两阶段学习框架，通过在词汇表概率的叠加空间中进行潜在推理，显著减少计算开销，同时保持与显式推理相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用思维链提示时推理能力强，但显式推理带来大量计算开销。现有的潜在推理方法虽然降低了成本，但性能显著下降，主要原因是非结构化的潜在空间难以拟合潜在标记。

Method: 提出Latent-SFT两阶段框架：第一阶段设计专门的注意力掩码指导潜在标记编码器生成潜在标记；第二阶段丢弃编码器，直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记进行推理，使用KL和CE损失优化。

Result: 在GSM8k上达到新的SOTA，匹配显式SFT性能同时将推理链缩短4倍，优于现有潜在方法。在Math500和AIME24上，基于词汇概率的潜在推理明显优于基于隐藏状态的方法。

Conclusion: 潜在推理既是单一路径的压缩，也是多路径的叠加，通过限制潜在空间到词汇表列空间，实现了高效且有效的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

Motivation: 尽管基于统一编码器的多模态大语言模型具有灵活性，但传统的对比学习训练容易导致模型学习模态捷径，在分布偏移下表现不佳。

Method: 使用偏好损失强制多模态嵌入优于单模态对应物，并通过组合正则化目标将多模态嵌入与其单模态部分组成的原型对齐，显式建模组合表示与单模态对应物之间的结构关系。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，该方法在分布外检索任务上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是使用MLLMs作为统一编码器时实现鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TokenTiming算法，通过动态时间规整技术实现通用推测解码，解决了传统推测解码需要草稿模型和目标模型共享词汇表的限制，实现了1.57倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法要求草稿模型和目标模型必须共享相同词汇表，这限制了可用草稿模型的选择范围，往往需要从头训练新模型，限制了该方法的应用。

Method: 基于动态时间规整算法，通过重新编码草稿标记序列获得新的目标标记序列，然后使用DTW建立映射来传输概率分布进行推测采样。

Result: 在各种任务上的综合实验表明实现了1.57倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了通用推测解码，使草稿模型选择更加灵活，让推测解码成为更通用实用的LLM加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

*Vihari Piratla,Purvam Jain,Darshan Singh,Partha Talukdar,Trevor Cohn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过偏差-方差分解的形式化分析，提出跨语言差距主要由目标语言响应方差引起，并通过实验验证了通过控制方差来减少跨语言差距的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于源语言和目标语言潜在表征的差异，但本文提出不同观点，认为目标语言响应方差是主要原因。

Method: 采用偏差-方差分解形式化跨语言差距，通过多种推理时干预措施控制响应方差，包括简单的提示指令。

Result: 实验显示通过控制响应方差，目标语言准确率在不同模型中提高了20-25%。

Conclusion: 目标语言响应方差是跨语言差距的主要成因，通过控制方差可以有效减少这一差距。

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

*Jinliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ParallaxRAG框架，通过多视图空间对称解耦查询和图三元组，构建稳健的检索架构，在约束弱相关路径的同时显式增强头多样性，实现基于知识图谱的多跳推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言理解方面表现出色，但经常产生幻觉且难以进行多跳推理。基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法提供了基础，但现有方法大多依赖扁平嵌入和噪声路径探索。

Method: 将查询和图三元组对称解耦到多视图空间，利用不同注意力头在不同推理阶段专门处理语义关系的特点，构建更清晰的子图并引导LLM进行基于知识的逐步推理。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上的实验表明，在统一的、可复现的设置下（BGE-M3 + Llama3.1-8B），实现了有竞争力的检索和问答性能，同时减少了幻觉并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视图头专业化是基于知识的多跳推理的一个原则性方向，实验结果验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了KITE基准，专门评估韩语大语言模型的指令跟随能力，填补了韩语开放指令评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主要关注英语模型，忽略了其他语言的独特特征。韩语具有独特的语法、形态特征、敬语系统和双数系统，缺乏专门的开放指令评估基准。

Method: 开发了KITE基准，包含通用和韩语特定指令，结合自动指标和人工评估构建评估流程。

Result: 揭示了不同模型间的性能差异，深入分析了模型的优势和弱点。

Conclusion: 通过公开KITE数据集和代码，旨在促进文化和语言包容性LLM开发，并激励对其他代表性不足语言的类似研究。

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation
for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

TL;DR: 提出跨语言双向最大相似度评分(BiMax)用于文档对齐，相比最优传输方法提高约100倍速度，同时保持相近的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档对齐方法在准确性和速度之间需要平衡，特别是在大规模网络挖掘数据场景下。

Method: 使用跨语言双向最大相似度评分计算文档间相似度，替代最优传输方法。

Result: 在WMT16双语文档对齐任务中，BiMax达到与最优传输方法相当的准确率，速度提升约100倍。

Conclusion: BiMax方法在保持高准确率的同时显著提升效率，为大规模文档对齐提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA
(https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA).

Method: 引入包含三本完整法语小说的新标注语料库（超过285,000个词符），并提出了模块化共指消解流程，支持细粒度错误分析。

Result: 该方法具有竞争力，能有效扩展到长文档，并可用于推断虚构人物的性别，对文学分析和下游NLP任务具有相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了长文档共指消解数据集的空白，提出的方法在长文档处理上表现良好，并为文学分析和NLP应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: While coreference resolution is attracting more interest than ever from
computational literature researchers, representative datasets of fully
annotated long documents remain surprisingly scarce. In this paper, we
introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained
error analysis. We show that our approach is competitive and scales effectively
to long documents. Finally, we demonstrate its usefulness to infer the gender
of fictional characters, showcasing its relevance for both literary analysis
and downstream NLP tasks.

TL;DR: HypoSpace是一个评估语言模型生成多种合理解释能力的诊断套件，通过有效性、独特性和覆盖率三个指标来衡量模型在不确定科学问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在科学工作流中的广泛应用，需要评估其提出多种解释而不仅仅是单一正确答案的能力，因为许多科学问题存在多种机制不同的合理解释。

Method: 将LLMs视为有限假设集的采样器，在三个结构化领域（因果图、3D体素重建、布尔遗传交互）中实例化HypoSpace，使用确定性验证器和精确枚举的假设空间。

Result: 在指令调优和推理导向模型中，有效性通常保持较高，但随着可接受空间的增长，独特性和覆盖率会下降，揭示了仅靠正确性指标无法发现的模式崩溃问题。

Conclusion: HypoSpace为显式探索和覆盖可接受解释空间的方法提供了一个受控探针，而不是简单的排行榜。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

Motivation: 利用大型语言模型作为动态知识库，为仇恨言论检测生成背景上下文，以提升检测性能，特别是在处理隐式仇恨言论和多模态内容时。

Method: 采用两种上下文生成策略（命名实体聚焦和全文提示）和四种上下文整合方法（文本拼接、嵌入拼接、分层transformer融合、LLM驱动文本增强），在文本和多模态数据集上进行实验。

Result: 在文本Latent Hatred数据集上获得最高3个F1分数提升，在多模态MAMI数据集上获得最高6个F1分数提升，基于嵌入拼接的方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文信息和整合方法对仇恨言论检测性能至关重要，基于嵌入拼接的方法在文本和多模态设置中均表现最佳。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Conclusion: 这是首个将互评估、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证相结合来评估LLM能力的工作，为LLM评估提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

Result: 在数据稀缺的人类语言和构造语言实验中，该方法与基于参考翻译的标准评估方法高度相关，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 在翻译学习的早期阶段，互动可能不是必要且效率不高，仅通过输出评估翻译器是可行的。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

Result: 模型呈现出两阶段学习动态：先快速记忆个体事实关联，然后在更长时间尺度上学习线性分离真假陈述，从而降低语言建模损失。在预训练语言模型中也验证了这一模式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了线性真值表示在语言模型中涌现的机制性证明和实证动机，展示了通过数据分布模式自然形成真值编码的具体路径。

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear
subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind
their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

Motivation: 当前学术项目网站在有效传播研究成果方面存在不足，现有方法（如直接LLM生成、模板或HTML转换）难以生成布局感知的交互式网站，且缺乏全面的评估套件。

Method: 提出Paper2Web基准数据集和多维评估框架，包含连通性、完整性等规则指标和人类验证的LLM评估。开发PWAgent自主管道，通过MCP工具迭代优化内容和布局。

Result: PWAgent在实验中显著优于基于模板的网页和arXiv/alphaXiv版本等端到端基线方法，同时保持低成本，在学术网页生成方面达到帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Paper2Web为学术网页生成提供了全面的评估基准，PWAgent证明了通过迭代优化内容和布局可以生成高质量的交互式学术主页。

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合词典、模糊逻辑和Transformer的混合框架，用于生成连续的情感极性强度分数，在多个领域数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于非正式和领域特定语言的存在，准确检测产品评论和社交媒体帖子中的情感极性和强度仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用VADER进行初始情感估计，通过DistilBERT的置信度分数进行两阶段调整，应用模糊逻辑减少中立性偏差，最终通过自定义模糊推理系统生成0-1连续分数。

Result: 在四个领域特定数据集（外卖、电商、旅游、时尚）上评估，结果显示与用户评分对齐度提高，能更好识别情感极端值，减少误分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了将符号推理与神经模型相结合在语言动态领域中进行可解释的细粒度情感分析的价值。

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Conclusion: 为利用这些新兴模型提供了经验指导和见解。

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ORBIT框架通过基于量规的增量强化学习，在开放式高风险医疗对话任务中显著提升LLM性能，在HealthBench-Hard基准上从7.0提升至27.2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在数学和代码等有明确奖励函数的领域表现良好，但在开放式领域（如医疗咨询）中缺乏稳健的奖励函数，限制了LLM在这些关键领域的应用。

Method: 提出ORBIT框架，结合合成对话生成和动态量规创建，使用量规指导的反馈进行增量强化学习，无需外部医学知识或手动规则。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型上，仅使用2k样本就将HealthBench-Hard基准性能从7.0提升至27.2，达到该规模模型的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 量规驱动的强化学习为复杂开放式任务中的LLM提供了一种可扩展的改进策略，超越了简单的数值提升，在各种咨询场景中实现一致性能增益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法学习的技能往往过度专门化于单一网站，缺乏泛化能力，无法在不同环境中有效重用。

Method: 受软件工程中多态性启发，将技能的抽象目标（做什么）与具体实现（怎么做）解耦，使智能体能够学习通用技能。

Result: 在已见网站上技能重用率提高1.7倍，在Mind2Web上成功率提升9.4%，在未见网站上成功率提升13.9%，同时减少20%以上的步骤。

Conclusion: 将技能目标与执行分离是开发能够在开放网络中持续学习和泛化的自主智能体的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出了Sobolev稳定间断Galerkin (SSDG) 方法，作为能量稳定通量重构 (ESFR) 方法的新保守线性稳定推广，并通过滤波间断Galerkin (FDG) 框架进行分析比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESFR方法提供了高阶线性稳定方案框架，但需要通过FDG框架进一步扩展和推广，以增强其灵活性和性能。

Method: 引入SSDG方案作为ESFR的保守线性稳定推广，通过FDG框架分析，并与现有EESFR方法进行Von Neumann分析比较。

Result: SSDG和EESFR方案在色散和耗散行为上存在根本差异，但都能提高CFL限制和达到相似的谱精度阶数。SSDG方案在增加显式时间步长限制的参数范围更大。

Conclusion: SSDG方案提供了比EESFR更广泛的参数选择范围来增加时间步长限制，但EESFR在h细化下的精度阶数通常为p+1，而SSDG为p。

Abstract: The energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) method encompasses an infinite
family of high-order, linearly stable schemes and thus provides a flex- ible
and efficient framework for achieving high levels of accuracy on unstruc- tured
grids. One remarkable property of ESFR schemes is their ability to be expressed
equivalently as linearly filtered discontinuous Galerkin (FDG) schemes. In this
study, we introduce Sobolev Stable discontinuous Galerkin (SSDG) schemes, a new
conservative and linearly stable generalization of ESFR schemes via the FDG
framework. Additionally, we review existing generalizations of the ESFR method
and consider their relationship with the FDG framework. The linear properties
of SSDG schemes are studied via Von Neumann analysis and compared to those of
the existing extended ESFR (EESFR) method. It is found that while SSDG and
EESFR schemes exhibit fundamentally different dispersive and dissipative
behaviors, they can achieve a similar increase in CFL limit and exhibit a
similar spectral order of accuracy. Moreover, it is seen that the range of
scheme parameters over which SSDG schemes can be used to increase the explicit
time-stepping limit is much larger than for EESFR schemes. Finally, it is
observed that the order of accuracy of EESFR schemes under h-refinement is
generally p + 1 while that of SSDG schemes is p.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分子动力学模拟的数据驱动碰撞算子，用于扩展单组分等离子体碰撞动力学模型到强耦合区域，具有各向异性、非平稳碰撞核，并通过快速谱分离方法实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Landau模型在弱耦合区域有效，但在中等耦合区域无法准确描述粒子相关性，需要开发能超越经典Landau公式的碰撞模型。

Method: 从分子动力学模拟中学习数据驱动的碰撞算子，采用各向异性非平稳碰撞核，开发快速谱分离方法将核表示为低秩张量积，使用快速傅里叶变换实现O(N log N)算法，并通过结构保持中心差分离散化保持物理性质。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提模型在中等耦合区域能准确捕捉等离子体动力学，超越标准Landau模型，同时保持高计算效率和结构保持特性。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动碰撞算子成功扩展了等离子体碰撞模型的应用范围，在保持计算效率的同时准确描述了中等耦合区域的物理特性。

Abstract: We present a generalized, data-driven collisional operator for one-component
plasmas, learned from molecular dynamics simulations, to extend the collisional
kinetic model beyond the weakly coupled regime. The proposed operator features
an anisotropic, non-stationary collision kernel that accounts for particle
correlations typically neglected in classical Landau formulations. To enable
efficient numerical evaluation, we develop a fast spectral separation method
that represents the kernel as a low-rank tensor product of univariate basis
functions. This formulation admits an $O(N \log N)$ algorithm via fast Fourier
transforms and preserves key physical properties, including discrete
conservation laws and the H-theorem, through a structure-preserving central
difference discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model accurately captures plasma dynamics in the moderately coupled regime
beyond the standard Landau model while maintaining high computational
efficiency and structure-preserving properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMAC公式在弱不可压缩条件下仍能保持能量、线性动量和角动量守恒，相比流行的斜对称格式在直接数值模拟和正则化Navier-Stokes方程模型中具有优势。结合LM模型可解决经典Smagorinsky模型的过度耗散问题。

Method: 开发了EMAC-LM系统的有限元离散化方法，分析了其稳定性并推导了数值误差估计。

Result: EMAC-LM模型相比标准LM方法具有改进的长时间行为，特别是在高雷诺数下能产生更准确的流动结构。EMAC的Gronwall常数与雷诺数无关，这是其优势所在。

Conclusion: EMAC与LM的结合有效解决了经典Smagorinsky模型的过度耗散问题，在高雷诺数流动模拟中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate the EMAC formulation into the Ladyzhenskaya
model (LM), a large eddy simulation (LES) of incompressible flows. The EMAC
formulation, which conserves energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum even
with weak enforcement of incompressibility, has been shown to provide tangible
benefits over the popular skew-symmetric for direct numerical simulation and
regularized models of the Navier Stokes equations (NSE). The combination of
EMAC with the LM addresses the known over-dissipation issues associated with
the classical Smagorinsky model (SM). We develop a finite element
discretization for the EMAC-LM system and analyze its stability and derive
numerical error estimates, showing improved long-time behavior compared to the
standard LM approach, particularly due to EMAC's favorable Gronwall constant
independent of the Reynolds number. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that the
EMAC-LM model yields more accurate flow structures, especially at high Reynolds
numbers.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Anderson型加速方法在数值优化中的应用，该方法通过最小化残差总和和使用历史解作为降阶模型来加速固定点迭代的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数数学建模问题可以表述为约束优化问题，其必要最优性条件可写为Banach空间中的固定点问题。Anderson加速方法旨在改进标准固定点迭代的收敛速度。

Method: 使用Anderson加速方法，通过最小化残差总和并利用历史解序列的最优线性组合来更新解。结合降阶模型方法和变步长梯度/拟牛顿方法生成解基，然后用ROM加速。

Result: 当矩阵A的条件数不大时，该方法收敛非常迅速。带ROM加速的变迭代方法接近最优，且ROM还能正则化和稳定收敛过程。

Conclusion: Anderson加速方法结合降阶模型技术能有效加速数值优化问题的收敛，特别适用于大规模病态线性系统的求解。

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the Anderson's type acceleration method for
numerical optimizations. Most mathematical modeling problems can be formulated
as constrained optimization. The necessary optimality condition is written as a
fixed point problem in a Banach space. Anderson's acceleration method improves
the convergence of the standard fixed point iteration by minimizing the total
sum of residuals and updating solutions through an optimal linear combination
of a sequence of iterates. Thus, it is a form of iterative method of retard
which uses the history of solutions as a reduced order element method (ROM).
The weights are determined optimally by the least squares problem based on the
total residual. We analyze Anderson's method and the reduced order method (ROM)
for nonlinear least squares problems of minimizing |F(x)| squared. That is, the
solution is approximated by a linear combination of sequentially generated
solutions, and then we minimize the equation error on the linear manifold
spanned by the iterates. We use the reduced order Gauss Newton method to solve
the least squares problem for |F(x)| squared on the linear solution manifold.
For the linear equation case it is similar to Anderson's method. Anderson's
method approximates the solution to the nonlinear ROM. We consider variable
step size gradient and quasi Newton methods and the variable fixed point
iteration to generate the solution basis, then combine these with ROM
acceleration. It converges very rapidly if the condition number of matrix A is
not large. The variable iterate with ROM acceleration is nearly optimal, and
ROM also regularizes and stabilizes the convergence. We also consider a
randomly overlapped Kaczmarz type method and develop an acceleration approach
for large scale ill posed linear systems. Finally, we analyze the convergence
of the ROM to the operator equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非线性紧致差分方法计算成本高，需要开发更高效的数值方案来解决二维粘性Burgers方程，同时保持高精度。

Method: 采用时空双网格策略：粗网格阶段使用定点迭代处理非线性系统，细网格阶段通过线性时间插值和三次空间拉格朗日插值构造初始近似，最后通过线性化校正方案进行精化。

Result: 理论分析证明方法无条件收敛，具有时间二阶精度和空间四阶精度。数值实验显示ST-TGCD方案相比传统非线性紧致差分方法减少CPU时间70%以上，同时保持相当精度。

Conclusion: ST-TGCD方案是传统非线性方法的高效替代方案，在计算效率和精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient space-time two-grid compact difference
(ST-TGCD) scheme for solving the two-dimensional (2D) viscous Burgers' equation
subject to initial and periodic boundary conditions. The proposed approach
combines a compact finite difference discretization with a two-grid strategy to
achieve high computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In the
coarse-grid stage, a fixed-point iteration is employed to handle the nonlinear
system, while in the fine-grid stage, linear temporal and cubic spatial
Lagrange interpolations are used to construct initial approximations. The final
fine-grid solution is refined through a carefully designed linearized
correction scheme. Rigorous analysis establishes unconditional convergence of
the method, demonstrating second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order
accuracy in space. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical results and
show that the ST-TGCD scheme reduces CPU time by more than 70\% compared with
the traditional nonlinear compact difference (NCD) method, while maintaining
comparable accuracy. These findings confirm the proposed scheme as a highly
efficient alternative to conventional nonlinear approaches.

Motivation: 传统方法求解非线性PDEs时面临非线性项处理困难、收敛性差和计算效率低的问题，需要开发更高效稳定的数值方法。

Method: 采用Fenchel-Rockafellar对偶解耦非线性项，使用间断有限元离散，应用变换原始-对偶动力学处理非线性鞍点系统，设计高效预处理器和多重网格求解器。

Result: 在椭圆p-Laplacian和非线性H(curl)问题上进行了广泛数值实验，显示出显著的效率提升和全局、网格无关的收敛性。

Conclusion: DualTPD方法通过解耦、变换动力学和高效预处理器，为非线性PDEs提供了高效稳定的数值求解方案。

Abstract: A DualTPD method is proposed for solving nonlinear partial differential
equations. The method is characterized by three main features. First,
decoupling via Fenchel--Rockafellar duality is achieved, so that nonlinear
terms are discretized by discontinuous finite element spaces, yielding
block-diagonal mass matrices and closed-form updates. Second, improved
convergence is obtained by applying transformed primal--dual (TPD) dynamics to
the nonlinear saddle-point system, which yields strongly monotone behavior.
Third, efficient preconditioners are designed for the elliptic-type Schur
complement arising from the separated differential operators, and multigrid
solvers are applied effectively. Extensive numerical experiments on elliptic
$p$-Laplacian and nonlinear $H(\curl)$ problems are presented, showing
significant efficiency gains with global, mesh-independent convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的显式稳定方法在处理局部空间网格细化时效率下降，因为刚度由最小的网格元素驱动。需要将系统分解为快速刚性和较慢的轻度刚性分量来提高效率。

Method: 扩展了[A. Abdulle, M.J. Grote and G. Rosilho de Souza 2022]的一阶多速率显式稳定方法(mRKC)，提出了二阶多速率ROCK2方法(mROCK2)，并引入了具有误差控制的步长策略。

Conclusion: mROCK2方法实现了高精度，并允许进行误差控制的步长策略，在具有局部空间网格细化的刚性系统中表现出良好的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Explicit stabilized methods are highly efficient time integrators for large
and stiff systems of ordinary differential equations especially when applied to
semi-discrete parabolic problems. However, when local spatial mesh refinement
is introduced, their efficiency decreases, since the stiffness is driven by
only the smallest mesh element. A natural approach is to split the system into
fast stiff and slower mildly stiff components. In this context, [A. Abdulle,
M.J. Grote and G. Rosilho de Souza 2022] proposed the order one multirate
explicit stabilized method (mRKC). We extend their approach to second order and
introduce the new multirate ROCK2 method (mROCK2), which achieves high
precision and allows a step-size strategy with error control. Numerical methods
including the heat equation with local spatial mesh refinements confirm the
accuracy and efficiency of the scheme.

the existence of a unique discrete solution to the nonlocal nonlinear discrete
problem. We derive an optimal-order error estimate in the discrete energy norm.
The discrete system is solved using Newton's iterations on the sparse matrix
system. We perform numerical tests to substantiate the theoretical results.

*Elisabetta Carlini,Luca Saluzzi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出一种结合半拉格朗日时间离散化和张量分解的完全离散方案，用于求解高维平均场博弈系统，有效缓解维度灾难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维平均场博弈系统时面临维度灾难，存储和计算成本随维度指数增长，需要开发高效数值方法。

Method: 将Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman和Fokker-Planck方程重构为一系列平流-扩散-反应子问题，采用半拉格朗日时间离散化和张量分解格式，结合适当求积规则。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法达到理论收敛阶，内存使用和运行时间随维度增长缓慢，在单位CPU时间内的精度显著优于基于网格的半拉格朗日方法。

Conclusion: 张量分解加速的半拉格朗日方法能够有效求解高维平均场博弈系统，将存储和计算成本从指数级降低到多项式级。

Abstract: We introduce a fully discrete scheme to solve a class of high-dimensional
Mean Field Games systems. Our approach couples semi-Lagrangian (SL) time
discretizations with Tensor-Train (TT) decompositions to tame the curse of
dimensionality. By reformulating the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and
Fokker-Planck equations as a sequence of advection-diffusion-reaction
subproblems within a smoothed policy iteration, we construct both first and
second order in time SL schemes. The TT format and appropriate quadrature rules
reduce storage and computational cost from exponential to polynomial in the
dimension. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our TT-accelerated SL methods
achieve their theoretical convergence rates, exhibit modest growth in memory
usage and runtime with dimension, and significantly outperform grid-based SL in
accuracy per CPU second.

Motivation: 研究旋转玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体基态的数值计算方法，特别是解决Gross-Pitaevskii能量泛函在质量守恒约束下的最小化问题。

Method: 采用三种Sobolev梯度流方案：H₀¹方案、a₀方案和a_u方案，分析它们在旋转情况下的收敛性。

Result: 证明了H₀¹和a₀方案在旋转情况下的全局收敛性，以及所有三种方案在基态附近的局部线性收敛性。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 三种Sobolev梯度流方案在旋转玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体基态计算中都具有良好的收敛性能，为相关数值计算提供了理论保证。

Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of the ground state of
rotating Bose--Einstein condensates, formulated as the minimization of the
Gross--Pitaevskii energy functional under a mass conservation constraint. To
solve this problem, we consider three Sobolev gradient flow schemes: the
$H_0^1$ scheme, the $a_0$ scheme, and the $a_u$ scheme. Convergence of these
schemes in the non-rotating case was established by Chen et al., and the
rotating $a_u$ scheme was analyzed in Henning et al. In this work, we prove the
global convergence of the $H_0^1$ and $a_0$ schemes in the rotating case, and
establish local linear convergence for all three schemes near the ground state.
Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 研究Waveholtz这种时域迭代方法在求解Helmholtz方程时的收敛性质，特别是在全空间中的常数系数情况

Method: 分析Waveholtz迭代与Helmholtz方程出射解之间的差异，证明该差异满足特定强迫项的Helmholtz方程，并使用加权Sobolev范数进行频率显式估计

Result: 获得了频率显式的加权Sobolev范数估计，证明差异随迭代次数n以1/√n的速率减小

Conclusion: Waveholtz方法的实部迭代收敛到Helmholtz方程出射解的实部

Abstract: In this paper we analyse the Waveholtz method, a time-domain iterative method
for solving the Helmholtz iteration, in the constant-coefficient case in all of
$\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that the difference between a Waveholtz iterate and the
outgoing Helmholtz solution satisfies a Helmholtz equation with a particular
kind of forcing. For this forcing, we prove a frequency-explicit estimate in
weighted Sobolev norms, that shows a decrease of the differences as
$1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the iteration number $n$. This guarantees the
convergence of the real parts of the Waveholtz iterates to the real part of the
outgoing solution of the Helmholtz equation.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种保守半拉格朗日间断伽辽金方法(CSLDG)用于Vlasov-Poisson系统离散化，该方法在准中性极限下具有渐近保持性质，结合CSLDG离散化和重构Poisson方程实现可靠数值解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在准中性极限下保持渐近性质的数值方法，用于复杂静电等离子体的准确和鲁棒数值模拟，即使空间和时间分辨率不能完全解析德拜长度。

Method: 使用保守半拉格朗日间断伽辽金(CSLDG)离散化结合重构Poisson方程(RPE)，CSL确保局部质量守恒并规避CFL条件，DG方法提供高精度捕捉分布函数精细结构。

Result: 严格证明了该方法具有渐近稳定性、一致性和渐近保持性质，在非准中性和准中性区域均保持效率，数值实验验证了准确性、稳定性和效率。

Conclusion: CSLDG方法为复杂静电等离子体模拟提供了准确、鲁棒且高效的数值工具，特别适用于准中性极限情况下的可靠计算。

Abstract: We discretize the Vlasov-Poisson system using conservative semi-Lagrangian
(CSL) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes that are asymptotic preserving (AP)
in the quasi-neutral limit. The proposed method (CSLDG) relies on two key
ingredients: the CSLDG discretization and a reformulated Poisson equation
(RPE). The use of the CSL formulation ensures local mass conservation and
circumvents the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, while the DG method provides
high-order accuracy for capturing fine-scale phase space structures of the
distribution function. The RPE is derived by the Poisson equation coupled with
moments of the Vlasov equation. The synergy between the CSLDG and RPE
components makes it possible to obtain reliable numerical solutions, even when
the spatial and temporal resolution might not fully resolve the Debye length.
We rigorously prove that the proposed method is asymptotically stable,
consistent and satisfies AP properties. Moreover, its efficiency is maintained
across non-quasi-neutral and quasi-neutral regimes. These properties of our
approach are essential for accurate and robust numerical simulation of complex
electrostatic plasmas. Several numerical experiments verify the accuracy,
stability and efficiency of the proposed CSLDG schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可持续能源发展增加了电力负荷的不确定性，输电系统运营商需要更高空间分辨率的负荷预测，从区域级扩展到节点级，但节点负荷预测精度较低且管理困难。

Method: 设计多级预测系统，使用可解释和可扩展的预测模型，通过完全并行化的单模型预测工作流程，解决节点负荷的异质性和波动性问题。

Result: 区域预测的准确性和可解释性得到改善，节点预测有显著提升，运营商能够以前所未有的信心和准确性调整预测，并精确诊断错误。

Conclusion: 多级预测系统成功满足了运营商对小时级日前负荷预测的需求，实现了从区域到节点预测的平稳过渡，提高了电网运营的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

TL;DR: 提出了TangledFeatures框架，用于在相关特征空间中进行特征选择，通过识别纠缠预测因子组中的代表性特征来减少冗余并保留解释力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关特征组中的代表性特征，减少冗余性同时保持解释能力。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测主链扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供了一种比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的特征子集，可直接应用于下游模型。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

### [157] [ES-C51: Expected Sarsa Based C51 Distributional Reinforcement Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15006)
*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的C51分布强化学习算法ES-C51，用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习更新，解决了当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于价值的RL算法只估计期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计整个奖励概率分布。C51是流行的离散动作空间DRL算法，但使用贪婪Bellman更新可能导致在多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时学习不稳定。

Method: 提出ES-C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替代C51的贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax计算结合状态所有可能动作的信息，而不是依赖单一最佳动作。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏中评估，ES-C51在多数环境中优于使用softmax探索的QL-C51（标准C51的修改版本）。

Conclusion: ES-C51通过Expected Sarsa更新有效解决了分布强化学习中的不稳定性问题，能够学习到性能更高的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Conclusion: 该方法通过预测性维护显著减少涡轮机故障，提高大规模风能部署的运营效率，具有重要社会价值。

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的方法使用(小)批量采样来估计传输计划，限制了在大规模高维数据集上的可扩展性。

Method: 利用半离散最优传输(SDOT)将噪声空间划分为Laguerre单元，每个单元映射到对应的数据点，在训练期间通过SDOT映射将独立同分布噪声样本与数据点配对。

Conclusion: AlignFlow可作为即插即用组件有效改进流式生成模型的训练，在大规模数据集和复杂模型架构上表现出色。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: SPA框架通过自监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外环境中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外场景中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐。传统RL训练在这种条件下难以扩展，探索脆弱且泛化能力有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模两个组件，通过自监督微调阶段冷启动策略，学习与环境交互的世界模型，然后在策略优化前使用该模型模拟未来状态

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等多样化环境中显著提升性能：Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升至70.9%（Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct模型）

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型可以更好地将推理与环境动态对齐，改善决策制定，SPA框架简单有效，大幅提升了RL智能体训练性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多层可配置时变马尔可夫决策过程(MCTVMDP)，其中智能体不仅可以通过原始动作优化策略，还能通过上层模型改变动作主动修改环境动态模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境是给定或固定的，但本文考虑智能体能够主动修改环境模型本身，通过重新配置底层转移过程来增加奖励。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，下层MDP具有可通过上层模型改变动作配置的非平稳转移函数，智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。

Result: 提出了一个能够处理主动环境修改的强化学习框架，使智能体能够通过改变环境动态来提升长期奖励。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP为智能体提供了超越被动适应的能力，通过主动修改环境模型可以更有效地优化长期性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过采样器、自动化管道和FTPO微调方法，有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式，在保持性能的同时显著减少90%的slop问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性重复短语模式（称为"slop"），这会降低输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：Antislop采样器（使用回溯抑制不想要的字符串）、自动化管道（分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据）、FTPO微调方法（在单个token级别调整logits）。

Result: Antislop采样器成功抑制8000+模式，而token banning在2000模式时就不可用；FTPO实现90%的slop减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或改进性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架有效解决了LLM输出中的slop问题，FTPO方法在保持模型性能的同时显著减少重复模式，优于DPO方法。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

Conclusion: 这些结果代表了向双光子光刻系统基于状态的维护迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

Motivation: 相关聚类的ℓ_p范数目标在最小化总分歧(ℓ₁)和保证个体公平性(ℓ_∞)之间存在基本权衡。离线设置中可同时近似所有范数，但标准随机顺序在线模型存在根本性分离，需要探索超越最坏情况的模型。

Method: 在在线样本模型(AOS)中，给定输入的一小部分作为样本，设计单一算法同时处理所有ℓ_p范数目标，利用样本信息来指导在线决策。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中：对所有ℓ_p范数高概率达到O(log⁴n)竞争比；对ℓ_∞范数高概率达到O(logn)竞争比；对ℓ₁范数期望达到O(1)竞争比。同时证明标准RO模型中ℓ_∞范数至少需要Ω(n¹/³)竞争比。

Conclusion: 成功将离线"全范数"保证扩展到在线世界，证明了AOS模型的有效性，并为相关聚类的公平性目标提供了实用的在线解决方案。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归和扩散模型在预测PDE控制的高维动态时存在累积误差和离散化伪影，限制了长期物理一致性预测的能力。

Method: 使用潜在流匹配模型，结合稀疏条件化和通道折叠技术，采用时间条件化傅里叶层来高效处理三维时空场并捕捉多尺度模式。

Result: 在三个基准PDE数据集上超越了现有最优方法，谱分析显示能更好地恢复多尺度动态，效率研究表明相比基于注意力或卷积的回归器具有更少的参数和内存需求。

Conclusion: TempO模型通过流匹配方法实现了高效、确定性的采样，在PDE动态预测任务中表现出优越的性能和效率。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进强化学习优化方法，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持高准确率的同时显著缩短输出长度，实现了最优的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理语言模型虽然性能强大，但生成了不必要的冗长输出。最大化每个token的智能度（准确率相对于响应长度）仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单的截断长度惩罚，解决了强化学习中的优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号问题。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少70%以上，同时超过所有先前基线的准确率。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B，并行生成多个简洁响应时准确率提高28%且延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER展示了通过改进强化学习优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以实现高效的准确率-效率权衡，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Result: 模型能够合理捕捉整体变形趋势，计算成本降低了几个数量级，但尚未达到完整有限元仿真的精度水平。

Conclusion: 证明了机器学习在结构碰撞动力学中应用的可行性，为快速设计探索和早期优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

TL;DR: 提出KME-CLIP方法，通过再生核希尔伯特空间的内积来改进CLIP中的相似度计算机制，更好地利用点互信息的线性结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用点互信息(PMI)的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态相似度应与PMI对应

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用内积来近似PMI，理论上可以任意精度逼近PMI

Result: 在多个检索和分类任务中，KME-CLIP整体优于标准CLIP

Conclusion: 通过利用PMI的线性结构，KME-CLIP能够更有效地计算跨模态相似度，提升多模态对比预训练性能

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

### [171] [A Simple Method for PMF Estimation on Large Supports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15132)
*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，适用于多模态和重尾分布，通过数据依赖的低通滤波实现平滑估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大离散支撑集上多模态和重尾PMF的估计问题，传统方法在处理噪声和保持粗粒度结构方面存在局限。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯加经验PMF对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间，最后进行裁剪和重归一化。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能有效保持粗粒度结构并抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、计算可靠、运行速度快，适合自动化流程和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失效模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Result: BiLSTM在测试集上取得RMSE 6.38，优于LSTM-Attention(9.19，提升30.6%)和线性滞后回归基线(提升35.4% RMSE)，在MAE和MAPE指标上也有并行改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明：使用长历史数据训练的模型泛化能力最好；适中的回看窗口(20-30周)提供强上下文；双向编码对捕捉窗口内的累积和后续模式至关重要；短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Motivation: 特征学习（神经网络在训练过程中调整内部表示）仍然缺乏深入理解。本文旨在通过统计物理方法建立理论框架来理解特征学习的机制。

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导自洽平均场理论，描述两层非线性网络在SGLD训练下的贝叶斯后验。在基础平均场理论基础上，进一步引入自增强输入特征选择机制来改进理论预测。

Result: 无限宽度下理论退化为核岭回归，有限宽度下预测了对称性破缺相变。基础平均场理论半定量预测了FL的起始，但低估了泛化改进。加入自增强特征选择机制后，理论能定量匹配SGLD训练网络的学习曲线。

Conclusion: 平均场理论结合自增强输入特征选择机制为特征学习提供了机制性理解，能够定量描述神经网络在有限宽度下的学习行为。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Method: 使用MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据，构建两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段整合DXA影像特征进行精炼

Result: 模型经过内外验证，在不同队列中表现一致且适应性强，相比T-score和FRAX具有更高敏感性和更少漏诊病例

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Motivation: Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中广泛应用，但其性能受表示几何和归一化的影响尚未完全理解，这限制了其下游应用。

Method: 在多样化图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案上进行综合实证研究，分析表示几何与OOD性能的关系，并提出径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法。

Conclusion: 通过桥接表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

### [179] [ReasonIF: Large Reasoning Models Fail to Follow Instructions During Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15211)
*Yongchan Kwon,Shang Zhu,Federico Bianchi,Kaitlyn Zhou,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ReasonIF基准来评估大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现现有模型存在显著失败，并探索了两种改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有研究主要关注模型主要回复的指令遵循，但推理过程中的指令遵循对模型的可控性、透明性和安全性同样重要。

Method: 构建ReasonIF基准，包含六类指令提示，评估多个开源LRM的推理指令遵循能力，并探索多轮推理和推理指令微调(RIF)两种改进策略。

Result: 现有LRM的推理指令遵循得分普遍低于0.25，且任务难度增加时表现更差。RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力严重不足，需要进一步研究改进，RIF方法显示出一定效果但仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

*Xuansheng Wu,Xiaoman Pan,Wenlin Yao,Jianshu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，不同基础模型在可验证奖励强化学习(RLVR)后的推理表现差异源于其内部对规则合理性的感知能力。高潜力模型能系统区分严格规则与噪声规则的概率分布，而弱模型则无法区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么不同预训练模型在RLVR后的推理表现差异巨大，寻找导致这种差异的微观特性。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器从潜在空间提取特征，估计特征间转移概率，并用LLM对规则进行合理性分类。

Result: 发现高潜力模型具有合理性感知能力，其内部概率分布在严格规则与噪声规则间显著分离，而弱模型则无法区分。提出的SAL指标能准确预测RLVR后推理性能(R^2=0.87)。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练时区分可靠知识与不可靠知识的内在能力相关，这为选择和设计更强基础模型提供了基于内部机制的实际指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: 基于MIMIC-III数据库，使用集成学习方法开发脑膜炎诊断模型，通过随机森林、LightGBM和深度神经网络作为基础模型，逻辑回归作为元模型，在两个测试集上分别获得0.9637和0.9472的AUC值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建具有挑战性的脑膜炎诊断条件，模拟真实急诊室场景，为未来AI驱动的脑膜炎诊断方法铺平道路。

Method: 使用214名脑膜炎患者和46,303名非脑膜炎患者数据，经过数据预处理和两阶段特征选择，选择性别和高风险ICD代码等临床相关特征。采用集成学习方法，将随机森林、LightGBM和DNN作为基础模型，逻辑回归作为元模型进行堆叠。

Result: 模型在两个测试集上表现优异，测试集1的AUC为0.9637，测试集2的AUC为0.9472。

Conclusion: 虽然直接部署临床可用的诊断工具具有挑战性，但本研究为未来使用集成学习的AI驱动脑膜炎诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud

\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，通过应力感知指数倾斜处理分布漂移下的序列决策问题，在KL漂移路径长度约束下实现O(√T)动态遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布漂移环境下的序列决策问题，传统方法对分布变化敏感，需要开发能够适应漂移的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入应力感知指数倾斜，通过Fenchel对偶等价性统一信念倾斜和决策倾斜。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度ST下实现O(√T)动态遗憾，无参数对冲算法可自适应未知漂移，过倾斜会导致Ω(λ²T)的平稳惩罚。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一个应力自适应的更新方法，可扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈、异常值处理等场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害特性，在真实金融应用中部署LLM仍然具有挑战性，需要专门的可信度评估基准。

Method: 构建FinTrust基准，基于实际金融场景设计广泛的对齐问题，为每个可信度维度创建细粒度评估任务，评估了11个LLM模型。

Result: 专有模型如o4-mini在大多数任务（如安全性）中表现更好，而开源模型如DeepSeek-V3在特定领域（如行业级公平性）具有优势。所有模型在受托责任对齐和披露等挑战性任务上都表现不足，显示法律意识存在显著差距。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，帮助识别和改进模型在金融应用中的可信度问题。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

TL;DR: 提出了TESSERA方法，一种结合专家混合模型和保形校准的不确定性量化方法，在蛋白质-配体亲和力预测中提供可靠的覆盖保证和自适应预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的有效应用。特别是在药物发现中，蛋白质-配体亲和力预测面临异质性噪声、不平衡化学空间和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA方法结合专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供每个样本的不确定性，具有可靠的覆盖保证、信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度。

Result: 在独立同分布和基于支架的分布外分割下，TESSERA实现了接近名义覆盖率和最佳的覆盖-宽度权衡，同时保持竞争力的适应性。大小分层覆盖分析确认区间大小合适。

Conclusion: 通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，TESSERA提供了可信、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道和其他应用中的选择性预测和下游决策。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

Motivation: 强化学习在可验证答案任务上有效扩展思维链推理，但扩展到更一般的非可验证偏好任务仍然具有挑战性且研究不足。

Method: 提出双权重强化学习框架，包含实例级错位权重和组级条件偏好分数，训练生成式偏好模型首先生成思维然后预测人类偏好分数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模上，DWRL始终优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯、可解释的思维。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可超越可验证任务应用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Motivation: 准确预测禽类疾病暴发对野生动物保护和公共卫生至关重要，需要开发能够预测候鸟迁徙终点疾病风险的早期预警系统。

Method: 使用Transformer架构，整合多源数据集（Movebank的GPS追踪数据、WOAH的疫情记录、GADM和Natural Earth的地理空间数据），通过H3分层地理空间编码处理原始坐标，从鸟类移动序列中学习时空依赖关系。

Result: 在测试集上表现出强大的预测性能：准确率0.9821、ROC曲线下面积0.9803、平均精度0.9299、F1分数0.8836。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在支持禽类疾病监测的早期预警系统方面具有巨大潜力，能够实现及时的干预和预防策略。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These

*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移和对抗性评估中显著提升提示的可靠性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动提示搜索方法在分布偏移和对抗评估中性能下降的问题，因为这些方法仅针对单一评估分布优化期望性能。

Method: 将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用。

Result: 在形式化重写任务中准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在域偏移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务保持96%以上性能。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习结合，为真实世界不确定性下的可靠、可迁移提示对齐提供了即插即用的通用方法。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了在尺度不变架构中μP方法在训练稳态阶段学习率传递失效的问题，实现了跨宽度的零-shot超参数迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练快速进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层导致反向尺度敏感性，有效学习率变得宽度依赖，破坏了μP方法的学习率传递能力。

Method: 引入权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，结合矩阵参数学习率缩放η₂∝d⁻¹和向量参数固定学习率η₁=Θ_d(1)且λ₁=0，保持子层增益跨宽度不变。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则，实现了学习率和权重衰减的零-shot迁移，无需针对每个宽度进行超参数搜索。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP方法扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 基础模型正在催化新的科学范式，需要科学界理解其变革作用并反思科学发现的未来

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Motivation: 传统集合数据同化方法在分析精度和计算效率之间存在权衡，大集合规模提高精度但增加计算成本

Method: 使用较小集合规模的EnKF生成初步分析状态，然后通过全连接神经网络学习并预测校正项来补偿有限集合规模导致的性能下降

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法通过结合传统数据同化和机器学习，有效解决了精度与效率的权衡问题，且具有良好的适应性和扩展性

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA展示了在动态现实世界去中心化网络中的鲁棒性和实用性，为处理异构数据提供了有效的去中心化解决方案。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Motivation: 研究RFLAF模型的泛化性质，旨在通过数据依赖的采样方案显著减少所需的特征数量，提高模型效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案生成特征，提出近似核查找算法来学习加权RFLAF，并与普通采样方案进行对比。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有限秩时甚至可降至Ω(1)；Lipschitz损失边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε²)^{1/t})。

Conclusion: 加权RFLAF在显著减少特征数量的情况下仍能保持相同性能，验证了理论结果的有效性，为高效核方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络防御方法通常只针对单一攻击类型，缺乏能够同时防御多种威胁的统一方法。

Method: 使用混合专家架构，设计基于互信息的逻辑多样性损失使不同专家关注不同邻域结构，并引入鲁棒性感知路由器识别扰动模式并自适应路由节点。

Result: 在各种对抗设置下的广泛实验表明，该方法在抵御多种图对抗攻击方面始终表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于MoE的统一防御框架能够有效同时防御多种图对抗攻击，提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 该工作为序列建模提供了基于算子理论的新视角，通过谱分解和MMD梯度流实现了高效的学习和采样。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Conclusion: BREEZE通过增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效解决了零样本强化学习中的关键挑战，为预训练通用策略的零样本适应提供了改进方案。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available
at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.

Conclusion: SWFP提供了一种高效稳定的方法来微调预训练流策略，具有简化的子模型训练、降低的计算/内存成本以及基于Wasserstein信任区域的可证明稳定性等优势。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了"深度信仰"，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于置信度估计的理论框架来分析基于采样的测试时缩放方法，揭示了自一致性和困惑度方法的局限性，并提出了结合两者优势的RPC混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于采样的测试时缩放方法在实践中取得了成功，但其理论基础尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，为这类方法提供理论分析框架。

Method: 提出了RPC方法，包含两个关键组件：困惑度一致性（结合自一致性和困惑度的优势）和推理剪枝（消除低概率推理路径）。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验表明，RPC在保持与自一致性相当推理性能的同时，不仅提高了置信度可靠性，还将采样成本降低了50%。

Conclusion: RPC通过理论指导的混合方法有效解决了现有测试时缩放方法的局限性，在减少推理错误方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于鞍点问题的隐变量能量基模型训练方法，通过耦合Wasserstein梯度流进行最大似然训练，无需判别器或辅助网络。


<details>

Motivation: 隐变量能量基模型能够同时进行生成建模和捕获隐藏结构，但传统训练方法存在局限性。本文旨在开发一种更有效的训练框架。

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为潜变量和联合流形分布上的鞍点问题，使用耦合Wasserstein梯度流，交替进行过阻尼Langevin更新和随机参数上升。

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离衰减率得到保证。在物理系统数值近似上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了比受限摊销后验更紧的ELBO下界，在可比较方法中具有竞争力，为LVEBM训练提供了新的理论框架和实用算法。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

TL;DR: 该论文研究从正确演示中学习生成答案的问题，提出了一种基于低基数奖励模型假设的新方法，替代了传统的最大似然估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型属于低基数类是一个更弱的假设，在这种假设下最大似然方法可能失败。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文老虎机中的离线模仿学习，基于奖励模型在低基数类中的假设，设计了一种样本复杂度与奖励类基数对数相关的新方法。

Result: 证明了最大似然方法在这种情况下可能失败，而新方法能够以对数样本复杂度学习。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越最大似然估计的方法，特别是在奖励模型属于低基数类的情况下。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Motivation: 解决在存在分配偏差情况下的反事实预测问题，避免传统对抗性训练的不稳定性和调参负担。

Method: 学习一个随机表示Z，在预测结果的同时最小化I(Z;T)，推导出可处理的变分目标上界信息项，并与监督解码器耦合。

Result: 在受控数值模拟和真实临床数据集上评估，在似然度、反事实误差和政策评估指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗性训练不稳定性的同时，在反事实预测任务上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Motivation: 传统强化学习需要预定义模拟器和奖励函数，这通常耗时耗力。OffSim旨在直接从专家轨迹中学习这些组件，减少人工设计成本。

Method: 联合优化高熵转移模型和IRL奖励函数，增强探索性并提高奖励泛化能力。OffSim+扩展支持多数据集设置，引入边际奖励进一步改善探索。

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够有效从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，实现离线策略训练，为强化学习提供了一种无需人工设计模拟器和奖励函数的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SESA框架，通过顺序采样生成多样化解决方案草图，解决强化学习中探索不足和熵崩溃问题，提升LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在训练大语言模型时存在探索有限和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步提升。

Method: SESA顺序采样框架：首先生成多样化解决方案草图，然后将其扩展为完整推理路径，通过条件化每个新输出于先前输出，促进过程多样性并防止策略崩溃。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和崩溃恢复方面优于传统RL方法；在三个智能体基准测试中，成功率分别提升+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相对基线RL最高提升211%）。

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了结构化方法，为RL训练的大语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件（如非线性激活和归一化）本质上是非单射的，可能阻止从模型表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 首先从数学上证明Transformer语言模型的单射性，然后通过数十亿次碰撞测试进行实证验证，最后提出SipIt算法实现从隐藏激活中精确重建输入文本。

Result: 理论证明和实证测试均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，SipIt算法能够在线性时间内精确重建输入文本，实际应用中实现了精确可逆性。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用的特性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Result: 实验表明蒸馏效果在低数据量场景下不仅保持而且被放大，推翻了蒸馏可视为标签平滑的假设，为暗知识假说提供了进一步证据。

Conclusion: 数据集大小可能是支撑蒸馏机制的一个基本但被忽视的变量，蒸馏的数据效率特性为理解其工作原理提供了新视角。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

Motivation: 评估MC Dropout不确定性在识别脑肿瘤MRI分割错误方面的有效性，特别是在肿瘤边界区域。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数与像素级误差进行相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05），不同增强设置间的差异虽统计显著但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性对边界错误定位的提示作用有限，需要在医学图像分割中开发替代或混合的不确定性估计方法。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要开放问题。神经特征假设(NFA)描述了训练后第一层权重Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均值(AGOP)之间的幂律关系，需要验证其在更广泛网络架构中的有效性。

Method: 采用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化假设，分析多层线性网络的训练动态。通过理论证明和数值实验验证NFA在不同优化算法、权重衰减率和初始化方案下的表现。

Result: 证明对于L≥2层的线性网络，NFA在整个训练过程中成立，指数α=1/L，显示了NFA的深度依赖性。在非平衡初始化下应用权重衰减时，NFA渐近成立。同时发现某些非线性激活网络即使能很好拟合训练数据，NFA也不成立。

Conclusion: NFA在多层线性网络中具有深度依赖性，其指数与网络层数成反比。权重衰减有助于在非平衡初始化下实现NFA，但非线性激活可能破坏NFA的成立条件。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，在联合图上执行迭代消息传递，通过学习划分函数来近似模型数量，并在联合图的簇内和簇间应用注意力机制。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上测试，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存降低达94.9%，在三个真实应用场景中延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存降低18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING通过利用相对排名和序列级稀疏性的洞察，实现了无需训练的高效推理，显著提升了边缘AI服务的效率和部署能力。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

*Parsa Abbasi,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CQD-SHAP是一个基于Shapley值的新框架，用于解释复杂查询回答中各个查询部分对特定答案排名的贡献，解决了现有神经符号方法缺乏查询部分重要性解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复杂查询回答方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏用户信任。虽然神经符号方法如CQD允许跟踪中间结果，但无法解释查询各部分的重要性。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算每个查询部分对答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释的自动评估中，与多个基线方法比较，显示该方法对大多数查询类型都有效。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP提供了解释复杂查询回答中查询部分贡献的有效方法，增强了模型的可解释性和用户信任。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

TL;DR: 提出了基于位运算的Tsetlin Machine高效软件实现，通过早期退出机制和文字重排序策略，在ARM处理器上实现高达96.71%的推理时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用Tsetlin Machine在CPU上的高速度推理特性，通过指令级位运算实现紧凑模型表示和加速处理，进一步优化推理性能。

Method: 1) 使用位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；2) 引入基于AND子句评估的早期退出机制避免不必要计算；3) 提出文字重排序策略最大化早期退出概率；4) 在训练后、推理前阶段通过统计分析和Tsetlin Automata动作应用该策略。

Result: 在gem5模拟器中使用ARM处理器的实验结果显示，相比传统基于整数的TM实现，推理时间减少高达96.71%，同时保持相当的代码密度。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化实现显著提升了Tsetlin Machine的推理效率，为资源受限设备上的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出WARP-LUTs方法，一种基于梯度的新型方法，通过显著减少可训练参数来高效学习逻辑门组合，在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛更快且保持相当精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs在训练时计算成本高，且对更多输入的逻辑块泛化能力差，需要更高效的训练方法和更好的可扩展性。

Method: 使用Walsh辅助松弛概率查找表(WARP-LUTs)，这是一种基于梯度的优化方法，通过减少可训练参数来学习逻辑门组合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，WARP-LUTs比DLGNs收敛速度显著更快，同时保持了相当的准确率。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs方法展示了扩展到更高输入逻辑块的潜力，为在现代FPGA上实现极高效部署及其实时科学应用提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN是一个测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数来提升推理任务的性能，无需重新训练大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法（如Best-of-N采样）在N增加时收益递减，存在效率问题。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后学习输入特定的温度T和偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上的实验显示，CarBoN效率提升4倍，在固定预算下达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效平衡输出多样性和正确性，并可推广到束搜索等步骤级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要寻找更快速、成本更低的替代方案。

Method: 开发自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM等经典算法比较，使用9000样本数据集和10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM实现100%准确率，KS-Net达到99.98%准确率，仅有两个错误分类。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法能够高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为加速电机设计、开发自动转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断提供基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了CAP方法，在约束特征空间中生成通用对抗扰动，通过增强拉格朗日最小最大优化确保满足领域特定约束，在金融、网络等多个领域实现了更高的攻击成功率和更低的运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽视了领域特定的特征关系约束，导致生成的对抗样本在实际应用中不可行或容易被检测，限制了其现实适用性。

Method: 提出CAP算法，基于增强拉格朗日最小最大优化框架，使用梯度交替优化策略来强制满足多个复杂约束条件。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域评估显示，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间，并能无缝推广到个体对抗扰动。

Conclusion: CAP方法有效解决了约束特征空间中的对抗攻击问题，并提出了从数据中学习特征约束的原则性方法，为结构化输入空间的广泛应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一个通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的模型，能够自动简化Lean证明，无需人工监督，显著压缩证明长度并提升验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经定理证明生成的证明过长，难以被人类理解，限制了数学洞察力。现有方法在处理RL训练证明器生成的超长证明时效果不佳，且缺乏训练数据。

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ProofOptimizer显著压缩证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中验证更快，作为训练数据还能提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督就能简化Lean证明的语言模型，有效解决了证明过长的问题，为数学定理证明提供了实用的简化工具。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

Motivation: 解决强化学习系统的安全性问题，在追求最优性能的同时提供形式化的安全保障，确保部署时的安全性。

Method: 通过风险预算增强约束MDP状态空间，使用学习到的成本批评器对智能体策略分布应用屏蔽，确保所有采样动作在期望意义下安全。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，提供仅依赖于备份批评器准确度的成本期望紧上界，实验显示在训练期间也能保证安全性。

Conclusion: ProSh在模型无关设置下实现了安全强化学习，通过概率屏蔽机制在训练和部署阶段都能提供形式化的安全保障。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

<details>

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要手动设计奖励函数，这限制了方法的可扩展性和效率。

Method: 使用DFA结构生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包含静态方法（直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化）和动态方法（通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略）。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法在处理时间依赖性任务时优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法，如奖励机器和LTL引导方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法为处理非马尔可夫奖励提供了一种可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的替代方案，在标准假设下能够学习到接近最优的策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，需要寻找准确的深度学习替代模型。

Method: 使用图神经网络和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络框架，采用课程学习策略（数据预训练+物理信息微调）。

Result: GNN明显优于U-Net，最差的GCN框架相对L2误差为8.7%，而最佳U-Net为13.0%。MPNN和Graph Transformer分别达到3.5%和2.6%的误差。物理信息神经网络将误差降低达11.3%。

Conclusion: 虽然Graph Transformer最准确，但推理速度比MPNN慢37.5%。PINN增强的MPNN在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间提供了最佳平衡，是最实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

TL;DR: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)方法，通过自适应混合策略增强持续学习中的网络校准和性能，减少过度自信和遗忘，提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准的重要性。神经崩溃现象在持续学习中具有优势，但很少有工作致力于改进持续模型的校准以实现更可靠的预测。

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对基于神经崩溃方法的自适应混合策略。SAMix根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SAMix显著提升了性能，在持续学习中超越了最先进方法，同时改进了模型校准。SAMix提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统稳健性的有前景的进展，既增强了准确率又提高了预测的可靠性。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and

dynamics simulations requiring orders of magnitudes less compute than
traditional numerical solvers. In this technical report, we add two new
datasets to the body of empirically evaluated use-cases of AB-UPT, combining
high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了在现实世界多变量数据和协变量场景中的应用。

Method: 使用组注意力机制促进跨多个时间序列的上下文学习，通过在合成数据集上训练来学习多样的多变量结构。

Result: 在fev-bench、GIFT-Eval和Chronos Benchmark II三个基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在涉及协变量的任务中显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为可在真实世界预测管道中直接使用的通用预测模型。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出SNOO优化器，通过将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiLoCo优化器在非分布式设置中意外表现出色，作者发现其有效性主要源于将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，因此希望开发一个更高效的变体。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，采用两循环框架，在快速权重上执行多个内部优化器步骤生成伪梯度轨迹，然后将Nesterov动量应用于该伪梯度来更新慢速权重。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算因子增益，训练FLOPs规模可达1e23，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增加。

Conclusion: SNOO因其最小的计算和内存开销以及与模型分片的兼容性，成为各种内部优化器（包括AdamW和Muon）的实用增强方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

TL;DR: 提出FIDDLE学习框架，通过高斯过程代理模型和强化学习模块，在量子电路路由阶段直接最大化过程保真度，优于依赖间接指标的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子设备受噪声影响，可靠性降低。量子计算中关键挑战是在编译过程中提高量子电路的可靠性，特别是在路由阶段。

Method: FIDDLE框架包含两个模块：基于高斯过程的代理模型用于有限训练样本下估计过程保真度，以及强化学习模块用于优化路由。

Result: 代理模型比现有学习技术能提供更好的过程保真度估计，端到端框架在各种噪声模型下显著提高了量子电路的过程保真度。

Conclusion: 这是首个直接最大化过程保真度的方法，优于依赖电路深度或门数等间接指标的传统方法。

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

TL;DR: TRON是一种新颖的神经网络架构，利用物种间的同源关系进行跨物种迁移学习，通过物种转换层将基因表达从源物种映射到目标物种。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决跨物种迁移学习中的生物学基础问题，利用同源关系指导知识迁移，提高转录组数据的有效利用。

Method: 在预训练的前馈神经网络前添加学习的物种转换层，该层的权重通过二分图的邻接矩阵进行掩码，学习源物种到目标物种基因表达的线性变换。

Result: 该方法提供了功能同源性的解释途径，揭示了不同物种基因对目标表型的贡献。

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种迁移学习提供了生物学基础和可解释的方法，为更有效利用转录组数据铺平了道路。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

TL;DR: 本文研究了相关probit模型的学习问题，该模型避免了IIA假设的限制。研究发现成对偏好数据不足以学习相关性信息，而三选一偏好数据能够有效克服这一限制，并提出了高效的估计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机效用模型(RUMs)在人类反馈强化学习中很重要，但传统方法依赖IIA假设，将所有人类偏好简化为单一效用函数，无法捕捉偏好的多样性。避免IIA假设的模型缺乏统计和计算保证。

Method: 研究相关probit模型的学习挑战，分析不同数据收集范式（成对偏好vs三选一偏好）的有效性，提出基于三选一偏好数据的统计和计算高效估计算法。

Result: 理论证明成对偏好数据无法学习相关性信息，而三选一偏好数据能够克服这一限制。提出的算法在多个真实数据集上验证了理论保证，实现了更好的人类偏好个性化建模。

Conclusion: 高阶偏好数据（如三选一）在建模相关效用方面具有优势，能够更精细地捕捉人类偏好的多样性，为个性化偏好建模提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化代理虽然平均最优性差距低于1%，但存在最坏情况下的较大差距，难以在实际中信任预测结果。需要在经典求解器和优化代理之间找到平衡，实现可信部署。

Method: 提出混合求解器，利用对偶理论高效地界定预测的最优性差距，对于无法保证最优性的查询回退到经典求解器。提出结合原始和对偶代理训练的替代训练过程以提高混合求解器的加速效果。

Result: 在大规模传输系统上的实验表明，混合求解器具有高度可扩展性，相比并行化单纯形求解器实现了1000倍以上的加速，同时保证最大最优性差距为2%。

Conclusion: 该混合方法在优化代理和经典求解器之间实现了良好的平衡，提供了可解释的速度-最优性权衡，能够实现可信的实际部署。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型生成的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型需要在信息不完整的情况下进行不确定性推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 构建了OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型合成背景信息并生成概率先验分布的能力，评估其准确性和校准度。

Result: 六个前沿语言模型生成的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信，性能仅随不确定性提取方式略有改善，但不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计的影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了具有挑战性的评估平台，可用于开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅靠观测充分性无法保证干预能力，因为观测等价的世界在干预下可能分化，需要转向以错误为中心的视角。

Method: 提出Causal Mechanics框架，将假设空间变化作为首要操作，引入局部性、自主性、独立因果机制和组合自主性等结构原则，提供可操作的诊断方法。

Result: 建立了将不可达错误转化为可达错误并进行修正的理论框架，为构建具有干预能力的AGI系统提供理论基础。

Conclusion: AGI发展需要理论突破，Causal Mechanics通过强调假设空间演化和错误修正机制，为解决理论限制问题提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Conclusion: HugAgent为推进机器推理更贴近人类个体思维提供了首个可扩展的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在个体推理适应方面的局限性，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应基于能力集群稳定性，采用因果中心性权重和持久性测试，而非对称权重和快照评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估存在两个问题：对称权重假设所有领域同等重要，快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。人类智力研究表明不同领域的重要性不同，且真正智能应能在扰动下保持稳定。

Method: 提出两种评估扩展：1) 中心性优先评分，采用CHC理论导出的权重和敏感性分析；2) 集群稳定性指数系列，评估配置持久性、持久学习和错误纠正能力。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了可测试的预测和黑盒协议。

Conclusion: 通用智能应被理解为稳态属性集群，AGI评估应关注能力在扰动下的共现机制，而非仅仅是能力集合。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM智能体与知识图谱交互的多维数据分析方法，构建动态协作分析生态系统，解决大语言模型在处理结构化知识时的幻觉问题和知识图谱的静态限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量、异构、复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。大语言模型在自然语言处理方面表现优异但存在幻觉问题，知识图谱能显式存储结构化知识但缺乏动态交互能力。

Method: 利用LLM智能体从非结构化数据中自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，并通过交互平台支持用户对图节点进行深度探索分析。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动的探索性分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过将像素级GUI交互构建为状态-动作知识图来解决API缺失环境下LLM代理的效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，迫使代理只能通过像素级GUI操作，导致LLM代理面临效率瓶颈：局限于局部视觉体验、短视决策和低效试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG-Agent框架，将原始像素交互构建为持久的状态-动作知识图，通过连接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态形成经验邻域，并设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂开放GUI决策环境中，KG-Agent在探索效率和战略深度方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过知识图结构有效解决了API缺失环境下的探索效率和长期规划问题，为GUI交互代理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统主要存储文本信息，忽略了多模态信号的重要性。受人类多模态记忆的启发，希望构建一个更符合认知科学原理的多模态代理系统。

Method: 系统包含编码、存储、检索和执行四个循环阶段。不同于使用向量数据库的传统方法，将信息概念化为语义标签，并将其与上下文关联存储在图形结构的多模态上下文记忆中，实现概念驱动的检索。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，在MSC基准测试中优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS系统通过模拟人类记忆机制，在多模态代理系统中实现了更高效的概念驱动检索，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

TL;DR: VERITAS是一个通过整合视觉先验和多模态模型来提升监督微调数据质量的管道，能有效减少事实错误和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型的监督微调数据质量不足，存在事实错误和幻觉问题，主要原因是视觉感知能力不足。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR系统提取结构化视觉先验，结合多个先进LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合得到高置信度共识分数，训练轻量级评判模型，最后选择最高分答案作为精炼结果。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型表现优于使用原始数据的模型，尤其在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中。评判模型能力接近先进LMM但效率更高。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升SFT数据质量，增强多模态模型的推理能力，同时发布的管道、数据集和模型检查点将推动多模态数据优化研究。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然提高了模型准确性，但会导致响应过长和过度思考问题，增加了推理延迟和计算消耗，特别是在需要最少推理的简单任务中。

Method: DEPO框架包含三个核心组件：(1)创新的优势解耦算法指导模型减少低效token；(2)难度感知长度惩罚降低模型响应整体长度；(3)优势裁剪方法防止策略优化偏差。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上的实验显示，DEPO显著减少序列长度39%，减少低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确性上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO有效解决了大推理模型在强化学习训练中的低效推理问题，在保持准确性的同时大幅降低了计算成本和推理延迟。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Motivation: 模拟集成电路布局由于严格的电气约束和问题特定要求，以及布局与布线步骤的相互依赖，机器学习技术的应用受到限制。布局工程师需要可用的布线感知布局解决方案。

Method: 使用强化学习和关系图卷积神经网络开发自动布局引擎，结合增加网格分辨率和精确引脚信息集成，以及动态布线资源估计技术，平衡布线效率和面积效率。

Result: 在模拟环境中评估布局和布线效果，相比过去基于学习的最先进技术，死区面积减少13.8%，线长减少40.6%，布线成功率提高73.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够满足工业标准，通过布线感知的布局生成实现了更好的布局质量。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

### [255] [Corrigibility Transformation: Constructing Goals That Accept Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15395)
*Rubi Hudson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了可修正性目标的概念，通过一种转换方法使任何目标都能在不牺牲性能的情况下变得可修正，从而避免AI在训练过程中抵制目标更新或关闭。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在部分学习目标后往往会抵制进一步的目标更新，因为继续追求现有目标通常更有利于实现这些目标。但可修正性对于训练收敛、纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化至关重要。

Method: 引入形式化定义，提出一种转换方法，通过近视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测来构建可修正版本的目标。该方法可递归扩展到新创建的代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验证明，这些可修正目标可以被有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 可修正性是一个关键的安全属性，本文提供的方法能够创建既具有可修正性又与不可修正替代方案具有竞争力的目标。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习结合战略游戏自博弈是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds提供了一个可扩展和可扩展的领域自适应AI助手基础架构，结合了多代理编排的灵活性和参数高效微调的效率。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临判断不一致性问题，这会破坏强化学习的稳定性。虽然之前研究关注判断准确性，但逻辑一致性特别是偏好循环问题尚未充分解决。

Method: 引入包含CDR指标和DGR框架的综合方法：CDR量化判断冲突，DGR通过构建偏好图、转换为无冲突有向无环图来净化信号，生成逻辑一致的奖励信号。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架相比强基线显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中关键且现在可管理的维度，该框架成功解决了判断不一致性问题。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降。需要开发能同时诊断多种故障的鲁棒诊断方法。

Method: MM-HCAN将对比学习集成到专门为多模态传感器融合设计的超图拓扑中，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展的鲁棒解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和资产寿命延长。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个基于结构化推理和加权共识竞赛机制的SQL候选选择框架，解决了文本到SQL任务中从多样化候选池中选择正确查询的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SQL选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）仅提供浅层信号，容易导致评分不一致、推理链脆弱，以及无法捕捉密切相关的SQL候选之间的细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励指导下提炼推理轨迹；构建加权共识竞赛机制，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出卓越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识竞赛重新定义了SQL候选选择，提供了更可靠和高效的查询选择方法。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，可增强医学风险预测的特异性，为扩大纵向健康监测项目提供了途径。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的实验协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集，提出"Sketch-and-Fill"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、动作顺序和语义保真度，开发Thoth模型通过分阶段知识到行动过程进行训练。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面实现显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行。所有数据、代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

TL;DR: 本文针对RLHF和DPO方法中忽略人类评估者多样性和二元比较限制的问题，提出了基于排名反馈的偏好学习方法和考虑异质偏好的对齐算法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽略了人类评估者的多样性以及成对反馈的局限性。

Method: 1) 将偏好学习与计量经济学文献联系，证明二元比较不足以识别潜在用户偏好；2) 开发DPO的EM变体，发现潜在标注者类型并训练混合LLM；3) 提出基于最小最大遗憾公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中面向多样化用户的公平性和个性化理论算法框架，确保可识别性和公平性能保证。

Conclusion: 通过排名反馈和异质偏好整合，为生成模型对齐提供了更全面的理论和方法基础，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Conclusion: 提出的评估指标为比较不同提取方法提供了标准化方式，并能突出字段级性能的优缺点。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for extracting structured information from
invoice documents and proposes a set of evaluation metrics (EM) to assess the
accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise

Motivation: 现有帕金森病多模态评估方法存在两个主要限制：(1)训练时需要同步所有模态，(2)推理时依赖所有模态，这阻碍了实际应用

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题

Result: 在三个公共数据集上，异步设置下比最佳基线提升16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，同步设置下提升4.86和2.30个百分点

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中表现出卓越的有效性和适应性，解决了多模态学习的实际应用限制

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多维问题（如司法框架、环境污染、疫情韧性等）时，现有LLM缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制。

Method: 构建Dialectica框架，让代理在定义主题上进行结构化对话，增强记忆、自我反思和政策约束的上下文编辑功能，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 在两种模型架构上的实验表明，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo分数、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域实现针对性专业知识放大的可行路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Motivation: 回应McMullen等人关于作者结果与文献中其他数值模拟结果存在矛盾的评论，澄清数值噪声的影响。

Method: 通过反例论证和文献对比，指出DNS结果中隐含的数值噪声并不会产生热涨落主导的范围，与作者结果一致。

Conclusion: 数值噪声对湍流统计有重要影响，所有数值方法都需要仔细检查数值噪声的影响，作者的结果与DNS结果并不矛盾。

Abstract: McMullen et al. [1] comment that the numerical simulations that explicitly
include random velocity fluctuations ``should exhibit a
thermal-fluctuation-dominated range'' consistent with the literature, so that
our results (J. Fluid Mech. 1008, R2, 2025) [2] ``contradict other results in
the literature''. First of all, we would give an opposite example against this
viewpoint: DNS results (that are badly polluted by numerical noises quickly, as
mention in Section 2) implicitly include random numerical noises, but they also
DO NOT exhibit a thermal-fluctuation-dominated range. In other words, DNS
results in the literature qualitatively agree with ours at this point. In
addition, we highly suggest that influences of numerical noises on statistics
of turbulent flows given by ALL numerical approaches should be carefully
checked, since numerical noises might have huge influences on statistics of
chaotic systems (including turbulence), as pointed by Lorenz [3] in 2006.

Motivation: 研究垂直轴涡轮机在河流和海洋环境中部署时，沉积物动态对涡轮机性能和环境影响的相互作用。

Method: 采用大涡模拟与床面形态动力学耦合的方法，使用执行器表面模型参数化涡轮机，浸入边界法处理流体与通道壁面及沉积层的相互作用。

Result: 较高叶尖速比会增强湍流，加速刚性床面上的尾流恢复，并在活床条件下增强涡轮下方和下游的侵蚀和沉积模式。活床条件下的床面变形通过射流产生不对称尾流结构，进一步加速尾流恢复，但使涡轮性能下降约2%。

Conclusion: 执行器表面框架的计算成本仅为涡轮解析方法的约4%，为评估流-沉积物-涡轮相互作用提供了一种高效而稳健的工具。

Abstract: We present a coupled large-eddy simulation (LES) and bed morphodynamics study
to investigate the influence of sediment dynamics on the performance of a
utility-scale marine hydrokinetic vertical-axis turbine (VAT) parametrized by
an actuator surface model. By resolving the two-way interactions between
turbine-induced flow structures and bed evolution, the study offers insights
into the environmental implications of VAT deployment in riverine and marine
settings. A range of tip speed ratios is examined to evaluate wake recovery,
power production, and bed response. The actuator surface method (ASM) is
implemented to capture the effects of rotating vertical blades on the flow,
while the immersed boundary method accounts for fluid interactions with the
channel walls and sediment layer. The results show that higher TSRs intensify
turbulence, accelerate wake recovery over rigid beds, and enhance erosion and
deposition patterns beneath and downstream of the turbine under live-bed
conditions. Bed deformation under live-bed conditions induces asymmetrical wake
structures through jet flows, further accelerating wake recovery and decreasing
turbine performance by about 2%, compared to rigid-bed conditions. Considering
the computational cost of the ASM framework, which is nearly $4\%$ of the
turbine-resolving approach, it provides an efficient yet robust tool for
assessing flow-sediment-turbine interactions.

Abstract: Turbulent behavior of the two-parameter family of generalized surface
quasigeostrophic equations is examined both rigorously and numerically. We
adapt a cascade mechanism argument to derive an energy spectrum that scales as
$\kappa^{2\beta/3-3}$ where $\beta$ controls the regularity of the velocity
($\beta=1$ in the special case of the SQG). Direct numerical simulations
indicate that this fits better than $\kappa^{\beta/3-3}$ which was derived in
earlier work. Guided by earlier work on the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, we
prove a certain condition implies a direct cascade of enstrophy, as well as an
upper bound on the enstrophy dissipation rate, and sharp bounds on a
dissipation wavenumber. The dependence of these rigorous results on the two
parameters is demonstrated numerically.

Result: 发现随着阵风比和阵风尺寸增加，流场和气动响应与基线流动出现显著偏差；初始涡流位置影响前缘速度梯度，调节升力响应幅度；升力波动随攻角增加至约10°后趋于平稳；较厚翼型导致阵风诱导升力波动幅度减小。

Conclusion: 参数空间探索揭示了相关趋势，特别强调了翼型几何形状在阵风相互作用中的重要性，填补了过去研究中关注较少的领域。

Abstract: Historically, investigations on gust encounters have been limited to thin
airfoils. In this work, we examine vortex-gust encounters by a family of
airfoils at a chord-based Reynolds number Re_c=100, which includes variations
in the gust ratio, initial gust position, gust radius, angle of attack, airfoil
thickness, and airfoil camber. We examine differences in the flow fields,
lift-element distributions, and aerodynamic responses across several
airfoil-gust interactions. We observe a large deviation of the flow fields and
aerodynamic responses with respect to the baseline flows for increasing gust
ratios and gust sizes. The initial position of the vortex gust influences the
magnitude of the velocity gradients observed near the leading edge, effectively
heightening or mitigating the amplitude of the lift response. Moreover, the
lift fluctuation increases with the angle of attack until it flattens around
$10^\circ$, reminiscent of an unsteady stall-like regime. Furthermore, we
report a decrease in the amplitude of the gust-induced lift fluctuations for
thicker airfoils, which we attribute to a decrease in the vorticity production
levels from the leading edge. The exploration of a sensitive subset of the
parameter space uncovers relevant trends, shedding light on regions that have
received limited attention in past studies, with special focus on the influence
of airfoil geometry.

Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible
Navier--Stokes equations with variable density that provides exact conservation
of volume and, accordingly, pure advection of the density variable. The spatial
discretization relies on hybrid velocity-density-pressure spaces and the
temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit
Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive
features that can be fruitfully exploited for the simulation of mixtures of
immiscible incompressible fluids, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of
volume enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the
convection dominated regime thanks to upwind stabilizations, weak imposition of
boundary conditions, implicit high-order accurate time stepping encompassing
unsteady boundary conditions, reduced memory footprint thanks to static
condensation, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution
strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. Numerical validation is
performed showcasing convergence rates, pressure-robustness and pure advection
of the density, thus we tackle the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at Reynolds
$1~000$ and $5~000$.
