Classical formulas by Fagnano, Euler, and Ramanujan, as\nwell as modern refinements such as Cantrell and Koshy methods, aim to reduce\nthe approximation error while maintaining computational simplicity. In this\npaper, we introduce a new closed-form expression that enhances Ramanujan second\nformula by dividing it by 1 minus a binomial of two exponential terms resulting\nin a very stable approximation in a range of b/a between 1 and 1/10000, or even\nup to a smaller ratio. The resulting approximation remains compact, requiring\nonly four constants, and achieving a remarkable tradeoff between simplicity and\naccuracy. Across the full eccentricity range of b/a in [0.0001,1], our method\nattains a maximum relative error of approximately 0.57 ppm with respect to the\nexact perimeter computed via elliptic integral. Our formula is quasi-exact at\nthe extremes, for the circle b/a=1 and for the degenerate flat ellipse b/a=0.\nCompared with Cantrell approximation, the proposed method reduces the maximum\nrelative error by a factor of 25 while preserving a short and elegant\nexpression. This makes it one of the simplest yet most accurate closed-form and\nsingle-line approximations to the ellipse perimeter currently available in the\nliterature."}

SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations.

Downstream, the mean flow gradually recovers toward a\nZPG-like state, but turbulence in the outer region retains a lasting impact of\nPGH.

Downstream recovery involves merging of large-scale\nwavelengths and the reorganisation of turbulence structures toward a ZPG-like\nstate - although the `recovered' VLSM streamwise length becomes shortened due\nto the mixing of lengthscales with the PG peak.

A promising approach is to reconstruct\nvisual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a\nlatent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct\nimages. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more\nsimilar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based\nspace or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the\ngenerative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of\nvisual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and\nrelationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that\nProjects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate\nrepresentation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric\ndiffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to\nreduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module\nthat automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align\nwith the neural activity.

The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements.

Their linear complexity and hidden-state\nrecurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,\nwhereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training\nmethods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to\nfully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are\noften trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic\nscaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models\nsuffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and\ntemporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal\ninflexibility.

For AIWP, we introduce a\nspatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning\n(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based\nglobal observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA\ninitialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.\nAdditionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in\nglobal precipitation forecasting."}

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval\napproaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and\ncomposition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete\ncapability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component\nselection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and\nreal-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,\nautomated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the\nknapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically\nidentify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly\nconsidering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically\ntesting candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our\napproach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable\nreuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five\nbenchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer\nconsistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at\nsignificantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the\nsingle-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate\nimprovement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In\nmulti-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from\n37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents.

We define targeted metrics\nwithin each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.\nThrough evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have\nfound that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when\nrecognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens\nsubstantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error\npatterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging\nconditions.

To address this, we introduce a novel\ndecision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ\nsensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to\noptimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline\nintegrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable\nsensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood\nreconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer\ntailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the\nincorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable\ngradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic\ndecision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained\ndisaster response tasks."}

For example, \"summer is approaching\" parallels \"We\nare approaching the summer\". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of\nreference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.\nExtending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines\nhow temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of\n\"now\". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in\nnatural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about\ntime remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding\nunder Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event\nand event-event relations when the reference point of \"now\" dynamically shifts\nalong a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition\n\\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the\ncurrent moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00\n(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment\nbetween the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit\nmeasurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking\naround the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The\nadaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while\nLLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning\nremains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance."}

Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities\ncorrespond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the\nneural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.\nEmpirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate\nimproved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate\ncompression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and\ncross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude\nby discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured\nneuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional\nlearning systems."}

This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder\nto focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation\nreinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual\nobjects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including\nNegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --\nreconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former\nencourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,\nwhile the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed\nwith different wording."}

Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that\nutilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of\nunseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,\nwe demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can\nbe applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP\nwas developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully\ndegrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation\nmodels - never seen before.

Standard approaches for this\ntask require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or\nnarrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full\nvideo offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online\ndecisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without\ntraining. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent\nLarge Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step\nassociated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.\nWe show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms\noffline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop\nBayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting\nknowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits\nBayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency\nmatrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step\nprogress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over\nstate-of-the-art training-based offline methods."}

Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation\n(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation\nintensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open\nImages V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves\naccuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24\npercentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.\nStatistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance\nof improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for\nanalyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems."}

Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache.

In this work,\nwe present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the\nnon-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.\n  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand\nand face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we\npropose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose\ntracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.\nSecond, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,\nmaking them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we\nlearn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand\ninteraction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of\nPCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field.

The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings.

To address these challenges, we introduce a generic\nneuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is\nencoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes\nthis encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a\nreliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,\nwe demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while\nmaintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected\nknowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,\nwhile exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input\nperturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks.

A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates\n(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment\nlesions.

The key insight behind our analysis is\nthat, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers\nforms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD\ndynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component\ncorresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while\nthe orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows\nus to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning\nrate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is\novercome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global\nminimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time\nwith a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)\nthe supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with\nlinear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat\nglobal minimum."}

This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,\nretaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for\nrobust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)\nmethods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific\ngeneralization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains\nfor each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL.

More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex\nrelationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while\nmaintaining physical consistency.

Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation\n(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation\nintensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open\nImages V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves\naccuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24\npercentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.\nStatistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance\nof improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for\nanalyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems."}

The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces\nstronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,\nboosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM.

This resource is enriched with four annotation\nlayers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and\nanatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative\nskill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.\nThe technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking\nexperiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene\nsegmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a\ndomain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model\non a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out\ncenter.

When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions\nof the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers.\nThis suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution\nfor one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the\nprompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show\nthat sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing\nperturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in\nblack-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling\nsemantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this\ndecomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is\nattributed to prompt sensitivity.
