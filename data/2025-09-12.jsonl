The analysis employs a high-fidelity\nfluid-structure interaction solver based on a partitioned variational\nformulation with a nonlinear iterative force correction scheme. Systematic\nsimulations are conducted over a broad parameter space of dimensionless heaving\namplitude and frequency at a Reynolds number of 3000. Five distinct response\nmodes are identified, namely full-wake, semi-wake, full-wake-flexible,\nsemi-wake-flexible, and vortex-flexible, based on propulsive transitions and\nassociated flow features. An empirical boundary plane is discovered, separating\nregimes where the wake hinders lift performance (wake-dominated) from those\nwhere it enhances performance (flapping-dominated). Scaling relations for the\nforce and power coefficients are formulated by decomposing the contributions of\nquasi-steady motion, added-mass effects, structural curvature, wake momentum\ndeficit, and transverse flow gradients. At sufficiently large amplitude and\nfrequency, a two-way lock-in emerges: the foil not only synchronizes with the\ncylinder shedding but also modulates it, accelerating the wake and enhancing\nlift.Flexibility is found to be detrimental in fully immersed wakes but\nbeneficial in partial wakes, where it creates extra suction without much extra\ndrag in the semi-wake-flexible mode. These findings elucidate the energy-saving\nand maneuverability strategies employed by biological propulsors and provide\npredictive guidelines for the design of bio-inspired energy harvesters and\nunmanned vehicles in disturbed flows."}

While existing models have\nsuccessfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often\nassume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption\nbreaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where\nthe solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here,\nwe investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt,\nand a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe\nthe formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water\nevaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence\non ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models\ncannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is\ngoverned by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation\nrate.

The initial\nvorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively\ndistinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors. Tracer particle\ntrajectories are computed in the fluid field obtained using the Eulerian\nframework, with transport and mixing quantified using statistical measures such\nas absolute dispersion, position probability distribution functions (PDFs), and\nvelocity PDFs. In the early stages, the onset of turbulence is primarily\ngoverned by the instability growth rate, which increases with vorticity packing\nfraction. As the flow evolves, transport exhibits a range of\nbehaviors-subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive-and transitions between\nanisotropic and isotropic regimes, depending on the initial vorticity packing,\nflow structure, and stage of evolution. At later times, transport is dominated\nby the motion of large-scale coherent vortices, whose dynamics are also\ninfluenced by the initial vorticity packing ranging from subdiffusive trapping\nrotational motion and random walks, and L\\'evy flight-like events. These\nfindings offer insights into transport in quasi-2D systems-ranging from\nlaboratory-scale flows to geophysical phenomena and astrophysical\nstructures-through analogies with 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence."}

The hemivariational inequality provides the weak\nformulation of a stationary incompressible fluid flow through a porous medium,\ngoverned by the CBFeD equations, which account for convection, damping, and\nnonlinear resistance effects. The problem incorporates a non-leak boundary\ncondition and a subdifferential friction-type condition. We first analyze the\nstability of solutions with respect to perturbations in the external force\ndensity and the superpotential. Next, we prove the existence of a solution to\nthe optimal control problem, where the external force density acts as the\ncontrol variable. We then propose a numerical scheme for solving the optimal\ncontrol problem and establish its convergence. For concreteness, the numerical\nmethod is implemented using finite element discretization. Finally, we provide\nsome numerical examples to validate the theory developed."}

Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by\nreplacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions\ndefined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.\nWhile CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the\nsingle-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)\nconventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and\n(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating\ncentralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in\nturn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL\nframework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate\nHJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its\ndifferential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by\nintroducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines\nvalue gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn\nyielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our\nmethod using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including\nmulti-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time\nRL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics."}

Existing detection approaches,\nsuch as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not\naddress the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,\nwhere responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore\npresent MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,\nunsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor\naccess to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes\ndomains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into\natomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using\nsynonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the\nretrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms\ncontradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a\nresponse-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG\nlocalizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,\npregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),\nallowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure\nthresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a\nproprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for\ndetecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based\nconversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that\ntranslates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this\ndesign is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments."}

We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks."}

Geostatistics leverages\nthe spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the\nrelationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We\npropose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through\nengineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this\napproach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of\nregression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,\nclay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and\nin-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable\nuncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several\nother spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as\nwell as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random\nforest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%\ncompared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This\nimprovement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN\nalgorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR\nfeatures. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small\nsample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for\nweak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal\nsoil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a\nvery robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in\nprecision agriculture."}

Both signals serve as an exploration bonus\nwithin the RLVR framework to guide the model.

Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments\ndemonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding\nbenchmarks.

In this paper, we\nidentify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude\nof policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to\ninefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially\ndestabilizes large updates for uncertain ones.

We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that\nare valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no\nmore than necessary.

A few attempts have been made in recent years to\njointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world\napplications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,\nthe target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,\nwith low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal\nresults in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a\nsemantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution\nmethod. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional\ngeneration problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity\nsensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal\nfeature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as\npure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract\nthe global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source\nimages and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising\nprocess via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at\nmultiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with\ncross-modal features and abundant semantic information.

Despite the limited data quality and quantity,\nour approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80\nfor Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding\nNon-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH).

However, this\ntask remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without\npre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nand practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga\nline art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this\nproblem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a\nTransformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and\nacross images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching\nalgorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level\ncorrespondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic\nannotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct\nbenchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates\nconsistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for\nreal-world manga applications."}

We study this limitation\nthrough visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in\nimages, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be\ninferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail\non visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the\ntask into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting\nis the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe\nthat composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,\nhighlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation\ncomplexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.\nThese findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future\nimprovements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning."}

In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in\nintegrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables\nflexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.\nTherefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial\nIntelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,\nwe first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in\ncomputational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational\nframework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core\nbiological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired\nmultimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric\nconversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.\nTogether, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial\nreasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we\nconduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their\nrelevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the\ndevelopment of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further\nexamine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application\ndomains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we\noutline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that\ncan generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.\nWe hope this work will benefit the research community with a\nneuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway.

However, their substantial\ncomputational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in\nresource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free\nframework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to\njointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the\nselection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian\nprocess-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal\nconfigurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application\nrequirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant\nreductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy\nacross a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional\nresults highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging\naggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism\nto trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand.

We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing\nsophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous\nconvection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression\nTasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric\nforecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields\noptimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs\ndual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,\nphysically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present\nfour key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap\nacross multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the \"IVT Paradox\", removing\nIntegrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric\nriver analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)\narchitectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART\nachieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent\nCSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding\ndisaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to\nsystematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,\nwith no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our\nvalidation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently\ndemonstrates DART's specialized design.

Most existing\nunsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable\ncross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these\nmethods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node\ndistinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the\nmisalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature\nheterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node\ncorrespondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that\nsimultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency\nacross latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines\nlow-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both\nstructure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space\nmisalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns\nbijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring\nconsistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive\nexperiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior\nrobustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.\nAdditionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using\ndiverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes\nbeyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language\nrepresentations."}
