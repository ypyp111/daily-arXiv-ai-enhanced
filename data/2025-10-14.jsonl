This results in sharp gradients in the surfactant\nconcentration on the interface and also between the two phases in the bulk when\nthere is selective adsorption/desorption, presenting a serious challenge for\nthe numerical simulations.\n  To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational model for the\ntransport of soluble surfactants that can model the adsorption and desorption\nprocesses accurately. The model is discretized using a central-difference\nscheme, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation that is crucial for the\nsimulation of turbulent flows. The model is used with the ACDI\ndiffuse-interface method (Jain, 2022), but can also be used with other\nalgebraic-based interface-capturing methods.

As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user\nmemory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.\nWe investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language\nmodels (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence\ntests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles\nproduce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated\nuser independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic\nbiases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles\nreceived more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate\nsignificant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and\nsupportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms\ncan embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning.

While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by\nreusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by\ndisaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be\nrealized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM\ninference engines and queries.\n  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV\ncaching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM\nengines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.\nLMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming\nLLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV\ncache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both\ncache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode\ndisaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and\nwide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache\ndata movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement\noperations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,\ndecoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class\ncontrol API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for\nflexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.\nEvaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x\nimprovement in throughput across diverse workloads.

We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem.

In order to identify cell instances\nfrom foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose\ninstance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to\nforeground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the\ncenter point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the\ncenter point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped\npolygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric\nproperties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,\nwhich require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,\nwe present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),\nto leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into\ncell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic\nsegmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries\nwith a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary\nfeature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling\npixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the\nneighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is\nused to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary\nsignature.

However, these blending approaches inevitably\nintroduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to\ndifferent model training recipes, while human perception is particularly\nsensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the\nportrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a\nsingle-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and\nupscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our\nmodel on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision\nmechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then\nintegrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,\nreducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration.

In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a\nPerturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to\nsystematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three\nkey insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting\nthese critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion\nneurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders\nof magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but\ntend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\\_proj\ncomponents; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,\nrather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and\nscales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications\nfor LLM robustness and interpretability.

Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we\nregard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set\nrepresents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce\na new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity\nbetween two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs\nbased on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural\nproperties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the\npositive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a\ncorrection scheme is provided.

The\nContradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,\nproposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical\ninference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential\nresolution.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\ngame-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the\nuplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user\nequipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),\ncapturing the network's natural hierarchical structure.

Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity\nconsistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial\ncontrollability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose\nReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It\nconstitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix\nModule leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic\nfeatures of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT\nbackbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,\npixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address\nthis, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues\nfrom reference images and introduces an {\\epsilon}-equivariant latent space\nthat jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise\nspace. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where\nenvironmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature\nalignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while\npreserving identity.

To better utilize the full surface and interior of\nthe object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and\nback surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process\ncreates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose\nestimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.\nAdditionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to\nprovide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface\ncoordinates.

To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel\nend-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D\nrepresentations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of\nboth modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features\nfrom 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based\ngait features.

Under this framework, an Expert\nSignature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a\nunique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently\ngenerates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method\nachieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%\nand 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal\ninstead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and\ntrustworthy AI systems for healthcare."}

Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11\nclosed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge\nexcellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training\nstrategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation\nalone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a \"Turing Test for\njudges\" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark\nfor classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different\nevaluation needs."}

This method provides numerous benefits,\nincluding fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed\nto zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training\nin such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information\nretrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text\ninstance is \"similar\" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label\nis determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art\nsentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text\ninstance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary\nclassification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon\nprevious literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and\nevaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based\nclassification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the\nsemantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,\nand label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic\nmulti-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity\ndistributions show statistically significant differences across models,\ndatasets and even label sets.

Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly\nemerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of\nbetter data efficiency and free of the \"reversal curse\" in pre-training.\nHowever, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training\nphase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through\nfine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,\nevaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to\nprobe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that\narLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA\ngeneralization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order\nmatches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward\nand backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal\ngains.

In recent years, research in image enhancement has\nproven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor\ngeneralization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges\nherein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these\ndatasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact\nthat limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In\nthis paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On\none hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model\nto include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and\nclose-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using\nControlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,\nand hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.\n  Tags - Underwater Images, Denoising Diffusion, Marine ecosystem, Controlnet"}

Modeling the\nagent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show\nthat accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \\emph{structural constraints} --\nequivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)\n\\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved\nquantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines\ntrajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds\nmove but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds\naligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a\ngeometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models.

Existing studies often treat utility as a generic\nattribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from\nthe same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension\nability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments.

Training very deep\narchitectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted\ncomputation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which\nin turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.\nTo address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which\nprovide a balance between model depth and task complexity.

Existing KV\ncache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires\nidentical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct\nprecomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and\nrepeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially\naddress these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This\npaper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and\nhigh generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit\nsimilar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model\nfor generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for\nrestoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response\nquality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:\n(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache\nrecomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection\naccuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)\ngrouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.\nExperiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention\nperformance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%\nand 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%).

However, most fusion strategies are applied\nuniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We\nargue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide\nbenefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we\nreframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show\nthat performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each\nexcelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage\nthis finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and\nContext-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's\nprediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive\nper-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are\nnon-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective\nthat compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the\nGNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance\nacross node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up\nto $+13\\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance.

In view of this, we first present a comprehensive\nevaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then\nintroduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the\nrobustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:\n(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded\ncategories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,\ncategory-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)\napplying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting\nMechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment\ncategories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our\nmethod maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing\nrobustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations."}

Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background\ninformation that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such\nhidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to\ndistinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore\nwhether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify\ndataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images.

Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,\nnot necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were\ntested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid\ndatasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,\nnon-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,\nmaking classification more challenging. The second method involves the\napplication of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,\nand Median filter, and their combinations.

Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the\ngeneration process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit\nconstraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this\nhuman-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while\nreducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward\ntrustworthy reasoning."}

Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or\nimage translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or\nintroduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address\nthis, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a\nnovel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer\nfrom model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD\nmodels. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality\ngap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation\nfails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To\novercome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a\nbidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a\nconnection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich\nRGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by\nfeeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head.

However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data.

We show that our scoring strategies capture\ndifferent classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled\nretrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis\nsystems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic\npaths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we\ncompare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends\nin drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly\napplicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.\nBy releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,\nwe hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis."}

To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel\nsemantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,\ndubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a\nnew textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,\ndepicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality.

While existing methods\napproximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via\ncustomized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all\nMC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms\nin the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint\nrestricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations\nand ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose \\emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient\nRL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the\nELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key\nproperties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term\ndepends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation\nacross samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the\nvalue and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based\nobjective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for\nthe original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC\nsample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved\nRL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.\nExperiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for\ndLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks."}

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision.

When applied to real-world\ndownstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data\nand out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection. Furthermore, {\\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD\ngeneralization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound\nmaximization for {\\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to\nnot only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,\nwhich serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization.

Under review at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,\nmulti-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,\niterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while\nfast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded\nperformance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this\ngap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,\nlies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including\ndiffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of\nlearning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer\ndesign space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative\nTrajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns\nthe entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical\nfor offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled\nadaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative\npolicies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks."}

To facilitate future research, we make our\ndatasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT."}
