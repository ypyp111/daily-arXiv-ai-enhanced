Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented\nwith a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a\nCombined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network.

The\nAMD-IDDES approach incorporates an anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model\ninto the traditional IDDES framework to better account for local flow\nanisotropy and energy dissipation characteristics. The method is validated\nagainst the traditional IDDES approach, and the results show that AMD-IDDES\nmore accurately captures the evolution of vortices and separated shear layers.\nCompared with an iced straight wing, a swept wing exhibits distinct aerodynamic\nbehavior driven mainly by the sweep angle. The sweep angle induces strong\nspanwise flow, which reshapes the separation region and transforms the flow\nfrom two-dimensional to three-dimensional. This spanwise motion significantly\nalters vortex development and enhances the complexity of the unsteady flow. The\nshear layer separation, initiated by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, dominates\nthe unsteady aerodynamic response.

The fidelity and robustness of LES depends critically on the SGS\nmodel, particularly in coarse simulations where much of the turbulence spectrum\nremains unresolved.\n  In this work, we extend the tau-orthogonal (TO) method, a data-driven SGS\nmodeling framework, to three-dimensional turbulent flows. The method\nreformulates the high-dimensional SGS closure problem as a low-dimensional\nprediction task focused on scale-aware quantities of interest (QoIs). We extend\nthe model to incorporate QoI-state dependence and temporal correlations by\ncombining regularized least-squares regression with a multivariate Gaussian\nresidual model. This yields a simple yet effective stochastic time-series\nprediction model (the LRS model), with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters\nthan typical deep learning approaches which try to directly learn the\nhigh-dimensional SGS closure.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TO LRS model in three-dimensional\nforced isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. The model achieves\naccurate long-term QoI distributions, robust performance across hyperparameter\nsettings, and good reproduction of key flow features such as kinetic energy\nspectra and coherent structures, despite being trained solely on QoI\ntrajectories. Comparisons against classical SGS models, including Smagorinsky\nand WALE formulations, highlight the TO LRS model's balance of accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency."}

This survey offers\na comprehensive review of feed-forward techniques for 3D reconstruction and\nview synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation\narchitectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural\nRadiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free\nreconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video\nsynthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics,\nand beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed\nstatistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We\nconclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for\nfuture work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance\nthe state of the art in 3D vision."}

The\n  theory addresses both the stability of the method and provides error\n  estimates for two different approximation methods. A Kansa-like\n  matrix is obtained by replacing the test point set $X$, used in the\n  traditional Kansa method, by a larger set $Y$, which is a norming\n  set for the underlying trial space. This gives rise to a rectangular\n  matrix.

Finally, two\n  different types of error estimates are given. Discrete least squares\n  estimates of very high accuracy are obtained for solutions that are\n  sufficiently smooth.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points.

Therefore, the\nproposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art\nregression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -\nproviding comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than\nproviding ratings or categorical labels."}

This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models.

Current 3D\nscene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,\nparticularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles\nand interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and\npowerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects\nusing natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D\nembeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that\ncaptures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These\nrelational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level\nintegration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for\nunified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and\nquestion answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional\nsupervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,\nMulti3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms\nstrong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided\nrelational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes."}

Various scientific and engineering applications demand a\nversatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions\nwith adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and\nspecialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for\nsolving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model\nfor two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1\nmodel, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational\ngraph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The\nmesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary\nspatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to\npretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs\nwith different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of\nvariables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for\nPDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs,\nPDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has\nsmaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2\ncan be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable\nnature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover\ncoefficient scalars and fields of a PDE."}

An Analysis of Simple Test-Time Scaling", "comment": null, "summary": "Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this\nscaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually\ncontrolling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum\nlength or scaling up by iteratively appending \"Wait\" when the model is about to\nterminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower\nupper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the\ntest-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,\nit is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to\nunlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --\nrather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior."}

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces.

To address this class of failures, we introduce the\nQorvex Security AI Framework for Behavioral & Cognitive Resilience (QSAF Domain\n10), a lifecycle-aware defense framework defined by a six-stage cognitive\ndegradation lifecycle. The framework includes seven runtime controls\n(QSAF-BC-001 to BC-007) that monitor agent subsystems in real time and trigger\nproactive mitigation through fallback routing, starvation detection, and memory\nintegrity enforcement. Drawing from cognitive neuroscience, we map agentic\narchitectures to human analogs, enabling early detection of fatigue,\nstarvation, and role collapse. By introducing a formal lifecycle and real-time\nmitigation controls, this work establishes Cognitive Degradation as a critical\nnew class of AI system vulnerability and proposes the first cross-platform\ndefense model for resilient agentic behavior."}

Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}).

Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world\nscenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared\nto state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike\nconventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy\ncomputation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image\nand a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,\nreduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for\napplications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion\ntrajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity."}

Supervised learning methods rely on\ndense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised\napproaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and\nphotometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is\ncostly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised\nmethods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only\nsparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training.

Probing\nrepresentations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where\nyears evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal\norientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we\nfound that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear\ntemporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal\nconstruction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for\nunderstanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a\nsubjective construction of the external world by its internal representational\nsystem. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien\ncognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a\ndirection for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

Traditional\npredictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that\nfail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced\nintegration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer\nbetter accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented\nwith a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a\nCombined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset\nincluded behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.\nExperiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream\ncombinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and\ncoefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and\nLinear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985\nvs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed\nsigns of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,\nwhile the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when\nintegrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF),\nunderscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear\ninteractions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion\noffers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with\nmultimodal mental health data.

Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize.

To disentangle\nhighly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank\nregularization during training. We also release Time-HD, a benchmark of large,\ndiverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting\ncross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD\ndemonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and\nefficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF\nresearch."}

We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how\nidentity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five\ndifferent high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,\npolitics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are\nextremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,\ngender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For\ninstance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different\nstandards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same\nsymptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a\nconservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by\nolder (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for\nnon-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men.

This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA\n(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token\ncompression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that\naggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,\ninspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are\nforwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length\nand computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that\nTCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing\ntraining resource consumption by a substantial margin."}

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show\nthat our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on\nHICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/ChelsieLei/HOLa."}

A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for\nmultiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,\nresembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth\nobservation satellites.

This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg).

Existing tools for CXR\ninterpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture\ntemporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision\nencoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through\ninterpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at\neach hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a\nretrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy\nin forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became\nradiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds\nsignificant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions\nlike acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial\nand diagnoses are often delayed.

Motivated by this insight, we propose\naligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,\nencouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily\ncorrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer\n(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images\nfrom latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer\nconsistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative\ngenerative models.

To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static\ntransformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to\nsequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding\ntime-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend\nequivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie\nsubgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.\nWe begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:\ntheir hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for\nmoving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and\ndemonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant\ncounterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity\ngeneralization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We\npresent this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect\nthe time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us."}

This paper\nexplores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation\nof satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for\nmultiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,\nresembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth\nobservation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes\nwith classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability,\nand generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the\nautonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques.

This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images.

To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

Biomolecules within plants serve as key\nstress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and\nearly disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive\nmeans to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational\nsignatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized\ndata-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and\nprior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases\nand inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation\nof Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated\nworkflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches,\nDIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without\nmanual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features\nin an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,\nincluding abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic\nstressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational\nspectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment,\nfostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices."}

This\nhas raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced,\nhuman-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This\npaper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and\ngeneralizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We\nconduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of\nprominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for\ngeneralization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that\nsmall LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on\nin-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM\ntasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nprolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of\nthe training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain\ndata but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks.\nThis suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than\nthe acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability."}

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,\nConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and\nhelps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in."}

This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations.
