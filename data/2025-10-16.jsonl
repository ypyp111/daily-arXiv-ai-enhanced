In\nthis position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human\npluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI\nsystems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and\noutline actionable steps towards it."}

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR\nconsistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch\nfrom preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,\nrequiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies."}

In\nthis work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\\textsuperscript{2}FM),\na unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first\nlearns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a\nshared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third\nmode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary\nreasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To\njointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy\nOptimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a\ncost-regularized reward.

To solve this problem, we then propose a novel\napproach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),\nwhich progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game\nequilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a\nmore optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a\nsuboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and\ntwo synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance\nimprovements over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

We\nintroduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that\ninserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge\nthe distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used\nfor drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across\nmodels, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly\nsmaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds\non fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each\nstage, improving throughput.

While\nrecent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,\nthese models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario\ndata, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from\ndifferent geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment\noften struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological\nconditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising\nperformance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization\nTest-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess\nintrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,\nwhich remain consistent across different regions regardless of external\nconditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for\nguiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust\nparameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance\nin new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.\nSpecifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic\ncharacteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the\nmodel during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to\nadapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses\nderived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order\nvariation.

Our\nanalysis reveals three critical phenomena: \"Cross-Lingual Value Shifts\" where\nidentical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,\n\"Reasoning-Induced Degradation\" where prompting models to explain their\nreasoning worsens cultural alignment, and \"Logit Leakage\" where models refuse\nsensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden\npreferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic\nlinguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse\nnations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for\ndiagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and\nmethodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI."}

While digital technologies promise unprecedented\naccess to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to\nachieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review\ninvestigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic\nresearch, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past\ntwo decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing\napproaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,\nwhich prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and\nare plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide\ndiagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we\nargue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric\ncomputational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic\ntext and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust\nevaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on\ncanonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on\nstatistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets.

In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the\nprinciple of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under\nsingle-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a\nmatching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.\n  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the\nproblem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP.

While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed\nto mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual\naugmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,\nlimiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free\ndecoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key\ncontributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the\nintrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the\nquery and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm\nthat adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,\nutilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments\nacross four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding\nsignificantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art\ndecoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating\nquery-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective\ngeneration of LVLMs."}

In\ncontrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D\nbreast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method\nrequires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used\nwith any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of\nour pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion\npipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically\ncorrect surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed\nimplicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural\nrepresentations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which\nemploys a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --\ninspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit\nbreast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural\nSDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our\nsurface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for\nlocalized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of\nreconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its\nglobal counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to\nrecover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2\nmm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and\nopen-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at\nhttps://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit."}

We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson\nsampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by\ndirectly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum\nreward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the\nprior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and\nincrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a\nnovel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that\nmatches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals\nthe critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of\nmaximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we\nvalidate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally\nstable protein search, and quantum circuit design.

Graphics Processing\nUnits (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,\nand feature detection and SLAM in particular.\n  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable\nGate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first\nstudy of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM\n(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated\nFAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated\ncounterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).\n  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector\nsuch as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated\nV-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the\nFAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.\nHowever, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its\nFPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy\nefficiency (up to 3.1$\\times$ and 1.4$\\times$ improvements, respectively) than\nthe GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable\nrun-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in\n2 out of 5 dataset sequences.

However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial\nlimitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,\nwhich constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,\nespecially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that\ntrainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token\nselection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading\nwithout altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent\nlocality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer\nof selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall\ndecoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse\nattention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA\nintroduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into\nquery-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while\npreserving the same attention computation as used during training.

Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable\nmodels that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints\nand a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in\nlow-data or few-shot learning scenarios.

A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)\nproperty, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In\npractice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally\nexpensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose\ndimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS\nexpression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis\nhave been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented\nalgorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer\nmodel that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,\nthereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall\nmethodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset\ngeneration of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the\ncorresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to\nensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically.

To address this limitation,\nwe propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation\nmodels to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset\nprior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level\nediting via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D\nreconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,\nEditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies\nconsistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward\nreconstruction without requiring costly refinement.

While prior work has shown that\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,\nSFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To\naddress this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a\nnovel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned\nexception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides\nthe model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,\nclassifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final\ndecision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced\njudgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents."}

A central challenge in this setting lies in\nutilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment\nwith the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual\nConditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs\nthe CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous\nframes. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively\nrestricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the\ndiffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when\nbeneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant\ninformation. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy\ndataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision\nand semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate\nthat AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity\ncompared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior\nvisuals conflict with the current input."}

In order to improve the\nrobustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various\nadversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work\nconsidered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the\nrecipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of\nadversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion\ninformation-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the\ntransition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very\nlimited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during\nthe training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient\nagent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on\nstate-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms.

Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task\nwhere the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the\ninput image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative\npositions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise\nPhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to\ninject physical knowledge into the video generation process.

Despite this progress, their adversarial\nrobustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial\npatch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first\nintroduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic\nadversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the\ncamera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these\npatches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual\nlatent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent\nrepresentations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.\nThrough the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's\ninterpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate\nincorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given\nrobotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for\nthe visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent\nrepresentations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.\nExtensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation\nbenchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate\nof cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates\nthis degradation.

The investigation is conducted\nthrough four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several\nanalyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral\nanalysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis\nwith PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual\ninformation are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a\n2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to\nperforming spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning\na spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,\nPLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean\ncontent of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.\nModeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is\nlimited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.\nTherefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat\ncontent in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and\npixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN\naugmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with\nPLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by\nanalyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results\nwere inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,\nthis thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages.

This\nwork positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal\nlogic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a\nmechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads\nbetween locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that\nlocally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating\nphrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad\ndownstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:\n1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward\nattention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which\nquantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives\nfrom subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring\npreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range\ncontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately\nfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent\nreasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies\nthat dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan\ntokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent\nperformance gains across various reasoning tasks.
