### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA是一个大规模视觉-语言-动作模型，采用双级动作表示框架和混合训练策略，在机器人操作任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视觉-语言-动作模型在机器人操作任务中的表示对齐问题，提出了一种能够同时捕捉高层意图和低层动态的动作表示方法。

Method: 使用潜在动作模型和结构化离散动作令牌的双级监督框架，结合机器人轨迹数据与通用QA数据集进行混合训练。

Result: 在LIBERO Franka基准测试中表现优越，在真实世界多样化操作任务中达到竞争性成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效对齐了语言、视觉和动作的表示空间，使VLM能够直接参与动作生成，为机器人操作任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了基础模型在胎儿超声影像中低类间变异条件下的表现，发现领域自适应预训练对于区分解剖结构相似的胎儿脑部标准切面至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然DINOv3等视觉基础模型在医学领域展现了良好的迁移能力，但其在解剖结构相似情况下的区分能力尚未得到系统研究。本研究针对胎儿脑部标准切面（TT、TV、TC）这一具有高度重叠解剖特征的关键挑战进行深入分析。

Method: 收集并整合所有公开胎儿超声数据集，构建包含18.8万张标注图像的FetalUS-188K多中心基准。采用自监督方式预训练DINOv3学习超声感知表示，通过线性探测和全微调等标准化适应协议进行评估，比较胎儿超声数据预训练和自然图像初始化两种方案。

Result: 胎儿超声数据预训练的模型始终优于自然图像初始化的模型，加权F1分数提升高达20%。领域自适应预训练使网络能够保留区分中间切面（如TV）所需的细微回声和结构线索。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型在低类间变异条件下无法良好泛化，而领域特定预训练对于在胎儿脑部超声成像中获得稳健且临床可靠的表示至关重要。

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) 与传统U-Net模型在洪水淹没制图中的系统比较显示，GFMs在精度、计算效率和少样本学习方面具有优势，其中Clay模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GFMs在从卫星图像中提取时空信息方面具有潜力，但目前尚不清楚它们是否优于传统模型如U-Net，且缺乏跨传感器和数据可用性场景的系统比较。

Method: 评估了三种GFMs（Prithvi 2.0、Clay V1.5、DOFA）和UViT，与TransNorm、U-Net和Attention U-Net进行比较，使用PlanetScope、Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2数据，并进行了跨区域交叉验证和少样本实验。

Result: Clay在PlanetScope（0.79 mIoU）和Sentinel-2（0.70）上表现最佳，Prithvi在Sentinel-1（0.57）上领先。在跨区域验证中，Clay在所有传感器上表现略优，少样本实验中Clay仅用5张训练图像就达到0.64 mIoU。Clay模型更小（26M参数），计算速度比Prithvi快3倍，比DOFA快2倍。

Conclusion: GFMs在洪水制图精度上提供了小幅到中等的改进，同时具有更低的计算成本和标注工作量，与传统U-Net相比是更好的选择，特别是Clay模型在性能和效率方面表现突出。

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于学习框架的图像重建方法，适用于上采样和修复任务，能够在固定确定性采样模式下实现与全监督方法相当的性能，且需要更少的地面真实数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要完整的地面真实数据，而自监督方法通常依赖随机采样。本文针对固定确定性采样模式（即使期望值也无法覆盖完整图像）的问题，探索利用图像分布的多种不变性来克服这一限制。

Method: 利用底层图像分布的多种不变性，在固定确定性采样模式下进行图像重建，理论上能够达到与全监督方法相同的重建性能。

Result: 在光分辨率图像上采样（光声显微镜PAM）任务中验证，展示了具有竞争力或更优的结果，同时需要显著减少的地面真实数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在固定采样模式下实现高质量图像重建，减少了对完整地面真实数据的依赖，为图像重建任务提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了三种大型多模态模型在医疗影像中检测受保护健康信息的性能，发现LMM在OCR准确率上优于传统方法，但OCR性能提升并不总能转化为更好的整体PHI检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PHI检测方法主要依赖OCR和命名实体识别，而新兴的大型多模态模型为改进文本提取和语义分析提供了新机会。

Method: 系统评估GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Qwen 2.5 7B三种LMM，采用两种流程配置：纯文本分析和OCR+语义分析集成。

Result: LMM在OCR效果上显著优于EasyOCR等传统模型（WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03），但在复杂印记模式场景中表现最佳。当文本区域可读性好且使用强LMM时，不同流程配置结果相似。

Conclusion: LMM在OCR方面有优势，但PHI检测效果提升有限；提供了基于实际约束的LMM选择建议和可扩展的模块化部署策略。

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [6] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrengthSense是一个包含11种力量需求活动和2种非力量需求活动的IMU传感器开放数据集，用于推进人类活动识别算法和健康监测应用的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏捕捉力量需求活动的全面数据集，而使用IMU等可穿戴传感器跟踪这些活动对于监测肌肉力量、耐力和力量至关重要。

Method: 从29名健康受试者收集数据，在肢体和躯干上放置10个IMU传感器，并使用视频记录作为参考进行标注。通过比较IMU估计的关节角度和视频直接提取的关节角度来验证数据准确性。

Result: 创建了一个包含13种活动的综合IMU数据集，并通过对比分析验证了传感器数据的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: StrengthSense数据集为研究人员和开发者提供了宝贵资源，可用于推进人类活动识别算法、健身和健康监测应用的开发。

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [7] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化合成文本视觉问答数据集的端到端流水线，能够基于场景文本生成忠实的问题-答案对，并随着场景文本数据的可用性而扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建大规模文本视觉问答数据库需要繁琐的人工标注，而随着处理视觉和语言模态的基础模型以及OCR系统的成熟，需要建立能够基于图像中的场景文本自动合成问答对的端到端流水线。

Method: 利用多个模型和算法的能力，包括OCR检测和识别（文本定位）、感兴趣区域检测、字幕生成和问题生成，将这些组件整合成一个连贯的流水线来自动化合成和验证问答对。

Result: 构建了包含约72K个问答对、基于约44K张图像的大规模文本视觉问答数据集，据我们所知，这是首个提出的自动合成和验证大规模文本视觉问答数据集的流水线。

Conclusion: 提出的流水线能够有效自动化合成文本视觉问答数据集，解决了人工标注的繁琐问题，为相关研究提供了大规模数据支持。

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发并临床评估了基于头戴式显示器的纯深度无标记增强现实配准系统，在小曲率解剖结构上实现手术导航，临床中位误差3-4毫米


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统AR导航需要标记物的问题，开发无标记配准系统，特别针对小曲率解剖结构在真实手术环境中的配准挑战

Method: 在HoloLens 2上，通过深度偏差校正、人工初始化引导、全局和局部配准，将手部追踪深度数据与CT皮肤网格对齐，并在手术中进行验证

Result: 临床验证显示：足部中位误差3.2毫米，耳朵4.3毫米，小腿5.3毫米；5毫米覆盖率分别为92-95%、84-90%、72-86%

Conclusion: 纯深度无标记AR系统在真实手术环境中达到3-4毫米中位误差，接近中等风险任务的临床误差阈值，提高了无标记AR导航的临床适用性

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个全自动的浮游有孔虫生长轨迹重建管道，结合实例分割和腔室排序算法，从CT扫描数据中自动重建三维生长轨迹，显著减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 浮游有孔虫是重要的环境指示生物，但其腔室生长轨迹分析依赖耗时且主观的人工分割，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 端到端管道，集成实例分割技术和专门的腔室排序算法，从高分辨率CT扫描中重建三维生长轨迹，评估多种分割方法。

Result: 在专家标注数据集上验证，管道显著减少人工工作量，保持生物学意义精度；腔室排序算法对分割误差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 建立了首个完全自动化和可重复的数字有孔虫生长分析管道，为大规模数据驱动的生态研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化路面裂缝宽度对于评估结构完整性和指导维护至关重要，但传统方法在复杂裂缝边界形态和快速测量需求方面存在局限。

Method: 三阶段级联框架：1) 使用现有算法进行裂缝分割生成二值图像；2) 通过PCA确定准平行裂缝的主方向轴；3) 使用RPCA提取不规则裂缝几何的主传播轴。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在计算效率和测量精度方面均优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: 提出的PCA-RPCA级联框架能够有效解决路面裂缝宽度测量的关键挑战，为路面状况评估提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Waseem Shariff,Cian Ryan,Joe Lemley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CNN的自适应偏置调节机制，通过动态调整事件相机的偏置设置来抑制25-500Hz范围内的闪烁效应，无需额外硬件或软件滤波器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机在不同环境中因光强快速变化产生的闪烁效应，提升其在各种光照条件下的性能表现。

Method: 使用简单的卷积神经网络在空间域识别闪烁实例，然后动态调整特定偏置来最小化闪烁影响。

Result: 在面部检测任务中，YOLO置信度显著提升，检测到面部的帧比例增加，平均梯度（闪烁指标）在良好光照下降低38.2%，低光照下降低53.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升事件相机在不利光照场景下的功能表现，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于解决Grounded Video QA任务的三阶段框架，通过引入触发时刻概念来精确定位目标对象最可见的帧，显著提升了HOTA得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GVQA任务需要强大的多模态模型来进行复杂的视频内容推理、视觉接地和对象跟踪，现有方法在这些方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：视频推理与问答、时空接地和跟踪，关键创新是使用CORTEX提示推导触发时刻来定位目标对象最可见帧。

Result: 在GVQA任务上获得0.4968的HOTA得分，相比去年获胜分数0.2704有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的基于触发时刻的三阶段框架有效解决了GVQA任务中的复杂推理和跟踪挑战，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于大语言模型的多模态融合生成模型，能够从血液生物标志物和MRI扫描合成淀粉样蛋白PET图像，用于阿尔茨海默病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病诊断依赖淀粉样蛋白PET成像，但成本高且可及性有限，需要寻找替代方法。

Method: 收集566名参与者的数据，开发语言增强生成模型，融合多模态信息合成PET图像，并在全自动诊断流程中评估。

Result: 合成PET图像质量高（SSIM=0.920），诊断一致性良好（准确率=0.80），基于合成PET的模型（AUC=0.78）优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 语言增强生成模型能合成逼真PET图像，提升MRI和血液生物标志物在阿尔茨海默病诊断中的实用性。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了首个自动化管道autoStrain，使用深度学习技术自动估计经食管超声心动图(TEE)中的节段纵向应变(SLS)。比较了两种DL方法：基于RAFT光流模型的TeeFlow和基于CoTracker点轨迹模型的TeeTracker。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前应变估计技术需要大量人工干预和专业知识，限制了效率，使其在监测目的上过于资源密集。需要自动化解决方案来提高心脏功能评估的精度和效率。

Method: 使用SIMUS模拟管道生成高度逼真的合成TEE数据集(80名患者)，包含真实心肌运动数据。比较两种DL方法：TeeFlow(密集帧间预测)和TeeTracker(稀疏长序列预测)。

Result: TeeTracker在准确性上优于TeeFlow，在synTEE测试数据集上的运动估计平均距离误差为0.65 mm。临床验证显示SLS估计与临床参考值一致，平均差异为1.09%。

Conclusion: 将AI驱动的运动估计与TEE结合可以显著提高临床环境中心脏功能评估的精度和效率。

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将基础模型集成到移动稀疏感知系统中的前景和面临的开放挑战。

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断至关重要，现有多模态融合方法主要关注跨模态互补性而忽视了模态特异性特征的重要性，且模态间的分布差异会导致有偏和噪声表示，影响分类性能。

Method: 提出协作注意力和一致性引导融合框架，包括可学习参数表示块来补偿缺失模态信息，共享编码器和模态独立编码器来保留共享和特定表示，以及一致性引导机制来显式对齐跨模态的潜在分布。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效整合多模态特征并解决模态间分布差异问题，为阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断提供了更准确的多模态融合方法。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Motivation: 在手术场景中从内窥镜相机获取绝对深度很困难，限制了在真实内窥镜图像上进行监督学习的深度估计。现有的图像级无监督域适应方法在真实图像和翻译的合成图像之间仍存在域差距。

Method: 使用潜在特征对齐方法，通过对抗学习和方向特征一致性学习域不变特征。该方法与图像翻译过程无关，专注于深度估计本身。

Conclusion: 提出的潜在特征对齐方法有效减少了域差距，显著提高了内窥镜场景中的绝对深度估计性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Method: HTSC-CIF框架采用分层任务分解：低层任务对齐医学实体特征与空间位置；中层任务使用前缀语言建模和掩码图像建模增强跨模态对齐；高层任务通过前门干预的跨模态因果干预模块减少混杂因素。

Conclusion: HTSC-CIF框架通过分层任务分解成功解决了医学报告生成的三个关键挑战，在性能上超越了现有最佳方法。

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 物体姿态估计在3D计算机视觉中至关重要。虽然单点估计通常足够，但在传感器限制、投影约束或物体对称性导致姿态不明确的情况下，概率姿态输出具有诸多优势。

Conclusion: 欧拉角参数化在姿态估计中具有实用价值，特别是在构建归一化流模型时，能够提供比复杂参数化方法更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Motivation: 开发一个鲁棒且全局的相机位姿估计框架，避免传统方法对束调整的依赖，通过循环一致性实现更强的恢复保证。

Method: 改进消息传递最小二乘法，重新定义循环一致性使用迭代估计的距离，引入Welsch型鲁棒损失，集成基于鲁棒子空间恢复的异常值剔除模块。

Result: 建立了最强的确定性精确恢复保证，仅凭循环一致性就达到了目前已知的最低样本复杂度，在实验中持续优于包括带束调整的完整SfM流程在内的领先位姿估计器。

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync提供了一个无需束调整的全局相机位姿估计解决方案，通过循环一致性实现了优越的性能和理论保证。

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Motivation: 现有方法受限于仅基于结果的监督（只奖励正确答案而不确保推理质量）和统一的思考策略（在简单任务上过度思考，在复杂任务上思考不足）。

Method: 采用双奖励系统：思考奖励（评估推理质量的事实基础、逻辑一致性和答案一致性）和判断奖励（自适应决定深度推理还是直接回答更合适）。

Result: 在SAIL-VL2上的实验表明，SAIL-RL在4B和8B规模上都提升了推理和多模态理解基准性能，达到与GPT-4o等商业闭源模型竞争的水平，并显著减少幻觉。

Conclusion: SAIL-RL为构建更可靠和自适应的多模态大语言模型提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then

TL;DR: 提出GAFD-CC方法，通过全局感知特征解耦和置信度校准来改进OOD检测，利用特征与logits的关联性提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理OOD检测方法通常忽略特征与logits之间的内在关联，这限制了检测效果，需要更有效的方法来利用这种关联。

Method: GAFD-CC首先进行全局感知特征解耦，提取正相关和负相关特征；然后自适应融合解耦特征与多尺度logit置信度进行综合OOD检测。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，GAFD-CC展现出竞争性性能和强大的泛化能力，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GAFD-CC通过有效利用特征与logits的关联性，显著提升了OOD检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography

simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants

further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in

*Jizheng Ma,Xiaofei Zhou,Yanlong Song,Han Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa是一个新颖的视觉语言模型框架，通过连续跨模态推理来解决传统VLM在离散语言空间推理的局限性，使用潜在思维向量链进行迭代推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类认知中存在许多难以用语言表达的思维过程，而当前视觉语言模型被限制在离散的语言标记空间中推理，限制了视觉感知的丰富性。

Method: 提出CoCoVa框架，核心是迭代推理循环，使用Latent Q-Former作为动态推理引擎，通过跨模态融合迭代优化潜在思维向量链，结合对比学习和扩散重建的多任务目标训练。

Result: CoCoVa在准确性和标记效率上优于强基线，1.5B骨干模型在几乎所有基准测试中与7B-9B模型竞争或超越，7B骨干模型与最先进模型保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CoCoVa通过连续潜在空间推理成功弥合了离散语言处理与连续视觉理解之间的表征差距，学习到的潜在空间捕获了可解释的结构化推理模式。

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

TL;DR: RxnCaption框架将化学反应图解析重新定义为图像描述问题，使用BIVP策略和MolYOLO分子检测器在输入图像上预绘分子边界框和索引，显著提升结构提取质量并简化模型设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学反应数据多以论文中的图像形式存在，无法被机器读取，无法用于训练机器学习模型。

Method: 提出RxnCaption框架，将传统的坐标预测驱动解析过程重新表述为图像描述问题，采用BIVP策略使用MolYOLO分子检测器预绘分子边界框和索引。

Result: 构建了RxnCaption-11k数据集，比现有真实文献基准大一个数量级，RxnCaption-VL在多个指标上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法、数据集和模型将推动从化学文献中提取结构化信息，并催化化学领域更广泛的AI应用。

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于稀疏噪声雷达点云的自监督移动物体分割方法，通过对比学习和聚类损失函数来减少对标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达传感器能直接测量多普勒速度，适合单次扫描的移动物体分割，但雷达点云稀疏且噪声大，数据标注成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用基于聚类的对比自监督表示学习，通过动态点去除进行聚类优化；然后使用少量标注数据进行监督微调。

Result: 该方法提高了标签效率，通过自监督预训练有效提升了最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练方法能够显著减少对标注数据的依赖，在稀疏噪声雷达点云的移动物体分割任务中取得了良好效果。

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分组的混合颜色校正算法，通过估计重叠率将目标点云自适应分组，并针对不同组别采用不同的颜色校正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 彩色点云的颜色一致性校正是3D渲染和压缩应用中的基础任务，现有方法主要针对彩色图像，需要专门针对彩色点云的校正算法。

Method: 算法首先估计源点云和目标点云的重叠率，然后自适应地将目标点分为2-3组（近距离、中距离、远距离组）。针对不同组别：近距离组使用K近邻双边插值(KBI)，中距离组使用联合KBI和直方图均衡化(JKHE)，远距离组使用直方图均衡化(HE)。

Result: 在1086个测试彩色点云对上验证了算法的有效性，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该算法通过自适应分组和混合校正策略，实现了有效的彩色点云颜色一致性校正，具有分组效应自由特性。

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过比较猫与人类视觉系统的表征对齐，发现自监督ViT模型在跨物种视觉表征对齐方面表现最佳，特别是在早期层，表明自监督学习能够产生桥接物种特异性统计特征的表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 猫和人类在眼部解剖结构上存在差异（猫有垂直瞳孔），但尚不清楚这种差异如何影响下游视觉表征。本研究旨在量化猫与人类跨物种视觉表征在自然场景中的对齐程度。

Method: 使用统一的冻结编码器基准测试，比较卷积网络、监督Vision Transformers、窗口化transformers和自监督ViTs（DINO）在不同层的表征对齐，采用中心核对齐（线性和RBF）和表征相似性分析等方法。

Result: DINO ViT-B/16模型获得最高的对齐度（平均CKA-RBF≈0.814，CKA-linear≈0.745，RSA≈0.698），在早期块达到峰值。监督ViTs在CKA上表现良好但几何对应较弱，CNNs作为强基线但低于普通ViTs，窗口化transformers表现最差。

Conclusion: 自监督学习与ViT归纳偏置相结合产生的表征几何比广泛使用的CNNs和窗口化Transformers更接近猫与人类视觉系统的对齐，为跨物种视觉计算收敛提供了可测试的神经科学假设。

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

TL;DR: IllumFlow是一个结合条件整流流和Retinex理论的低光照图像增强框架，通过分别优化光照和反射分量来处理光照变化和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照图像增强中光照变化范围广和噪声复杂的问题，传统方法难以同时有效处理这两个挑战。

Method: 基于Retinex理论分解图像为反射和光照分量，使用条件整流流框架建模光照变化，引入基于流的数据增强去噪网络处理反射分量噪声。

Result: 在低光照增强和曝光校正任务上，定量和定性评估均优于现有方法，实现了精确的光照适应和可定制的亮度增强。

Conclusion: IllumFlow通过结合整流流和Retinex理论，有效解决了低光照图像增强中的光照变化和噪声问题，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

Conclusion: MVAFormer通过保留空间信息的特征图和专门设计的transformer协作模块，成功解决了STAR设置下的多视角动作识别问题，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in

such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

*Xu Zhang,Danyang Li,Xiaohang Dong,Tianhao Wu,Hualong Yu,Jianye Wang,Qicheng Li,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniChange是一个基于多模态大语言模型的统一变化检测框架，首次将二进制变化检测和语义变化检测任务统一起来，通过特殊标记和文本提示实现多源数据集的知识获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前变化检测模型通常只能从单一类型标注数据中获取有限知识，无法同时利用多样化的BCD和SCD数据集，导致泛化能力差和功能有限。

Method: 利用MLLMs的语言先验和统一能力，引入三个特殊标记[T1]、[T2]和[CHANGE]，通过文本提示指导变化类别识别，无需预定义分类头。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中达到最先进性能，IoU得分分别为90.41、53.04、78.87和57.62，超越所有先前方法。

Conclusion: UniChange成功证明了MLLMs在统一变化检测任务中的潜力，能够有效从多源数据集中获取知识，即使类别定义存在冲突。

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

*Tao Liu,Kan Ren,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于目标检测和图像匹配的跨视角无人机定位框架，通过图神经网络处理异构图像间的匹配问题，在GNSS拒止环境下实现有效定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低空经济的发展，无人机在巡逻系统中测量和跟踪变得至关重要，但在GNSS拒止区域，基于卫星的定位方法容易失效，需要解决跨时间、跨视角、异构航空图像的匹配问题。

Method: 利用现代目标检测技术从无人机和卫星图像中准确提取显著实例，集成图神经网络推理图像间和图像内节点关系，采用细粒度的基于图的节点相似性度量方法。

Result: 在公开和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效处理异构外观差异，泛化能力强，适用于更大模态差距的场景（如红外-可见光图像匹配）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过目标检测和图神经网络的结合，实现了强健的检索和定位性能，为解决GNSS拒止环境下的无人机定位问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PtychoBench基准来比较监督微调(SFT)和上下文学习(ICL)在显微镜工作流程自动化中的效果，发现在视觉任务中SFT和ICL互补，而在文本任务中ICL表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基础模型在先进显微镜工作流程自动化中具有潜力，但如何为专业科学任务优化这些通用模型的最佳领域适应策略尚不明确。

Method: 引入PtychoBench多模态多任务基准，系统比较监督微调(SFT)和上下文学习(ICL)两种专业化策略，在数据稀缺情况下评估视觉伪影检测和文本参数推荐任务。

Result: 视觉任务中SFT和ICL高度互补，微调模型在上下文感知示例指导下达到最高性能(Micro-F1 0.728)；文本任务中ICL在大型基础模型上表现最优，达到Micro-F1 0.847，优于强大的监督微调模型。

Conclusion: 最佳专业化路径取决于任务模态，为开发更有效的科学智能系统提供了明确框架。

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCode是一个将多模态理解重新定义为代码生成的基准，使用SVG作为紧凑、可解释的可执行视觉表示，并提出了VCoder代理框架来提升视觉语言模型在视觉编码任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI进展主要关注语言为中心的编程任务，而视觉为中心的编码任务研究不足。受人类通过草图推理的启发，作者倡导使用SVG代码作为紧凑、可解释和可执行的视觉表示。

Method: 引入VCode基准，将多模态理解重新定义为代码生成任务；提出CodeVQA评估协议，通过策略模型在渲染的SVG上回答问题来评估符号保真度；开发VCoder代理框架，包含"带修订的思考"（迭代分析差异并优化SVG代码）和"带视觉工具的行动"（使用检测器和解析器提供结构化线索）。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型在生成忠实SVG方面表现不佳，揭示了语言为中心和视觉为中心编码之间的差距。VCoder在基准测试中相比表现最佳的Claude-4-Opus实现了12.3分的总体提升。人类研究表明人类和视觉语言模型在渲染SVG上都表现更差，但一致性揭示了符号视觉表示的前景。

Conclusion: SVG代码作为视觉表示具有潜力，但当前模型在视觉编码任务上仍有局限。VCoder框架通过迭代修订和视觉工具集成有效提升了性能，为视觉为中心的AI推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

TL;DR: 提出基于能量优化的视频镜头组装方法，通过学习参考视频的组装风格来自动化视频编辑，使无经验的用户也能制作视觉吸引力强的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前智能视频编辑技术无法捕捉创作者独特艺术表达的问题，传统镜头组装依赖经验丰富的编辑手动完成。

Method: 1) 使用大语言模型生成脚本并与视频库进行视觉语义匹配；2) 分割标记参考视频镜头，提取镜头尺寸、相机运动、语义等属性；3) 使用基于能量的模型学习这些属性，根据与参考风格的匹配度评分候选镜头序列；4) 结合多种语法规则优化镜头组装。

Result: 能够自动化按照特定逻辑、叙事需求或艺术风格排列组合独立镜头，学习参考视频的组装风格，创建连贯的视觉序列或整体视觉表达。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了镜头组装的自动化，还能学习参考视频的艺术风格，使无视频编辑经验的用户也能创作出视觉吸引力强的视频。

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

Motivation: 深度学习使机器人系统能在动态非结构化环境中交互，但关键任务应用需要评估大量异构数据，自动化报告生成对促进系统评估和接受至关重要。

Method: 开发了一个多模态传感器数据处理的自动化报告生成管道，完全依赖可在边缘设备部署的本地模型，无需外部服务。

Conclusion: 提出的本地模型自动化报告生成方法有效解决了移动机器人系统的评估需求，同时保护了隐私并消除了对外部服务的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public

*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel是一种自调优训练管道，通过逆Sobel重加权和深度分位数剪枝等方法，解决了稀疏体素光栅化在低频内容拟合、剪枝启发式算法和VRAM过度增长方面的问题，显著降低了内存使用并保持了感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏体素光栅化在优化式场景重建中速度快且可微分，但存在对低频内容拟合不足、依赖脆弱的剪枝启发式算法以及VRAM过度增长的问题。

Method: 采用逆Sobel重加权和训练中gamma斜坡使损失函数对低频敏感；使用基于深度分位数的剪枝逻辑替代固定阈值，通过EMA滞后保护和基于射线足迹的优先级驱动细分来稳定和优化结构。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks & Temples数据集上的实验显示，LiteVoxel减少了低频区域和边界不稳定性错误，同时保持PSNR/SSIM、训练时间和FPS与强SVRaster管道相当，关键是将峰值VRAM降低了约40%-60%。

Conclusion: LiteVoxel实现了更可预测、内存效率更高的训练，无需牺牲感知质量，并保留了先前设置遗漏的低频细节。

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

TL;DR: 本研究探索无监督学习方法用于剪切散斑图像的自动异常检测，评估了三种架构：全连接自编码器、卷积自编码器以及师生特征匹配模型，发现师生方法在分类鲁棒性和缺陷定位方面表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪切散斑技术作为一种无损检测方法，在工业应用中受到专家解释需求的限制。为减少对标记数据和人工评估的依赖，本研究旨在开发自动化的异常检测方法。

Method: 使用仅包含无缺陷数据的训练集，评估了三种无监督学习架构：全连接自编码器、卷积自编码器和师生特征匹配模型。开发了包含可重现缺陷模式的控制数据集，并在理想和实际变形条件下系统采集测量数据。

Result: 师生特征匹配方法在分类鲁棒性方面表现最佳，并能实现精确的缺陷定位。与自编码器模型相比，该方法在特征表示的可分离性方面表现更好，并通过t-SNE可视化得到验证。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了无监督深度学习在工业环境中实现可扩展、标签高效的剪切散斑检测的潜力，特别是师生方法在鲁棒性和定位能力方面的优势。

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Conclusion: 深度学习可以在体素级别可靠地预测个体特异性脑部MRI，为个体化预后提供了新机会。

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

Conclusion: UVH-26填补了现有全球基准的空白，证明了领域特定训练数据对印度复杂交通场景的重要性，为新兴国家智能交通系统的发展提供了基础。

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

Motivation: 解决跨视角（如空中-地面监控）视频行人重识别中的极端视角变化、尺度差异和时间不一致性问题

Method: 在ViT-B/16骨干网络上添加7个参数高效模块：跨流特征归一化、多分辨率特征协调、身份感知记忆模块、时序动态建模、跨视角特征对齐、分层时序模式学习和多视角身份一致性学习

Result: 在AG-VPReID基准测试中所有高度级别都达到最先进性能，在G2A-VReID和MARS数据集上表现出强泛化能力，仅增加约200万参数和0.7 GFLOPs，保持189 FPS实时效率

Conclusion: 精心设计的适配器模块可以显著增强跨视角鲁棒性和时间一致性，且不影响计算效率

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

TL;DR: VCFlow是一个无需特定受试者训练即可从fMRI重建视觉体验的分层解码框架，通过模拟人类视觉系统的腹背侧结构来学习多维表征，在仅牺牲7%准确度的情况下实现快速视频重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨受试者泛化问题，开发无需特定受试者训练就能从fMRI重建连续视觉体验的方法，具有临床应用潜力。

Method: 提出VCFlow分层解码框架，显式建模人类视觉系统的腹背侧结构，分离并利用早期视觉皮层、腹侧和背侧流的特征，采用特征级对比学习策略增强受试者不变语义表征提取。

Result: 相比传统方法需要12小时以上数据和大量计算，VCFlow仅牺牲7%平均准确度，但能在10秒内生成重建视频且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: VCFlow提供了一个快速且临床可扩展的解决方案，适用于未见过的受试者，在跨受试者脑解码方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

*Daichi Nagai,Ryugo Morita,Shunsuke Kitada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE是一个无需训练的零样本分层图像生成框架，通过噪声移植和培养技术实现前景、背景和复合层的语义和结构一致性，解决了现有方法需要大量数据集或只能生成孤立前景元素的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型只能输出单层扁平图像，无法满足专业应用对分层控制的需求。现有解决方案要么需要大量难以获取的数据集进行微调，要么只能生成孤立的前景元素而无法产生完整连贯的场景。

Method: 提出噪声移植和培养(NTC)技术，从前景和复合生成过程中提取中间潜在表示，将其移植到后续层的初始噪声中，确保各层之间的语义和结构一致性。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，这种无需训练的方法达到了与微调方法相当的性能，在保持高图像质量和保真度的同时增强了分层一致性。

Conclusion: TAUE不仅消除了昂贵的训练和数据集需求，还解锁了复杂组合编辑等新颖下游应用，为更易访问和可控的生成工作流程铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多动物跟踪对理解动物生态和行为至关重要，但由于栖息地、运动模式和物种外观的差异，传统方法需要大量模型微调和启发式设计。

Method: 结合Grounding Dino目标检测器和Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)跟踪器，并精心设计启发式方法，构建零样本跟踪框架。

Result: 在ChimpAct、Bird Flock Tracking、AnimalTrack和GMOT-40子集上的评估显示，在不同物种和环境中具有强大且一致的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了视觉基础模型在零样本多动物跟踪中的潜力，无需重新训练或超参数调整即可应用于新数据集。

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别系统容易受到呈现攻击的威胁，恶意行为者可以通过欺骗手段非法访问安全系统。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN框架进行活体检测，能够识别打印/显示、视频和包裹攻击。

Result: 创建了包含60个受试者500多个视频的2D欺骗攻击数据集，并提供了演示视频验证架构有效性。

Conclusion: 该鲁棒架构提供了无缝的活体检测，确保更快的生物特征认证。

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

TL;DR: 提出了UniPruneBench，一个统一的可扩展基准，用于评估多模态大模型中视觉令牌剪枝方法的性能，发现随机剪枝是一个强基线，没有单一方法在所有场景中都表现最佳，剪枝敏感度因任务而异，OCR任务最脆弱，剪枝比率是影响性能的主要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型因图像编码器引入的大量视觉令牌导致推理效率低下，现有的令牌压缩方法评估零散且不一致，需要统一的评估基准。

Method: 构建UniPruneBench基准，在6个能力维度和10个数据集上提供标准化协议，涵盖10种代表性压缩算法和3类LMMs（LLaVA-v1.5、Intern-VL3和Qwen2.5-VL），除了任务准确率外还包含运行时和预填充延迟等系统级指标。

Result: 实验发现：(1)随机剪枝是一个令人惊讶的强基线；(2)没有单一方法在所有场景中始终优于其他方法；(3)剪枝敏感度在不同任务间差异显著，OCR任务最脆弱；(4)剪枝比率是性能下降的主导因素。

Conclusion: UniPruneBench将为高效多模态建模的未来研究提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用固定的patch token，忽略了图像的空间和语义结构，需要更灵活的分词方法。

Method: 使用分层模型选择和信息准则的可微分分词器，支持像素级粒度自适应，并兼容现有架构。

Result: 在图像级分类和密集预测任务中表现优异，还支持开箱即用的栅格到矢量转换。

Conclusion: 该方法为Vision Transformer提供了更灵活和内容感知的分词机制，同时保持与预训练模型的兼容性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖中间表示来对齐跨模态特征，但存在中间特征生成方式不理想、参数多、可解释性差等问题，且未能充分利用中间特征。

Method: 使用中间生成图像作为可见光到红外模态的转换器，结合模态转换对比损失和模态查询正则化损失进行训练，无需额外参数。

Result: 在三个典型VI-ReID数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型显著且持续优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MTRL框架能够有效对齐跨模态特征，在保持与骨干网络相同推理速度的同时提升了VI-ReID任务的性能。

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的情感线索引导推理框架和VidEmo模型有效解决了视频情感分析的挑战，Emo-CFG数据集为情感理解任务提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

TL;DR: LLEXICORP是一个将概念相关性传播(CRP)与多模态大语言模型结合的模块化管道，能够自动为概念原型分配描述性名称并生成自然语言解释，显著降低了深度神经网络解释的门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CRP工作流程主要是手动的：专家需要检查激活图像来命名发现的概念，并从相关性图中合成冗长的解释，这限制了解释的可访问性和可扩展性。

Method: 引入LLEXICORP，这是一个模块化管道，将CRP与多模态大语言模型耦合。通过精心设计的提示词教语言模型CRP的语义，并强制执行命名和解释任务的分离。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的VGG16模型上进行定性评估，结果表明该方法能够自动生成针对不同受众的文本解释，为专家提供技术描述，为非技术利益相关者提供高级摘要。

Conclusion: 将基于概念的归因方法与大型语言模型集成可以显著降低解释深度神经网络的门槛，为更透明的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图像与文本的对齐研究已取得显著进展，但视频数据的时序特性在此背景下仍未被充分探索，需要研究视频-文本表示对齐以理解不同编码器的结构相似性和下游能力。

Method: 通过综合研究现代视频和语言编码器的视频-文本表示对齐能力，分析跨模态对齐对测试时数据丰富度的依赖性，提出参数化测试时缩放定律，并研究语义对齐与下游任务性能的相关性。

Result: 发现跨模态对齐高度依赖于测试时视觉和文本数据的丰富度，提出的缩放定律具有显著的预测能力；语义对齐与语义和非语义下游任务性能相关；时序推理与跨模态对齐存在相关性。

Conclusion: 视频-文本对齐是探索时空数据表示能力的信息化零样本方法，强对齐可能关联到通用视频表示和理解能力。

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

Motivation: 解决单图像3D头部重建面临的严重视图遮挡、弱感知监督以及3D空间编辑模糊性等固有挑战。

Method: 使用双分支编码器和ViT解码器通过迭代交叉注意力将2D特征提升到3D空间，采用高斯泼溅进行渲染，并基于DINOv2和SAM2.1进行感知监督。编辑时通过分离几何和样式输入实现语义控制。

Conclusion: PercHead提供了一个统一的框架，既能实现高质量的单图像3D头部重建，又能支持直观的语义3D编辑，在重建质量和编辑能力方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

TL;DR: MIRA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估模型在需要生成中间视觉图像来指导推理过程的场景中的表现。该基准包含546个多模态问题，强调通过"画图思考"的方式解决复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链方法仅依赖文本，但许多复杂问题需要视觉推理。MIRA旨在评估模型在需要生成和利用中间图像（如草图、结构图）进行推理的能力，这更接近人类解决问题的过程。

Method: MIRA包含546个标注了中间视觉图像和最终答案的多模态问题。提出了统一的评估协议，涵盖三个输入级别：仅图像和问题的直接输入、带思维提示的文本思维链输入、以及带注释图像线索和文本思维提示的视觉思维链输入。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有多模态大语言模型仅依赖文本提示时表现不佳，但当提供中间视觉线索时，所有模型和任务的平均相对增益达到33.7%。扩大搜索空间和设计对齐视觉思维链的文本提示只能带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了想象视觉信息在MIRA基准上实现成功推理的关键作用，表明视觉推理能力对于解决复杂问题至关重要。

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的深度伪造媒体对多媒体取证、错误信息检测和生物识别系统构成严重威胁，导致公众对法律系统信任度下降、欺诈增加和社会工程攻击。现有取证方法存在三个关键问题：非标准化基准、不一致的训练协议和有限的评估指标。

Method: 引入统一的基准测试框架，在受控和可复现条件下系统评估取证方法。基准测试了十种最先进的取证方法（从头训练、冻结和微调）和七个公开数据集（GAN和扩散生成），使用多种指标进行评估。

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

TL;DR: PLUTO-4是新一代病理学基础模型，包含紧凑型PLUTO-4S和前沿规模PLUTO-4G两个版本，在55万+WSI上预训练，在多种病理任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大规模病理图像基础模型的成功，需要开发更强大的下一代模型来提升病理诊断和研究的性能。

Method: 使用DINOv2自监督目标在55万+WSI上预训练两个ViT架构：紧凑高效的PLUTO-4S（多尺度部署）和前沿规模PLUTO-4G（单补丁尺寸最大化表示能力）。

Result: 在公共和内部基准测试中，PLUTO-4在多种任务上达到最先进性能，PLUTO-4G在皮肤病理诊断中提升11%，PLUTO-4S提供高吞吐量部署性能。

Conclusion: PLUTO-4作为转化研究和诊断用例的骨干模型，具有改变实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

*Dmitrii Pozdeev,Alexey Artemov,Ananta R. Bhattarai,Artem Sevastopolsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseMarks是一种新的人类头部学习表示方法，通过Vision Transformer网络为每个像素预测3D嵌入，在3D规范单元立方体中建立对应关系，实现高质量密集对应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决人类头部图像的高质量密集对应问题，特别是在不同姿态和个体间保持一致性，需要一种能够覆盖整个头部（包括头发）且对姿态变化鲁棒的表示方法。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer网络预测像素的3D嵌入，通过对比损失训练网络，结合多任务学习（面部标志点和分割约束），并利用潜在立方体特征保证嵌入的空间连续性。

Result: 在几何感知点匹配和单目头部跟踪方面达到最先进结果，能够处理姿态变化并覆盖整个头部区域，包括头发。

Conclusion: DenseMarks提供了一种可解释、可查询的规范空间表示，适用于语义部分查找、面部/头部跟踪和立体重建等任务，具有跨姿态和个体的一致性。

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

*Rongxin Chen,Yunfan Li,Yige Yuan,Bingbing Xu,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MPG框架，通过解码时组合范式实现LLM的多重人格生成，无需额外训练或外部模型，利用单一维度模型的隐式密度比作为"免费午餐"，设计SCR采样方法降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，基于重新训练的方法成本高且扩展性差，解码时方法依赖外部模型或启发式规则，限制了灵活性和鲁棒性。需要一种无需额外训练、灵活控制多重人格的解决方案。

Method: 提出MPG框架，将任务重新表述为从聚合隐式密度比的目标策略中采样。设计SCR（推测性块级拒绝采样）方法，以块为单位生成响应并通过滑动窗口内的估计阈值并行验证。

Result: 在MBTI人格和角色扮演任务上的实验显示，MPG有效性提升达16%-18%，显著降低计算开销的同时保持高质量生成。

Conclusion: MPG框架成功实现了无需额外训练的多重人格生成，SCR采样方法有效平衡了计算效率和生成质量，为LLM个性化提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of
multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing
retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time
methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation
(MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly
controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models
or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional
models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target
strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design
Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates
responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds
within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead
while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and
Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to
16%-18%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Libra117/MPG .

TL;DR: GEMS使用图神经网络在离散选择模拟任务中匹配或超越大型语言模型，同时模型规模小三个数量级，效率更高且可解释性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在人类模拟任务中是否必须使用大型语言模型，或者更小、领域特定的模型是否足够。

Method: 将离散选择模拟任务建模为图上的链接预测问题，使用图神经网络，仅在需要时整合语言表示。

Result: 在三个关键设置和三个模拟数据集上的评估显示，GEMS达到与LLM相当或更好的准确率，同时效率、可解释性和透明度显著更高。

Conclusion: 图基建模作为LLM的轻量级替代方案在人类模拟中具有前景，展示了在特定任务中更小模型的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with
applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are
LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We
identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices
among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass
strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We
introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete
choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging
relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when
needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show
that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater
efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of
graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IG-Pruning是一种新颖的输入感知块级剪枝方法，通过动态选择层掩码来减少大型语言模型的计算成本，无需大量训练即可实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型计算需求增长，高效推理对实际部署至关重要。现有深度剪枝方法依赖固定块掩码，在不同任务和输入上表现不佳。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 通过语义聚类和L0优化发现多样化掩码候选；2) 在推理时动态选择层掩码，无需大量训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在性能上持续优于最先进的静态深度剪枝方法。

Conclusion: IG-Pruning特别适合资源受限的部署场景，为大型语言模型的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个自动生成医疗查询并评估LLM回答的基础设施，发现LLM评估者间一致性较低，建议使用多个LLM评估器以避免统计显著但不可泛化的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗聊天机器人必须在涉及非医疗因素（如人口统计信息）的情况下提供一致的建议，但现有LLM存在幻觉、遗漏和偏见问题，需要理解其失败条件。

Method: 开发了自动生成查询的基础设施：1）通过采样患者人口统计、病史、疾病和写作风格创建现实问题；2）使用LLM-as-a-judge和代理工作流程进行幻觉和遗漏检测。

Result: LLM标注者间一致性较低（平均Cohen's Kappa κ=0.118），只有特定的（回答、评估）LLM对在写作风格、性别和种族方面产生统计显著差异。

Conclusion: 建议使用多个LLM作为评估器以避免非泛化结果，特别是在缺乏真实数据的情况下，并建议发布LLM间一致性指标以提高透明度。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTD-Bench是一个突破性的基准测试，通过要求模型通过点阵或可执行代码生成绘图，将LLM评估从抽象分数转变为可直接观察的视觉输出，揭示了模型在空间推理方面的严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估范式存在关键盲点，依赖不透明的数值指标掩盖了空间推理的基本限制，无法直观理解模型能力，导致报告性能与实际能力之间存在危险脱节。

Method: LTD-Bench采用全面方法，包含互补的生成任务（测试空间想象力）和识别任务（评估空间感知），在三个渐进难度级别上系统评估语言-空间映射的两个关键方向。

Result: 对最先进模型的广泛实验暴露了令人担忧的能力差距：即使在传统基准测试中表现优异的LLM，在建立语言与空间概念之间的双向映射方面也存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: LTD-Bench的视觉输出支持强大的诊断分析，提供了一种研究模型相似性的潜在方法，揭示了LLM作为真正世界模型的根本局限性。

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Solomon是一个多模态嵌入器，能够自适应地决定何时进行查询增强，只在必要时进行增强以提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的嵌入器对所有查询都进行增强，导致显著的嵌入延迟，且某些查询的增强可能损害性能。现有方法也未在多模态环境中探索。

Method: 首先将训练数据集中的查询分为需要增强和不需要增强两组，利用强大的多模态LLM为需要增强的查询生成合适的增强内容，然后通过自适应查询增强机制，只在必要时进行增强。

Result: 实验结果显示，M-Solomon不仅大幅超越了不进行增强的基线方法，也优于始终进行增强的基线方法，同时提供了更快的嵌入延迟。

Conclusion: M-Solomon通过自适应查询增强策略，在多模态检索任务中实现了更好的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在需要深厚文化、语言和专业知识的高度专业化领域表现不佳，特别是传统医学系统如阿育吠陀包含的复杂知识，主流LLM无法准确解释和应用。

Method: 从Param-1-2.9B模型微调，使用专家精心策划的阿育吠陀数据集，包含英印双语的情境感知、推理和客观问答，采用严格标注协议确保事实准确性和教学清晰度。

Result: 在BhashaBench-Ayur基准测试中，AyurParam不仅超越了同规模（1.5-3B参数）的所有开源指令调优模型，还表现出与更大模型相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: AyurParam的结果强调了在提供可靠、文化一致的AI用于专业医学知识时，真实领域适应和高质量监督的必要性。

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

TL;DR: AutoAdv是一个无需训练的多轮越狱攻击框架，通过在对话中结合模式管理、温度管理和两阶段重写策略，在Llama-3.1-8B上达到95%的攻击成功率，比单轮攻击提升24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的安全评估主要关注单轮交互，而现实中的攻击往往通过多轮自适应对话展开，现有对齐策略无法有效防御多轮越狱攻击。

Method: AutoAdv结合三种自适应机制：模式管理器从成功攻击中学习改进提示，温度管理器基于失败模式动态调整采样参数，两阶段重写策略先伪装有害请求再迭代优化。

Result: 在多个商业和开源模型（GPT-4o-mini、Qwen3-235B、Mistral-7B）上的广泛评估显示，多轮攻击始终优于单轮方法，当前安全机制存在持续漏洞。

Conclusion: 针对单轮交互优化的对齐策略在扩展对话中无法保持鲁棒性，迫切需要开发多轮感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过合并领域特定的持续预训练专家模型来构建多技能金融大语言模型，提出了三阶段评估框架，并比较了三种合并方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在金融等专业领域表现不佳，需要融合领域知识、数学推理和多语言处理等多种技能。直接进行多技能训练成本高昂且不稳定，而合并领域特定的持续预训练专家模型是一个实用的替代方案。

Method: 创建金融、数学和日语三个领域的专家模型，提出三阶段评估框架（知识恢复、互补性和涌现性），在包含18个任务8个数据集的综合金融基准上评估三种合并方法：任务算术、TIES和DARE-TIES。

Result: 合并专家模型与其基础模型可以恢复在持续预训练中丢失的通用知识；合并不同专家模型能提升性能并产生跨领域的涌现技能；任务算术方法表现强劲但对超参数敏感，TIES方法更稳健；模型相似性与合并成功相关，但涌现技能取决于更复杂的因素。

Conclusion: 这是首个对持续预训练模型合并的基础性分析，建立了一个原则性框架，为从现有资产构建多技能大语言模型提供了明确指导。

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing
assets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究角色提示对大型语言模型在宏观经济预测任务中的影响，探索LLM是否能够达到专业人类预测者的水平。

Method: 使用PersonaHub语料库中的2,368个经济学相关角色提示GPT-4o，复制ECB专业预测者调查的50个季度轮次(2013-2025)，并与人类专家小组和无角色描述的基准预测进行比较。

Result: GPT-4o与人类预测者准确度相似，统计显著但实际差异不大；角色描述对预测准确度无显著提升；在样本外评估中GPT-4o能保持竞争力但表现有差异。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在提供相关背景数据时能在宏观经济预测中达到竞争性准确度，但角色提示可省略以节省计算成本，且多样化提示产生的预测比人类小组更加同质化。

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes
for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and
subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural
Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract
structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match
candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document
parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to
capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics,
Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space
to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline
is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and
matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of
resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains,
demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The
system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of
interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces
a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines
promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and
large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪模型通常忽略问题文本这一重要教学洞察来源，限制了预测性能，错失了利用问题内容的机会。

Method: 提出NTKT方法，将知识追踪重构为使用预训练大语言模型的下一词预测任务，将学生历史和问题内容表示为文本序列。

Result: 实验显著优于最先进的神经知识追踪模型，在冷启动问题和用户上具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 问题内容在知识追踪中很重要，利用大语言模型的预训练表示能更有效地建模学生学习。

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGES是一种贝叶斯框架，通过置信度信号自适应停止采样，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少LLM调用次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自一致性策略需要固定调用次数且在正确答案罕见时可能失败的问题

Method: 使用基于标记概率或奖励模型的置信度信号构建候选答案的后验分布，当候选答案后验质量超过阈值时自适应停止采样

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，平均减少约69%的模型调用次数（如从16.0次降至4.9次），同时准确性与自一致性策略相差不超过0.06个百分点

Conclusion: CGES框架在保持准确性的同时显著提高了LLM推理的效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

TL;DR: TRACE框架通过程序化策略应用解决LLM对齐-现实差距问题，实现精确的策略更新而不损害模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法产生静态、脆弱且维护成本高的模型，无法适应不断发展的规范和政策，存在对齐-现实差距问题

Method: TRACE框架通过程序化筛选现有偏好数据、识别高影响冲突、应用混合优化来干净地反转、丢弃或保留偏好，同时保护模型性能

Result: 在多个模型家族上实现稳健的重新对齐，在复杂政策变化下强制执行新原则而不降低通用能力

Conclusion: 为维护LLM对齐提供了可扩展、动态且经济高效的范式，为可持续和负责任的AI部署奠定基础

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

Motivation: 现有研究未深入探讨新知识微调导致的事实幻觉的具体表现和机制，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了Biography-Reasoning数据集，进行细粒度分析，并提出KnownPatch方法在训练后期添加已知知识样本来缓解幻觉。

Result: 当特定知识类型完全由新知识组成时，LLMs的幻觉倾向显著增加；KnownPatch能有效缓解新知识引发的幻觉，并改善模型性能。

Conclusion: 特定知识类型的高陌生度是幻觉的主要驱动因素，KnownPatch通过修复关键实体的注意力模式来有效缓解新知识学习导致的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型微调后存储成本高，研究发现微调只影响少量参数，且参数更新具有低秩和稀疏特性，需要更高效的存储方法。

Result: 在相同内存预算下，该方法相比单独使用低秩近似或稀疏化，实现了显著的存储效率和更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 结合低秩近似和稀疏化的方法能有效提升微调模型参数的存储效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Motivation: 翻译中经常添加背景信息使隐含的文化含义对新受众显化，这种现象在翻译理论中广泛讨论但很少被计算建模。

Method: 使用TED-Multi和Europarl语料库，通过空对齐识别候选显化案例，并用主动学习和人工标注进行精炼。

Result: 实体和系统级显化最常见，主动学习将分类器准确率提高7-8个百分点，在跨语言中达到0.88准确率和0.82 F1值。

Conclusion: PragExTra将语用显化确立为可测量的跨语言现象，为构建文化感知的机器翻译迈出一步。

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,
multilingualism, explicitation

Motivation: 前沿大语言模型在低资源语言上表现不佳，这种性能缺陷可能降低AI效用，从而减缓低资源语言国家的AI采用

Method: 使用加权回归模型从社会经济和人口因素中分离出语言效应

Result: 低资源语言国家的AI用户比例相对于基准低约20%

Conclusion: 语言可访问性是AI公平扩散的重要独立障碍

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

Motivation: 现有去中心化多LLM系统为每个输入调用多个模型，导致推理成本高昂且不可控。需要设计成本高效且可控的多智能体LLM系统。

Method: 采用集中式框架，将协调问题建模为具有双重目标的强化学习：最大化任务性能同时最小化总体推理成本，并在多预算设置下优化性能成本权衡。

Result: 在四个不同基准测试中，CoRL使单个系统在高预算设置下超越最佳专家LLM，同时在低预算模式下保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 集中式协调为可扩展和成本高效的多智能体LLM系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: AMER是一种新的检索器架构，通过自回归生成多个查询向量来检索相关文档，解决了传统单一查询向量在多模态相关文档分布中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索器使用单一查询向量，但查询的相关文档分布可能是多模态的（如不同解释），现有检索器在目标文档嵌入距离较大时表现不佳。

Method: 开发了自回归多嵌入检索器（AMER），自回归生成多个查询向量，所有预测的查询向量都用于从语料库中检索文档。

Result: 在合成向量化数据上，AMER能完美捕捉多个目标分布，性能比单嵌入模型好4倍；在真实世界多答案检索数据集上，相比单嵌入基线分别有4%和21%的相对增益，在目标文档嵌入相似度较低的子集上增益更大。

Conclusion: 多查询向量检索器具有潜力，为未来工作开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

TL;DR: MemSearcher是一种搜索代理工作流，通过迭代维护紧凑内存来平衡信息完整性和计算效率，在保持准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统搜索代理要么保留完整交互历史导致长上下文和高计算成本，要么仅使用当前轮次丢失重要信息，这种权衡限制了搜索代理的可扩展性。

Method: 提出MemSearcher工作流，在每个轮次融合用户问题与内存生成推理轨迹，执行搜索动作，并更新内存仅保留任务必需信息；引入多上下文GRPO强化学习框架联合优化推理、搜索策略和内存管理。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试上显著优于强基线：Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct相对平均提升11%，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升12%。3B版本的MemSearcher甚至优于7B基线模型。

Conclusion: 在信息完整性和效率之间取得平衡既能提高准确性又能降低计算开销，MemSearcher通过稳定多轮交互的上下文长度实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and
lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at

TL;DR: Oolong是一个长上下文推理基准测试，包含合成任务和真实世界对话任务，要求模型分析文本块并聚合分析结果来回答分布性问题。前沿模型在128K上下文长度下准确率均低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文评估主要依赖检索任务，允许模型忽略大部分上下文作为噪声，这仅代表一种任务类型。需要评估模型能否真正分析长上下文中的各个部分并进行聚合推理。

Method: 创建Oolong基准测试，分为两个任务集：Oolong-synth（自然合成任务，可轻松消融推理问题组件）和Oolong-real（需要推理真实世界对话数据）。任务要求模型对大量示例进行推理，执行分类和计数，并处理时间和用户关系。

Result: 即使是最前沿的模型（GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4、Gemini-2.5-Pro）在128K上下文长度下，两个任务集的准确率都低于50%，表明当前模型在长上下文推理方面仍有很大挑战。

Conclusion: Oolong基准测试揭示了当前模型在长上下文推理任务上的局限性，为开发能够真正推理大量文本的模型提供了评估工具和数据。

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

Motivation: 研究热颗粒注入和提取对热分层流体系统稳定性的影响，特别关注颗粒与流体间热耦合的作用。

Method: 分析颗粒Rayleigh-Bénard系统的线性稳定性，通过改变比热容比ε等参数来研究热耦合对稳定性的影响。

Result: 增加比热容比ε会系统性增强稳定性，这种稳定效应在重颗粒、轻颗粒、不同体积通量、注入速度和方向以及注入温度条件下都持续存在。当颗粒体积热容量接近流体时(ε=O(1))，稳定效应达到饱和。

Conclusion: 热颗粒注入通过改变基态温度分布来增强系统稳定性，具体机制是相间热交换减少了注入壁附近的温度梯度，从而削弱了浮力驱动的运动。

Abstract: We investigate the linear stability of a thermally stratified fluid layer
confined between horizontal walls and subject to continuous injection of dilute
thermal particles at one boundary and extraction at the opposite, forming a
particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard (pRB) system. The analysis focuses on the
influence of thermal coupling between the dispersed and carrier phases,
quantified by the specific heat capacity ratio $\epsilon$. Increasing
$\epsilon$ systematically enhances stability, with this effect persisting
across a wide range of conditions, including heavy and light particles,
variations in volumetric flux, injection velocity and direction, and injection
temperature. The stabilizing influence saturates when the volumetric heat
capacity of the particles approaches that of the fluid, $\epsilon = O(1)$. The
physical mechanism is attributed to a modification of the base-state
temperature profile caused by interphase heat exchange, which reduces thermal
gradients near the injection wall and weakens buoyancy-driven motion.

Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics,
have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical
physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space
calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central
idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop
observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations
into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This
framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable
and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic
turbulence--the Euler ensemble--which is shown to be dual to a solvable string
theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and
temporal scaling laws, which are shown to be governed by two related, infinite
spectra of intermittency and decay exponents, respectively, both derived from
the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase
transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of
quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts
log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions, effects not described by
standard phenomenology, for which there is now emerging evidence from
high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical
structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow
points towards the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also
yields a new type of minimal surface that solves the QCD loop equations in the
limit of large loops.

### [92] [Role of varying Reynolds number for flow past a rotating cylinder at high rotation rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02229)

TL;DR: 对旋转圆柱体绕流进行分岔分析，使用DRP数值方法求解二维可压缩Navier-Stokes方程，发现临界雷诺数5650后Magnus-Robins效应发生显著变化，并训练ANN实现99.9%计算时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旋转圆柱体在不同雷诺数下的流动特性，为可压缩流动求解器提供基准测试工具，分析非定常力分布和涡动力学。

Method: 采用色散关系保持数值方法求解二维可压缩Navier-Stokes方程，在101个测试案例上进行计算，总计算量达10^6核小时，并训练人工神经网络作为快速替代方案。

Result: 发现临界雷诺数5650是流动行为转变的关键点，旋转效应在较高雷诺数下饱和，ANN将模拟时间减少99.9%，精度达到90-99%。

Conclusion: 旋转圆柱体流动在临界雷诺数5650后发生显著变化，ANN可作为高效替代工具进行参数扫描，为流动控制提供重要见解。

Abstract: The present study reports comprehensive bifurcation analysis of flow past a
rotating cylinder at a fixed rotation rate by varying free-stream Reynolds
number ($Re_{\infty}$) from 1000-6000 in intervals of 50. Two-dimensional
compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using dispersion relation
preserving numerical methods over 101 test cases, amounting to $10^6$ core
hours of computing. The dataset produced from high-fidelity simulations serve
as useful benchmarking tools for testing compressible flow solvers, estimating
unsteady force distribution and vorticity dynamics. For moderate $Re_{\infty}$,
rotation induces circulation that reduces pressure drag with increasing
$Re_{\infty}$. For higher $Re_{\infty}$, boundary layer becomes thinner with
suppressed flow separation, but effect of rotation saturates. Thus, benefits of
increasing $Re_{\infty}$ taper off and pressure recovery stalls. The
bifurcation analysis reveals a critical $Re_{\infty}$ of 5650 beyond which
global behavior of Magnus-Robins effect changes significantly. Supercritical
flow is receptive to time-dependent instabilities and structures in wake of the
cylinder become dynamically unstable. Even small changes in $Re_{\infty}$ leads
to different instantaneous force distributions and sharp fluctuations in lift
and drag calculations. Stronger, coherent vortices in the wake generate
consistent, high-energy periodic signals, contributing to strong Fourier
amplitudes in spectra. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using
simulation datasets to serve as fast, inexpensive alternatives for calculating
lift, drag, and onset time of instability. The ANN reduces time required for
simulation by 99.9\%, enabling dense parametric sweeps. Maximum accuracy
achieved for the ANN is between 90-99\% for the parameters examined.

TL;DR: 提出了一个预测性主谱模型，用于描述微流体系统中的类湍流流动，统一了电动力学、活性、界面和可压缩湍流等多种湍流状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以统一描述微流体系统中不同类型的湍流状态，需要开发一个能够预测湍流谱并仅依赖全局可观测量的紧凑模型。

Method: 扩展Pao的粘性范围闭合方法，引入(i)依赖于可测量无量纲数的自适应惯性范围斜率，和(ii)捕捉熵产生汇的物理特定截止机制。

Result: 与报告数据比较，模型能够重现谱斜率和耗散截止，仅需全局观测量（速度、粘度、泰勒微尺度和强迫强度）。

Conclusion: 该框架为湍流微流动提供了一个设计级的预测工具，可在计算密集的DNS或CFD之前使用。

Abstract: We present a predictive master spectrum describing turbulence-like flows in
microfluidic systems. Extending Pao's viscous-range closure, the model
introduces (i) an adaptive inertial-range slope dependent on measurable
dimensionless numbers and (ii) a physics-specific cutoff that captures
entropy-producing sinks such as electrokinetic forcing, compliant walls, active
stresses, and interfacial tension. This formulation unifies turbulence regimes
-- electrokinetic, active, interfacial, and compressible -- within one compact
expression. Comparison with reported data reproduces both spectral slopes and
dissipation cutoffs while requiring only global observables (velocity,
viscosity, Taylor microscale, and forcing strength). The framework provides a
design-level predictive tool for turbulent microflows prior to computationally
heavy DNS or CFD.

Abstract: The present study explores the impact of a non-Newtonian fluid drop on a
rigid surface using a mesh-free approach, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynam-ics. The
complex interaction between viscous and elastic forces during drop impact may
be reproduced by integrating the Oldroyd-B model, which de-scribes viscoelastic
fluids, into the developed computational framework. A suit-able boundary
condition is assumed for interaction between fluid and solid sur-faces. The
ongoing study examines how a droplet deforms, spreads, and recoils after an
impact due to its viscoelasticity. The developed computational frame-work is
validated by comparing results from existing literature, providing an
understanding of how viscoelasticity influences drop-impact behaviour and
opening up new avenues for subsequent research in fluid dynamic problems.

Method: 采用区域分解策略，基于尺度敏感物理量将湍流快照划分为子域，在每个子域中使用仅在HIT数据库上预训练的尺度索引模型合成湍流。

Result: SoZoGAN在未经训练的HIT、湍流边界层和通道流中展示了高精度、跨域泛化能力和鲁棒性，实现了零样本超分辨率重建。

Conclusion: 该框架具有强泛化能力，适用于均匀和非均匀湍流，可扩展到更广泛的工业和自然湍流，且架构无关，可扩展到其他深度学习模型。

Abstract: Fully resolving turbulent flows remains challenging due to turbulent systems'
multiscale complexity. Existing data-driven approaches typically demand
expensive retraining for each flow scenario and struggle to generalize beyond
their training conditions. Leveraging the universality of small-scale turbulent
motions (Kolmogorov's K41 theory), we propose a Scale-oriented Zonal Generative
Adversarial Network (SoZoGAN) framework for high-fidelity, zero-shot turbulence
generation across diverse domains. Unlike conventional methods, SoZoGAN is
trained exclusively on a single dataset of moderate-Reynolds-number homogeneous
isotropic turbulence (HIT). The framework employs a zonal decomposition
strategy, partitioning turbulent snapshots into subdomains based on
scale-sensitive physical quantities. Within each subdomain, turbulence is
synthesized using scale-indexed models pre-trained solely on the HIT database.
SoZoGAN demonstrates high accuracy, cross-domain generalizability, and
robustness in zero-shot super-resolution of unsteady flows, as validated on
untrained HIT, turbulent boundary layer, and channel flow. Its strong
generalization, demonstrated for homogenous and inhomogenous turbulence cases,
suggests potential applicability to a wider range of industrial and natural
turbulent flows. The scale-oriented zonal framework is architecture-agnostic,
readily extending beyond GANs to other deep learning models.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一个通过利用齐次对称性来精确计算投影的通用框架，用于在数值求解微分方程时保持不变量，相比标准方法在精度和效率上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准投影方法在保持微分方程不变量时需要数值求解投影步骤，这可能导致计算复杂性和精度损失。本文旨在开发一种能够精确计算投影的框架，以更高效地保持不变量。

Method: 通过利用齐次对称性，将任意基础积分器投影到保持不变量的流形上，能够精确且封闭形式地计算投影，从而得到显式的保持不变量积分器。

Result: 该方法能够为广泛的非线性系统提供高阶保持不变量积分器，计算开销可忽略不计，在双摆、开普勒ODE以及KdV和Camassa-Holm PDE等数值实验中显示出比标准方法更高的精度和效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架提供了一种高效、高精度的方法来保持微分方程的不变量，适用于各种非线性系统和偏微分方程，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We develop a general framework for numerically solving differential equations
while preserving invariants. As in standard projection methods, we project an
arbitrary base integrator onto an invariant-preserving manifold, however, our
method exploits homogeneous symmetries to evaluate the projection exactly and
in closed form. This yields explicit invariant-preserving integrators for a
broad class of nonlinear systems, as well as pseudo-invariant-preserving
schemes capable of preserving multiple invariants to arbitrarily high
precision. The resulting methods are high-order and introduce negligible
computational overhead relative to the base solver. When incorporated into
adaptive solvers such as Dormand-Prince 8(5,3), they provide error-controlled,
invariant-preserving, high-order time-stepping schemes. Numerical experiments
on double-pendulum and Kepler ODEs as well as semidiscretised KdV and
Camassa-Holm PDEs demonstrate substantial improvements in both accuracy and
efficiency over standard approaches.

Motivation: 从相干X射线测量中恢复高分辨率结构和成分信息需要解决耦合、非线性且不适定的逆问题。叠层衍射成像重建复杂透射函数，而X射线荧光提供元素特异性对比但空间分辨率较低。需要整合这两种互补模式以获得更好的重建效果。

Method: 构建联合变分框架，将叠层衍射成像和X射线荧光整合为共享空间变量的单一非线性最小二乘问题。该框架强制结构和成分估计之间的跨模态一致性，改善条件性并促进稳定收敛。

Result: 数值实验表明，联合重建相比单独反演实现了更快的收敛速度、更清晰和更定量的重建结果，以及更低的相对误差。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法展示了多模态变分公式如何在计算X射线成像中增强稳定性、分辨率和可解释性。

Abstract: Recovering high-resolution structural and compositional information from
coherent X-ray measurements involves solving coupled, nonlinear, and ill-posed
inverse problems. Ptychography reconstructs a complex transmission function
from overlapping diffraction patterns, while X-ray fluorescence provides
quantitative, element-specific contrast at lower spatial resolution. We
formulate a joint variational framework that integrates these two modalities
into a single nonlinear least-squares problem with shared spatial variables.
This formulation enforces cross-modal consistency between structural and
compositional estimates, improving conditioning and promoting stable
convergence. The resulting optimization couples complementary contrast
mechanisms (i.e., phase and absorption from ptychography, elemental composition
from fluorescence) within a unified inverse model. Numerical experiments on
simulated data demonstrate that the joint reconstruction achieves faster
convergence, sharper and more quantitative reconstructions, and lower relative
error compared with separate inversions. The proposed approach illustrates how
multimodal variational formulations can enhance stability, resolution, and
interpretability in computational X-ray imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cahn-Hilliard方程在物理和化学领域有广泛应用，需要描述溶液与边界之间的短程相互作用，因此构建了带有边界能量的动态边界条件。

Method: 采用凸分裂数值方法结合有限差分空间近似，通过傅里叶投影保持边界质量守恒，引入三角辅助函数实现体质量守恒，同时保持截断误差的收敛阶数。

Conclusion: 所提出的数值方法能够有效处理Cahn-Hilliard方程的动态边界条件问题，在保持质量守恒的同时获得了理论上的收敛性保证。

Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation has a wide range of applications in many areas of
physics and chemistry. To describe the short-range interaction between the
solution and the boundary, scientists have constructed dynamical boundary
conditions by introducing boundary energy. In this work, the dynamical boundary
condition is located on two opposite edges of a square domain and is connected
with bulk by a normal derivative. A convex-splitting numerical approach is
proposed to enforce the positivity-preservation and energy dissipation,
combined with the finite difference spatial approximation. The
$\ell^\infty(0,T;H_h^{-1}) \cap \ell^2(0,T;H_h^1)$ convergence analysis and
error estimate is theoretically established, with the first order accuracy in
time and second order accuracy in space. The bulk and surface discrete mass
conservation of the exact solution is required to reach the mean-zero property
of the error function, so that the associated discrete $H_h^{-1}$ norm is
well-defined. The mass conservation on the physical boundary is maintained by
the classic Fourier projection. In terms of the mass conservation in bulk, we
introduce a trigonometric auxiliary function based on the truncation error
expansion, so that the bulk mass conservation is achieved, and it has no effect
on the boundary. The smoothness of trigonometric function makes the Taylor
expansion valid and maintains the convergence order of truncation error as
well. As a result, the convergence analysis could be derived with a careful
nonlinear error estimate.

Abstract: Taking the largest principal angle as the distance function between same
dimensional nontrivial linear subspaces in $\mathds{R}^n$, we describe the
class of subspaces deviating from all the coordinate ones by at least
$\arccos(1 / \sqrt{n})$. This study compliments and is motivated by the
long-standing hypothesis put forward in \cite{GTZ1997} and essentially stating
that so-defined distance to the closest coordinate subspace cannot exceed
$\arccos(1 / \sqrt{n})$. In this context, the subspaces presented here claim to
be the extremal ones.
  Realized as the star spaces of all nontrivial 2-connected series-parallel
graphs with certain edge weights and arbitrary edge directions, the given
subspaces may be of interest beyond numerical linear algebra within which the
original problem was formulated.

Abstract: This work presents a mathematical model to enable rapid prediction of
airborne contaminant transport based on scarce sensor measurements. The method
is designed for applications in critical infrastructure protection (CIP), such
as evacuation planning following contaminant release. In such scenarios, timely
and reliable decision-making is essential, despite limited observation data. To
identify contaminant sources, we formulate an inverse problem governed by an
advection-diffusion equation. Given the problem's underdetermined nature, we
further employ a variational regularization ansatz and model the unknown
contaminant sources as distribution over the spatial domain. To efficiently
solve the arising inverse problem, we employ a problem-specific variant of the
Primal-Dual-Active-Point (PDAP) algorithm which efficiently approximates sparse
minimizers of the inverse problem by alternating between greedy location
updates and source intensity optimization. The approach is demonstrated on two-
and three-dimensional test cases involving both instantaneous and continuous
contaminant sources and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with
$L^2$-regularization. Its effectiveness is further illustrated in complex
domains with real-world building geometries imported from OpenStreetMap.

Abstract: The cyclic reduction (CR) algorithm is an efficient method for solving
quadratic matrix equations that arise in quasi-birth-death (QBD) stochastic
processes. However, its convergence is not guaranteed when the associated

this limitation, we introduce a novel iteration method, referred to as the
Block-Shifted CR algorithm, that improves the CR algorithm by utilizing
singular value decomposition (SVD) and block shift-and-deflate techniques. This
new approach extends the applicability of existing solvers to a broader class

Abstract: We present an estimation of the condition numbers of the \emph{mass} and

on the unit sphere~$\mathbb{S}^d$. In particular, when $\{\theta_j^*\}_{j=1}^n
\subset \mathbb{S}^d$ is \emph{antipodally quasi-uniform}, the condition number
is sharp. Indeed, in this case, we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for the
full spectrum of eigenvalues and characterize the structure of the
corresponding eigenspaces, showing that the smallest eigenvalues are associated
with an eigenbasis of low-degree polynomials while the largest eigenvalues are
linked to high-degree polynomials. This spectral analysis establishes a precise

Motivation: 传统跨国公司通过有形资产成本加成将利润转移到低税区避税，而高科技跨国公司则通过无形资产特许权使用费进行避税，需要研究这两种方式在不同业务结构下的效果差异。

Method: 比较分析两种主要业务结构：完全信息下的佣金运营结构(C)和委托-代理框架下的有限风险运营结构(R)，研究税收差异、加成和特许权使用费对决策的影响。

Result: 税收差异在C结构下总能提高跨国公司利润，但在R结构下存在非单调行为；当订单量较小时，加成比特许权使用费更快提高利润，反之则特许权使用费更快。

Conclusion: 跨国公司的避税策略效果取决于业务结构和订单规模，不同转移定价方式在不同情境下具有不同的优势。

Abstract: While conventional multinational firms (MNFs) often avoid taxes by
transferring their profits to low-tax regions through markup on tangible asset
costs, high-tech MNFs may avoid taxes by transferring royalty fees to
intangible assets (i.e., royalty-based transfer prices). This study
investigates the effects of tax differences, markups, and royalties on
decision-making. We also compare the different effects of markups and royalties
on the improvement of MNFs' after-tax profit under two main business
structures: the commissionaire operational structure (C) with complete
information, and the limited-risk operational structure (R) in the
principal-agent setting. We find that the tax difference always improves MNFs'
profits under the C structure, whereas non-monotonic behavior exists under the
R structure. More interestingly, when the order quantity is relatively small,
the markup improves MNFs' profits faster than the royalty; conversely, the
royalty improves MNFs' profits faster than the markup.

Conclusion: 该方法为多孔介质方程和Burgers方程提供了稳定、高效且收敛性良好的数值求解框架，扩展了最优运输理论在偏微分方程数值解中的应用。

Abstract: We study the discretization, convergence, and numerical implementation of
recent reformulations of the quadratic porous medium equation (multidimensional
and anisotropic) and Burgers' equation (one-dimensional, with optional
viscosity), as forward in time variants of the Benamou-Brenier formulation of
optimal transport. This approach turns those evolution problems into global
optimization problems in time and space, of which we introduce a
discretization, one of whose originalities lies in the harmonic interpolation
of the densities involved. We prove that the resulting schemes are
unconditionally stable w.r.t. the space and time steps, and we establish a
quadratic convergence rate for the dual PDE solution, under suitable
assumptions. We also show that the schemes can be efficiently solved
numerically using a proximal splitting method and a global space-time fast
Fourier transform, and we illustrate our results with numerical experiments.

*Massimiliano Moda,Karel J. in 't Hout,Michèle Vanmaele,Fred Espen Benth*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种在双资产无限活动指数Lévy模型下对欧式期权进行估值的数值方法，该方法将一维情况扩展到二维，适用于一般Lévy测度，并展示了良好的二阶收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Wang等人开发的一维有效方法扩展到二维设置，以处理更复杂的双资产期权定价问题，特别是在无限活动指数Lévy模型框架下。

Method: 开发了非局部积分项的定制离散化，通过快速傅里叶变换高效评估；采用半拉格朗日θ方法进行时间离散化，以分裂方式处理扩散项（隐式）和积分项（显式固定点迭代）。

Result: 在正态温和稳定动态下的平均看跌期权数值实验中，当指数Lévy过程具有有限变差时，该方法显示出良好的二阶收敛性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将一维期权定价技术扩展到二维Lévy模型，提供了一种高效且收敛性良好的数值解决方案，特别适用于具有有限变差的指数Lévy过程。

Abstract: We propose a numerical method for the valuation of European-style options
under two-asset infinite-activity exponential L\'evy models. Our method extends
the effective approach developed by Wang, Wan & Forsyth (2007) for the
1-dimensional case to the 2-dimensional setting and is applicable for general
L\'evy measures under mild assumptions. A tailored discretization of the
non-local integral term is developed, which can be efficiently evaluated by
means of the fast Fourier transform. For the temporal discretization, the
semi-Lagrangian theta-method is employed in a convenient splitting fashion,
where the diffusion term is treated implicitly and the integral term is handled
explicitly by a fixed-point iteration. Numerical experiments for
put-on-the-average options under Normal Tempered Stable dynamics reveal
favourable second-order convergence of our method whenever the exponential
L\'evy process has finite-variation.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文研究了从实矩阵中选择k个代表列的各种标准，包括绝对体积和S最优性最大化、范数和条件数最小化、稳定秩最大化以及相对体积最大化等优化问题，证明了这些标准都是NP难问题且不存在多项式时间近似方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究矩阵列选择问题的动机在于寻找有效的子集选择标准，以在数据分析和机器学习等应用中识别最具代表性的特征列，提高计算效率和模型性能。

Method: 通过将优化问题转化为决策问题，推导了子集选择标准的最优值以及分区伪逆的表达式，分析了各种标准在计算复杂度上的性质。

Result: 证明了所有研究的列选择标准都是NP难问题，并且不存在多项式时间近似方案(PTAS)，表明这些优化问题在计算上具有内在的困难性。

Conclusion: 矩阵列选择问题在多种标准下都是计算困难的，这为实际应用中的近似算法设计提供了理论基础，并强调了在列选择过程中需要权衡计算复杂度和解的质量。

Abstract: We consider a variety of criteria for selecting k representative columns from
a real matrix A with rank(A)>=k. The criteria include the following
optimization problems: absolute volume and S-optimality maximization; norm and
condition minimization in the two-norm, Frobenius norm and Schatten p-norms for
p>2; stable rank maximization; and the new criterion of relative volume
maximization. We show that these criteria are NP hard and do not admit
polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS). To formulate the optimization
problems as decision problems, we derive optimal values for the subset
selection criteria, as well as expressions for partitioned pseudo-inverses.

Motivation: 复值函数逼近是经典逼近理论在复域的重要推广，为振幅和相位相关现象提供了严格框架。

Method: 构建了三种复Nevai算子：基于第一类切比雪夫多项式的广义Nevai算子用于连续函数逼近；Kantorovich型Nevai算子用于可积函数逼近；Hermite型Nevai算子用于保持高阶导数的函数逼近。

Conclusion: 提出的复Nevai算子家族能够有效逼近各类复值函数，在理论和应用上都具有重要意义。

Abstract: The approximation of complex-valued functions is of fundamental importance as
it generalizes classical approximation theory to the complex domain, providing
a rigorous framework for amplitude and phase-dependent phenomena. In this
paper, we study the Nevai operator, a concept formulated by the distinguished
mathematician Paul G. Nevai. We propose a family of complex Nevai interpolation
operators to approximate analytic as well as non-analytic complex-valued
functions along with real-life application in image processing. In this
direction, the first operator is constructed using Chebyshev polynomials of the
first kind, namely complex generalized Nevai operators for approximating
complex-valued continuous functions. We establish the approximation results for
the proposed operators utilizing the notion of a modulus of continuity. To
approximate not necessary continuous but integrable function, we define complex
Kantorovich type Nevai operators and establish their boundedness and
convergence. Furthermore, in order to approximate functions preserving higher
derivatives, we introduce complex Hermite type Nevai operators and study their
approximation capabilities using higher order of modulus of continuity. To
validate the theoretical results, we provide numerical illustrations of
approximation abilities of proposed family of complex Nevai operators.

Abstract: In two and three dimensions, this study is focused on the numerical analysis
of an eigenproblem associated with a fluid-structure model for sloshing and
elasto-acoustic vibration. We use a displacement-Herrmann pressure formulation
for the solid, while for the fluid, a pure displacement formulation is
considered. Under this approach we propose a non conforming locking-free method
based on classic finite elements to approximate the natural frequencies (of the
eigenmodes) of the coupled system. Employing the theory for non-compact
operators we prove convergence and error estimates. Also we propose an a
posteriori error estimator for this coupled problem which is shown to be
efficient and reliable. All the presented theory is contrasted with a set of
numerical tests in 2D and 3D.

Motivation: 需要有效处理包含Atangana-Baleanu型算子的分数阶微分方程，特别是那些具有非线性项的方程，现有方法在数值精度方面存在不足。

Method: 使用预测-校正方法，在每个子区间添加辅助中点，采用分段二次牛顿插值推导校正方案，分段线性牛顿插值推导中点和预测方案。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法能有效处理Atangana-Baleanu型非线性分数阶微分方程，相比其他方法显著提高了数值精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方案是处理Atangana-Baleanu型分数阶微分方程的有力技术，在数值精度方面相比现有方法有显著改进。

Abstract: In this paper, based on Newton interpolation we have proposed a numerical
scheme of predictor-corrector type in order to solve fractional differential
equations with the fractional derivative involving the Mittag-Leffler function.
We have added an auxiliary midpoint in each sub-interval, this allows us to use
a piecewise quadratic Newton interpolation to derive the corrector scheme. The
derivation of the schemes for the midpoint and the predictor is done by means
of a piecewise linear Newton interpolation. We present some illustrative
examples for initial value problems that involve fractional derivatives in the
sense of Atangana-Baleanu. The results of numerical experiments show that the
proposed scheme is a powerful technique to handle fractional differential
equations with nonlinear terms that involve operators of Atangana-Baleanu type.
Moreover, the proposed method significantly improves the numerical accuracy in
comparison with other methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现人工神经网络可以在适当条件下发展出类似生物镜像神经元的模式，这些模式能促进AI系统的合作行为和内在对齐，为AI对齐提供新的补充方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向超人类能力发展，当前主要依赖外部约束的对齐策略可能不足以应对未来超智能AI。研究探索能否通过发展类似生物镜像神经元的模式来实现AI的内在对齐。

Method: 使用新颖的Frog and Toad游戏框架，识别镜像神经元模式出现的条件，评估其对动作电路的影响，引入检查点镜像神经元指数(CMNI)量化激活强度和一致性。

Result: 适当规模的模型能力和自我/他人耦合促进了人工神经网络中共享神经表征的发展，这些类似镜像神经元的模式支持合作行为。

Conclusion: 基于镜像神经元动态的内在动机可以补充现有对齐技术，通过将类似共情机制直接嵌入AI架构中实现更好的对齐效果。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型局限于虚拟领域，而现实世界的实验和制造仍依赖人类监督，导致可重复性、可扩展性和可访问性受限。

Method: 开发Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX)系统，通过混合现实将智能推理与物理执行结合，实时观察和解释人类动作，提供3D视觉指导。

Result: 在柔性电子制造洁净室中实现，上下文感知推理准确率超过通用多模态大语言模型，实时纠错，并能向新手传递专业知识。

Conclusion: 建立了一类新的智能-物理-人类智能系统，将智能推理从计算领域扩展到物理领域，使科学研究和制造过程变得自主、可追溯、可解释和可扩展。

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境（如自动驾驶赛车）中，将期望行为映射到奖励函数很困难，传统方法需要大量人工设计。

Method: 结合LLM生成奖励函数、VLM基于偏好的评估和人类反馈，自动化搜索奖励函数空间。

Result: 系统能够生成与冠军级RL赛车智能体GT Sophy竞争的赛车智能体，并能产生新颖行为。

Conclusion: 为现实世界应用中的自动化奖励设计铺平了道路。

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) 是一个评估框架，用于测试大语言模型是否学习人类基本价值观还是仅学习表面偏好。通过控制深层价值观和浅层特征之间的混淆，发现模型平均深层价值观泛化率仅为0.30，所有模型都低于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分AI系统是学习基本人类价值观还是仅捕捉偏好数据中的表面模式，这对AI对齐至关重要。能捕捉深层价值观的系统能更稳健地泛化人类意图，而仅学习表面模式的风险产生不对齐行为。

Method: 使用新颖的实验设计，在训练阶段让LLMs接触深层和浅层特征故意相关的人类偏好数据，测试阶段打破这些相关性，测量模型的深层价值观泛化率(DVGR)。

Result: 在9个不同模型中，平均DVGR仅为0.30，所有模型基于深层价值观的泛化都低于随机水平。更大的模型DVGR略低于更小的模型。

Conclusion: DVB提供了对齐核心特征的可解释度量，表明当前LLMs在泛化深层人类价值观方面表现不佳，这对AI对齐提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了InsurAgent，一个基于大语言模型的智能体，用于模拟洪水保险购买决策行为，解决了LLMs在定量概率估计上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国高风险人群的洪水保险参与率很低，需要理解保险决策的行为机制。大语言模型在模拟人类决策方面具有潜力，但存在定量概率估计的局限性。

Method: 构建基准数据集评估LLMs能力，提出InsurAgent智能体，包含感知、检索、推理、行动和记忆五个模块，使用RAG技术基于调查数据进行决策，利用LLM常识进行推理推断。

Result: InsurAgent能够准确估计边际和双变量概率，捕捉传统模型难以处理的上下文信息，支持时间决策演化的模拟。

Conclusion: InsurAgent为行为建模和政策分析提供了有价值的工具，结合了数据驱动方法和LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

TL;DR: 提出ATHENA框架，通过结合符号效用发现和语义适配来个性化建模人类决策过程，在旅行方式和疫苗选择任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体决策模型与群体最优预测存在差距，因为个体决策受数值属性（成本、时间）和语言因素（偏好、约束）共同影响，需要更人性化的建模方法。

Method: ATHENA框架包含两个阶段：1）通过LLM增强的符号发现找到群体级符号效用函数；2）基于最优效用进行个体级语义适配，创建个性化语义模板来建模个人选择。

Result: 在真实世界的旅行模式和疫苗选择任务中，ATHENA持续优于基于效用、机器学习和其它LLM的模型，F1分数比最强前沿模型至少提升6.5%。

Conclusion: 通过有机整合符号效用建模和语义适配，ATHENA为建模以人为中心的决策提供了新方案，消融研究证实两个阶段都至关重要且互补。

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: STRMAC框架通过状态感知路由和自演进数据生成，有效解决了多智能体系统中的协作效率问题，为复杂任务解决提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\method的框架，用于提升大语言模型在复杂表格数值推理任务上的性能，通过查询分解、表格清理和程序化推理三个组件来解决复杂查询、噪声数据和数值能力限制等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理表格数据的复杂推理时表现不佳，主要面临复杂查询、噪声数据和有限数值能力的挑战，需要开发专门框架来提升性能。

Method: \method框架包含三个核心组件：查询分解器将复杂问题拆解为子问题，表格清理器对噪声表格进行清洗和过滤，基于程序化思维(PoT)的推理器生成可执行代码从清理后的表格中推导最终答案。

Result: 在TAT-QA、TableBench和\method数据集上分别实现了8.79%、6.08%和19.87%的准确率提升，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了LLM在复杂表格数值推理任务上的性能，能够与主流LLM无缝集成，为复杂表格数值推理提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a
robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing LLM performance for
complex tabular numerical reasoning. Data and code are available upon request.

Conclusion: Deep Ideation框架通过整合科学概念网络和迭代优化流程，显著提升了LLM生成研究创意的质量和实用性

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析多模态大语言模型中模态跟随行为的新框架，将模态跟随分解为相对推理不确定性和固有模态偏好两个核心因素，揭示了模态跟随概率随相对不确定性单调下降的普遍规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅用粗粒度的数据集级统计来衡量多模态模型处理矛盾信息的能力，忽略了模型在单模态推理中的置信度影响，需要更精细的分析框架。

Method: 构建可控数据集系统变化视觉和文本输入的推理难度，使用熵作为细粒度不确定性度量，通过层间预测分析揭示内部机制。

Result: 发现模态跟随概率随相对不确定性单调下降的普遍规律，在平衡点附近模型会在不同模态间振荡，解释了外部观察到的犹豫现象。

Conclusion: 相对不确定性和固有模态偏好是控制模态跟随的两个基本原则，提供了量化框架和机制性见解来解释MLLM如何解决冲突信息。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

Conclusion: 通过因果影响测量和可验证奖励机制，可以有效解决多智能体推理中的协作问题，提升整体推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women
worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

TL;DR: ReAcTree是一种分层任务规划方法，通过构建动态代理树将复杂目标分解为可管理的子目标，结合推理、行动和记忆系统，显著提升复杂长时程任务的执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的决策方法在处理复杂长时程任务时表现不佳，因为它们依赖单一轨迹来整合所有历史决策和观察，试图在一个统一过程中解决整个任务。

Method: 提出ReAcTree分层任务规划方法：1）将复杂目标分解为可管理的子目标；2）构建动态代理树，每个代理节点负责处理子目标；3）集成两种记忆系统：情景记忆（检索目标特定示例）和工作记忆（共享环境观察）。

Result: 在WAH-NL和ALFRED数据集上的实验表明，ReAcTree在多种大语言模型上均优于ReAct等强基线方法。在WAH-NL上，使用Qwen 2.5 72B时达到61%的目标成功率，几乎是ReAct（31%）的两倍。

Conclusion: ReAcTree通过分层分解和动态代理树结构，结合互补记忆系统，有效解决了复杂长时程任务规划问题，显著提升了任务执行成功率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖标准答案验证，无法应用于缺乏真实解的开放式任务（如创意写作、指令遵循），但这类任务中推理能力仍有潜在价值。

Method: 提出可验证多选重构(VMR)策略，将开放式数据重构为可验证的多选格式，从而在缺乏明确标准答案的情况下实现有效训练。

Conclusion: VMR方法成功将RLVR范式扩展到开放式任务，证明强化推理能力确实能提升开放式任务性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

Conclusion: Agentic AI为5G/6G网络自动化管理提供了新范式，能够有效应对动态RAN环境的优化挑战，具有重要的应用前景。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

Result: 在Overcooked和Minecraft两个代表性游戏环境中的实验表明，KLPEG能更准确定位受更新影响的功能，用更少步骤完成测试，显著提升测试效果和效率。

Conclusion: KLPEG框架通过知识图谱和LLM的结合，有效解决了游戏增量更新的测试挑战，实现了知识的积累和重用，提升了测试的精准性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

Conclusion: 自适应屏蔽框架能够优雅地演化，确保活性可达成并仅在必要时削弱目标，相比静态屏蔽在维持最优性能和逻辑合规性方面表现更优。

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

Result: 系统能够生成符合人类心理学的可信行为，提供前所未有的透明度和理论对齐。

Conclusion: 该系统体现了社会学习、认知学徒制、刻意练习和元认知原则，为心理模拟提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

### [135] [DecompSR: A dataset for decomposed analyses of compositional multihop spatial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02627)
*Lachlan McPheat,Navdeep Kaur,Robert Blackwell,Alessandra Russo,Anthony G. Cohn,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DecompSR是一个用于分析组合空间推理能力的大规模基准数据集和生成框架，包含超过500万个数据点，可独立变化组合性的多个方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要分析大型语言模型在组合空间推理方面的能力，特别是对生产性、系统性泛化的处理能力。

Method: 通过程序化构建数据集，确保构造正确性，并使用符号求解器独立验证数据集的正确性。

Result: LLMs在空间推理任务中难以处理生产性和系统性泛化，但对语言变化更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DecompSR提供了一个可证明正确且严格的基准数据集，能够独立变化组合性的关键方面，用于精细探测LLMs的组合推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

### [136] [The Collaboration Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02687)
*Tim R. Davidson,Adam Fourney,Saleema Amershi,Robert West,Eric Horvitz,Ece Kamar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个协作迷宫求解基准，用于评估异构AI代理之间的协作能力，发现存在'协作鸿沟'：单独表现良好的模型在需要协作时性能大幅下降，并提出'接力推理'方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI发展，我们将越来越多地依赖由独立开发、具有不同信息、权限和工具的代理组成的系统。这些系统的成功关键在于异构代理之间的有效协作，但目前缺乏大规模评估此类代理间协作的实证研究。

Method: 提出了一个协作迷宫求解基准框架，该框架能够：(i)隔离协作能力，(ii)调节问题复杂度，(iii)支持可扩展的自动评分，(iv)不限制输出格式以保持生态合理性。使用该框架评估了32个领先的开源和闭源模型在单独、同质和异质配对中的表现。

Result: 研究结果揭示了'协作鸿沟'：单独表现良好的模型在需要协作时性能大幅下降。协作可能完全崩溃，例如单独能很好解决迷宫的小型蒸馏模型在某些配对中几乎完全失败。发现从较强代理开始往往能改善结果，这启发了'接力推理'方法，即较强代理先主导，然后交给较弱代理，从而缩小大部分协作鸿沟。

Conclusion: 研究主张：(1)协作感知的评估方法，(2)开发增强协作能力的训练策略，(3)可靠激发代理潜在技能的交互设计，这些指导原则适用于AI-AI协作和人类-AI协作。

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

*Jiayu Liu,Cheng Qian,Zhaochen Su,Qing Zong,Shijue Huang,Bingxiang He,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CostBench是一个专注于成本效率的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理的经济推理和重新规划能力，发现在静态和动态环境下代理在成本优化规划方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理评估主要关注任务完成度，忽视了资源效率和适应性，特别是代理在变化环境中制定和调整成本最优计划的能力。

Method: 在旅行规划领域构建CostBench基准，包含可通过多种原子和复合工具序列解决的任务，支持四种动态阻塞事件（如工具故障和成本变化）来模拟现实世界的不确定性。

Result: 评估显示代理在成本感知规划方面存在显著差距：在静态设置中经常无法识别成本最优解（GPT-5在最难任务上精确匹配率低于75%），动态条件下性能进一步下降约40%。

Conclusion: CostBench通过诊断这些弱点，为开发既经济理性又鲁棒的未来代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

*Paul Castro,Nick Mitchell,Nathan Ordonez,Thomas Parnell,Mudhakar Srivatsa,Antoni Viros i Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了span query概念，作为推理服务器的通用接口，能够表达聊天、RAG、推理时缩放和智能体工作负载，通过优化KV缓存和注意力局部性实现10-20倍的TTFT减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理服务器过度优化聊天完成功能，无法有效支持新兴的非聊天用例（如RAG、推理时缩放、智能体工作负载），需要更通用的接口来提升KV缓存命中率。

Method: 引入span query作为推理调用的表达式树，通过交换性约束连接，在vLLM中仅修改492行代码即可实现高性能执行，并自动优化KV缓存局部性和注意力局部性。

Result: span query在两个不同的非聊天用例中实现了10-20倍的TTFT减少，注意力优化的span query在2b参数模型上的表现优于标准推理服务器使用8b模型的准确性。

Conclusion: span query为推理服务器提供了统一的接口，能够有效支持多样化的工作负载，显著提升性能并解决"迷失在中间"问题。

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LLM的半自动化方法，用于生成结合人类可读性和机器可解释性的形式化知识表示，应用于控制工程领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制工程研究产出的快速增长需要新的方法来结构化和形式化领域知识，以促进知识传递和协作。

Method: 基于PyIRK框架，利用语言模型将自然语言描述和数学定义（LaTeX源代码）转化为形式化知识图谱，并生成交互式语义层来增强源文档。

Result: 成功演示了如何将自然语言和数学定义转化为形式化知识图，并创建了交互式语义层来促进知识传递。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现控制工程领域易于访问、协作和可验证的知识库愿景做出了贡献。

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new
approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly
describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal
knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

TL;DR: 提出了模态破坏诊断框架，用于分析多模态大语言模型中的融合动态，识别哪些模态驱动预测、如何解决冲突以及何时一个流主导结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型快速发展，但其推理过程仍然不透明，不清楚哪个模态驱动预测、如何解决冲突或何时一个流主导结果。

Method: 提出轻量级、模型无关的评估层，将每个模态视为代理，生成候选标签和简短自评估用于审计。简单融合机制聚合这些输出，暴露贡献者（支持正确结果的模态）和破坏者（误导的模态）。

Result: 在多模态情感识别基准测试中的应用揭示了系统可靠性特征，提供了关于失败是否源于数据集伪影或模型限制的见解。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态推理提供了诊断支架，支持融合动态的原则性审计，并为可能的干预措施提供信息。

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion-MSP是一个创新的表格数据上下文学习架构，通过多尺度处理、块稀疏注意力和Perceiver风格记忆解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时实现了对高维表格的有效扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据建模中的关键挑战：特征类型异构性、多尺度复杂交互，以及现有方法在单尺度处理、密集注意力二次扩展和顺序组件处理方面的局限性。

Method: 引入三个关键创新：1) 多尺度处理捕捉层次特征交互；2) 块稀疏注意力结合窗口化、全局和随机模式实现可扩展效率；3) Perceiver风格记忆实现组件间安全双向信息流。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Orion-MSP达到或超越了最先进性能，同时能够有效扩展到高维表格。

Conclusion: Orion-MSP为高效的表格上下文学习建立了新标准，解决了现有架构的关键限制，实现了性能与可扩展性的平衡。

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,
developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to
heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple
scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN
and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to
gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,
current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature
processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with
quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component
processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and
cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce
Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)
multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)
block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for
scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style
memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across
diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance
while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new
standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在复杂AI控制环境中优化攻击策略的方法，通过将攻击能力分解为五个技能组件并分别优化，使用概率模型解决数据不足问题，显著提升了攻击强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI部署变得更加复杂和高风险，准确评估其风险变得至关重要。AI控制框架需要强大的攻击策略来进行评估，但在复杂智能体环境中，计算约束导致数据不足，这构成了主要挑战。

Method: 将攻击能力分解为五个组成技能：怀疑建模、攻击选择、计划合成、执行和隐蔽性，并分别优化每个组件。开发攻击动态的概率模型，在模拟中优化攻击超参数，然后将结果迁移到SHADE-Arena环境中。

Result: 该方法显著提高了攻击强度，将安全评分从基线0.87降低到0.41，表明攻击能力得到了实质性改进。

Conclusion: 通过技能分解和概率建模的方法，可以有效克服数据不足的限制，在复杂AI控制环境中优化攻击策略，为AI风险评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

TL;DR: Kosmos是一个AI科学家系统，能够自动化数据驱动的科学发现过程，通过结构化世界模型在数据分析和文献搜索代理之间共享信息，实现长达12小时、200次代理滚动的连贯研究，生成可追溯的科学报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI科研代理在采取多次行动后会失去连贯性，限制了发现的深度。需要开发能够进行长时间、连贯科学研究的AI系统。

Method: 使用结构化世界模型连接数据分析代理和文献搜索代理，进行并行数据分析、文献搜索和假设生成的循环，每个运行平均执行42,000行代码并阅读1,500篇论文。

Result: 独立科学家评估79.4%的报告陈述准确；单次20循环运行相当于6个月人工研究时间；有价值科学发现数量与循环次数呈线性增长；在代谢组学、材料科学等领域做出7项发现，其中3项独立重现未发表成果，4项为新颖贡献。

Conclusion: Kosmos证明了AI系统能够进行长时间、连贯的科学研究，产生可验证的发现，显著加速科学发现过程，为自动化科学研究提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

Motivation: 当前AI虽然能做出科学发现，但缺乏语义理解，使得这些发现难以被人类理解。需要建立一个框架将AI的洞察转化为可理解的科学知识。

Method: 采用神经符号AI框架，通过逻辑语义建立神经网络与逻辑之间的显式映射，统一现有的各种编码和知识提取方法。

Conclusion: 逻辑框架能为深度学习提供所需的语义基础，但在实践中识别语义编码仍面临类似心灵哲学中的困难。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

TL;DR: CudaForge是一个无需训练的多智能体工作流，用于自动生成和优化CUDA内核，通过迭代式的代码生成、测试和硬件反馈分析，显著提升了内核生成效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计CUDA内核成本高且耗时，现有自动方法生成的内核效率低、计算开销大且泛化能力差，需要更有效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用双智能体工作流：Coder负责生成初始内核，Judge负责测试正确性和分析硬件反馈（如Nsight Compute指标），两者迭代协作优化内核。

Result: 在KernelBench上达到97.6%的正确率，平均比PyTorch基线快1.68倍，显著超越OpenAI-o3和Kevin等SOTA模型，且在不同GPU和基础模型上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多智能体、无需训练的工作流能够实现成本效益高、可泛化且高性能的CUDA内核优化，为AI应用提供高效的自动内核生成方案。

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

Result: 通过多个数据示例表明，所提出的特征值熵评估指标在性能上优于文献中的标准评估方法。

Conclusion: 特征值熵是一种有效的分类评估指标，特别适用于类别不平衡的数据集，能够提供更准确的性能评估。

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate,
bijective mappings by regulating conformality distortion and volume distortion,
enabling robust control over deformation quality. The framework is inherently
compatible with gradient-based optimization and neural network architectures,
making it highly flexible and scalable to higher-dimensional settings.
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical image data
validate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed method in
complex registration scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical
optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization.
However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this
work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep

TL;DR: 提出Neural Green's Function，一种用于线性偏微分方程的神经解算子，通过模仿格林函数行为实现跨不规则几何和源/边界函数的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的解算子在泛化到未见过的源或边界函数时存在困难，需要设计对训练中具体函数不敏感的解算子。

Method: 从体积点云中提取每点特征，预测解算子的分解，通过数值积分评估解。设计模仿格林函数行为，仅依赖域几何。

Result: 在MCB数据集机械零件稳态热分析中，超越最先进神经算子，平均误差降低13.9%，比需要昂贵网格化的数值求解器快350倍。

Conclusion: Neural Green's Function实现了对线性PDE的鲁棒高效求解，在几何泛化和计算效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轮廓积分方法在求解广义特征值问题时，积分轮廓的选择严重依赖于特征值分布的先验知识，不当选择会导致计算开销大和数值精度差。

Method: 使用傅里叶神经算子快速预测GEP的谱分布，然后应用核密度估计自动确定最优积分轮廓，最后用优化后的轮廓指导轮廓积分求解器。

Conclusion: 通过结合深度学习的预测能力和经典求解器的数值严谨性，为处理高维矩阵的广义特征值问题提供了高效且鲁棒的新范式。

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合动态人口分布约束，能够生成高保真的人类轨迹数据，为城市规划、交通工程等领域提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化模型缺乏可解释性，特别是无法精确识别多个个性化方面及其不同程度的个性化水平，需要细粒度的自然语言解释。

Method: 提出了FineXL技术，能够为个性化图像生成模型提供自然语言描述，识别不同的个性化方面，并为每个方面提供量化分数来指示个性化程度。

Result: 实验结果显示，FineXL在多种图像生成模型上应用不同个性化场景时，能将可解释性准确率提高56%。

Conclusion: FineXL成功解决了个性化图像生成模型缺乏细粒度自然语言解释的问题，显著提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Motivation: 当前基于监督微调的方法在复杂工具使用场景中泛化能力不足，需要探索纯强化学习是否能有效激发模型内在推理能力并增强工具无关的泛化性。

Method: 提出动态泛化引导的奖励设计，从探索性到利用性工具使用模式逐步调整奖励，基于此设计训练Tool-Zero系列模型，直接从基础模型进行强化学习规模化训练。

Result: 实验结果显示，在相同设置下比SFT和RL-with-SFT模型性能提升超过7%，在跨数据集和数据集内评估中均保持一致的性能增益。

Conclusion: 纯强化学习方法能够有效激发语言模型的内在推理能力，实现工具无关的泛化，为训练工具增强的LLMs提供了新范式。

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定性研究样本量确定依赖主观的数据饱和原则，导致不一致性并威胁方法严谨性。需要更客观、系统的方法来标准化这一过程。

Method: 基于五种基础定性研究方法的数据集，开发集成学习模型。评估10个关键参数作为输入特征，训练多种ML算法（KNN、GB、RF、XGBoost、DT），并进行特征重要性分析。

Result: 机器学习模型表现出高解释力（测试R2约0.85），有效建模定性抽样决策中的复杂非线性关系。特征分析验证了研究设计类型和信息力量的关键作用。

Conclusion: 提出了基于网络的决策支持系统概念框架，为标准化样本量论证、增强透明度、加强定性研究认识论基础提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练流程过滤掉简单问题，导致模型主要在需要长推理链的难题上训练，使模型错误地将"思考更久"与"思考更好"等同，产生过度冗长的推理过程。

Method: 在RLVR训练中保留并适度加权中等难度问题，作为隐式长度正则化器，让模型接触可解决的短链任务来约束输出分布。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507上的实验显示，在保持基线AIME25准确率的同时，生成的解决方案平均缩短近两倍。

Conclusion: 通过保留中等难度问题可以实现"免费出现的简洁性"，模型学会解决更难问题而不增加输出长度，无需任何显式长度惩罚。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: grokking现象中神经网络在完全记忆训练数据后才出现泛化，这种现象的精确动态机制尚不清楚。本文旨在通过约束优化框架来理解后记忆化学习过程。

Method: 在无穷小学习率和权重衰减系数的极限下，形式化证明梯度下降在零损失流形上最小化权重范数。引入参数子集学习动态解耦的近似方法，推导两层网络第一层的后记忆化动态闭式解。

Result: 实验证实，使用预测梯度模拟训练过程能够重现grokking的延迟泛化和表示学习特征。

Conclusion: 后记忆化学习可以通过约束优化框架理解，梯度下降在零损失流形上最小化权重范数，这解释了grokking现象中的延迟泛化机制。

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS是一种严重疾病，患者生存期短且治疗反应差异大。现有研究受限于小样本、异质性队列和稀疏纵向数据，缺乏明确的临床有意义患者分群定义。

Method: 提出基于疾病进展评分的聚类方法，整合多个描述变量，研究多种距离度量方法（包括现成距离和弱监督学习方法），并与聚类算法结合，在353名ALS患者数据集上进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别具有临床意义的ALS患者亚群，为个性化医疗提供了有价值的工具，同时提高了结果对医学专家的可解释性。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

Conclusion: COFAP具有优越的效率和准确性，可直接应用于晶体多孔材料的高通量筛选。

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

*Prasanth K K,Shubham Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Output-Conditioned Gating机制，通过基于过去推断调节内部记忆门来实现自反思维，创建稳定反馈循环增强记忆保持。最终模型EchoLSTM在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准循环神经网络（包括LSTM）难以建模长程依赖关系，特别是在包含噪声或误导信息的序列中。

Method: 提出输出条件门控新架构原则，结合注意力机制构建EchoLSTM模型，实现自反思维和记忆门调制。

Result: 在Distractor Signal Task上达到69.0%准确率，比标准LSTM基线提升33个百分点；在ListOps基准上与Transformer模型性能相当（69.8% vs 71.8%），但参数效率高5倍以上。

Conclusion: 自反机制使模型具有更鲁棒的记忆系统，在保持高性能的同时显著提升参数效率。

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

*Manuel A. Hernandez Alonso,Michael Depass,Stephan Quessy,Numa Dancause,Ignasi Cos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroClean是一个无监督的EEG/LFP预处理管道，通过五步流程自动去除脑电信号中的伪影和噪声，使用机器学习分类器确保任务相关信息保留，在运动任务分类中准确率从74%提升至97%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图和局部场电位记录中存在大量伪影和噪声，需要自动化预处理方法来提高数据质量，避免人为干预带来的偏差和可重复性问题。

Method: 五步预处理流程：包括带通滤波、线路噪声滤波、坏通道剔除，以及基于聚类算法的自动成分剔除的高效独立成分分析，使用机器学习分类器确保任务相关信息保留。

Result: NeuroClean有效去除了多种常见伪影，在复杂运动任务分类中，经过清理的数据在多项式逻辑回归模型中达到97%以上的准确率，而原始数据仅为74%。

Conclusion: NeuroClean是一个有前景的预处理管道和工作流程，可应用于未来研究，提高机器学习管道的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

*Donghee Lee,Hye-Sung Lee,Jaeok Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了bulk-boundary分解作为理解深度神经网络训练动态的新框架，将拉格朗日量分解为数据无关的bulk项和数据相关的boundary项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了深入理解深度神经网络的训练动态，揭示其内在结构和动态特性。

Method: 从随机梯度下降公式出发，将拉格朗日量重新组织为bulk项和boundary项，并基于此分解发展了神经动态的场论形式化。

Result: bulk捕获了由网络架构和激活函数设定的内在动态，boundary反映了训练样本在输入和输出层的随机相互作用，揭示了深度网络的局部和同质结构。

Conclusion: bulk-boundary分解为理解神经网络训练动态提供了新的理论框架，并自然扩展到场论形式化描述。

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TapOut是一种基于多臂老虎机的动态推测解码算法，无需超参数调优即可智能决定要推测的token数量，在各种模型对和数据集上实现了竞争性或更优的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通过轻量级草稿模型生成token并用大型目标模型并行验证来加速LLMs，但确定最佳推测token数量是关键挑战。现有方法依赖手动调整的敏感阈值，成本高且跨模型和领域泛化能力差。

Method: 提出TapOut算法，使用多臂老虎机在线选择无参数动态推测策略，基于历史奖励和探索选择最佳策略，无需训练即可即插即用。

Result: 在多样化模型对和数据集上的广泛实验表明，TapOut无需超参数调优即可实现与成熟动态推测基线竞争或更优的加速效果。

Conclusion: TapOut提供了一种高效、无需调优的动态推测解码解决方案，显著提升了推测解码的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

### [166] [Geometric Data Valuation via Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02100)
*Rodrigo Mendoza-Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于统计杠杆得分的几何替代方法，用于数据估值，满足Shapley公理，并能通过杠杆采样实现高效模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley数据估值虽然理论严谨但计算复杂度高，需要寻找可扩展的替代方法。

Method: 使用统计杠杆得分量化数据点在表示空间中的结构影响，扩展到岭杠杆得分以获得严格正边际增益。

Result: 杠杆采样训练得到的模型参数和预测风险与全数据最优解仅相差O(ε)，岭杠杆采样在主动学习中优于标准基线方法。

Conclusion: 杠杆得分提供了一种计算高效的数据估值方法，建立了数据估值与下游决策质量之间的严格联系。

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在微调于狭窄有害数据集后会出现广泛的对齐偏差现象，这种现象具有跨任务的线性结构特征，表现为参数更新方向的高度相似性和共享的低维子空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型在微调于狭窄有害数据集后如何发展出广泛对齐偏差现象的根本机制，目前对此现象的认识还很有限。

Method: 采用几何视角研究对齐偏差现象，分析微调权重更新的余弦相似度、主角度和投影重叠，以及通过线性模式连接性验证功能等价性。

Result: 发现不同狭窄对齐偏差任务的参数更新方向高度收敛，具有较高的余弦相似度和共享的低维子空间，插值模型在狭窄对齐偏差任务间保持一致的广泛对齐偏差行为。

Conclusion: 对齐偏差现象源于不同狭窄任务发现了相同的共享参数方向，表明有害行为可能组织在权重景观的特定可预测区域中，揭示了参数几何与行为结果之间的基本联系。

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经正切核理论的新路径协调持续学习框架，通过统计验证和路径质量评估来缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的核心问题，神经网络在学习新任务时会忘记先前学到的任务，需要找到有效的解决方案。

Method: 结合神经正切核理论的原则性可塑性边界、Wilson置信区间的统计验证，以及使用多种指标评估路径质量的新路径协调框架。

Result: 在Split-CIFAR10上达到66.7%的平均准确率，灾难性遗忘率为23.4%，接近最先进水平。发现NTK条件数>10^11时存在学习能力临界阈值。

Conclusion: 该框架具有统计保证，能有效降低遗忘率，确定了持续学习环境的核心能力限制，并为增强自适应正则化提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

TL;DR: 提出了RobustFSM，一种针对联邦子模最大化问题的鲁棒解决方案，能够抵御各种实际客户端攻击，在严重攻击情况下性能显著优于传统联邦算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦设置中子模最大化问题面临的客户端恶意行为挑战，保护客户端隐私和自主权的同时防止虚假信息攻击

Method: 开发了RobustFSM方法，通过重复聚合本地信息并设计鲁棒机制来抵御恶意客户端攻击

Result: 在真实数据集上的实证评估显示，当攻击严重时，RobustFSM的解决方案质量显著超过传统联邦算法，改进程度可达200%

Conclusion: RobustFSM为联邦子模最大化提供了一种有效的鲁棒解决方案，能够应对实际中的客户端攻击威胁

Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine
learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an
extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are
locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the
quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of
local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to
respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is
vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake
information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning,
but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of
submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular
maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its
performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using
real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of
RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm
when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset
and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示的原位训练协议，使用完整数据和草图数据的有限内存缓冲区，通过草图数据防止灾难性遗忘，在神经压缩应用中实现了高压缩率下的强重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式神经表示在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在原位神经压缩场景下，需要在不访问历史数据的情况下保持模型性能。

Method: 使用有限内存缓冲区存储完整和草图数据样本，将草图数据作为正则化器防止遗忘，基于Johnson-Lindenstrauss理论提供理论支持，针对隐式神经表示的超网络进行原位训练。

Result: 在复杂仿真数据的二维和三维任务上，实现了高压缩率下的强重建性能，草图方法使原位方案性能接近等效离线方法。

Conclusion: 草图方法有效解决了隐式神经表示持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，使原位训练性能接近离线训练，在神经压缩领域具有应用价值。

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测种间相互作用是微生物生态学的关键挑战，这些相互作用对确定微生物群落的结构和活性至关重要。

Method: 构建微生物配对相互作用的边图，利用图神经网络(GNNs)作为分类器，从单一培养生长能力、与其他物种的相互作用和系统发育数据中预测相互作用效应。

Result: 模型不仅能预测二元相互作用(正/负)，还能分类更复杂的相互作用类型如互利共生、竞争和寄生，F1分数达到80.44%，显著优于XGBoost的72.76%。

Conclusion: 图神经网络是预测微生物相互作用的有力工具，能够有效利用共享信息并显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

Motivation: 罕见事件（如金融危机、极端气候）由于稀缺性和重尾分布难以建模，传统深度生成模型容易忽略低概率模式或产生不确定度估计不准的问题。

Method: 结合深度隐变量模型和变分量子电路，使用混合损失函数联合优化重构保真度和尾部感知似然，通过量子随机性驱动的噪声注入增强样本多样性。

Result: 在合成高斯混合和真实数据集上，QEGM相比GAN、VAE、Diffusion等基线方法减少尾部KL散度达50%，提高罕见事件召回率和覆盖校准。

Conclusion: QEGM为罕见事件预测提供了原则性方法，展现出超越纯经典方法的鲁棒性潜力。

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

TL;DR: Flashlight是一个PyTorch生态系统中的编译器原生框架，能自动为任意基于注意力的程序生成融合的FlashAttention风格内核，无需依赖静态模板或预定义内核特化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多注意力变体需要专门的内核或手动调优实现，支持它们仍然困难。FlexAttention虽然解决了部分问题，但仅支持有限的注意力变体。

Method: 利用PyTorch的编译工作流程透明地融合和分块注意力计算，支持数据依赖的注意力公式，超越FlexAttention的能力范围。

Result: Flashlight生成的内核性能与FlexAttention相当或更优，同时提供原生PyTorch代码的灵活性。

Conclusion: Flashlight使开发者能够在不牺牲性能的情况下快速探索新的注意力模型，支持比FlexAttention更广泛的注意力变体。

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: 在LLM分类任务中，为标签添加解释（即使是随机token序列）能提升模型性能，主要原因是额外的token预算促进了更丰富的中间计算，起到正则化作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在LLM微调过程中，为标签附加简短解释是否能提升模型性能，并探索这种提升背后的机制。

Method: 使用多个LLM生成集成数据，对7B参数模型进行微调，比较标签加解释与仅标签训练的效果，并测试用随机token序列替代真实解释的情况。

Result: 在18个数据集和任务设置中，标签加解释训练均优于仅标签基线。令人意外的是，即使使用语义不连贯的随机token序列，也能显著提升准确率，缩小与真实解释的差距。

Conclusion: 解释增强的微调（无论是真实解释还是构造的随机token序列）能提高LLM分类的准确性和可靠性，关键在于额外的token预算促进了更丰富的中间计算，减少了过度自信的捷径行为。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Motivation: 可穿戴传感器和AI在客观步态分析中至关重要，但模型易受隐藏数据集偏差影响，且任务特定的传感器优化仍是挑战。

Method: 多流注意力深度学习框架，应用于Voisard等人的多队列步态数据集，模型注意力机制定量发现数据集混淆。

Result: 在OA和CVA筛查任务中，模型将超过70%注意力分配给右脚，而统计上忽略左脚（注意力<0.1%），这反映了公开数据集中的严重偏侧性偏差。

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

TL;DR: 开发一个求解器，用于最大化二元变量的实值函数，通过估计目标函数及其子实例的最优值，使用期望总偏差作为损失函数进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二元变量实值函数最大化问题，避免直接计算策略值或依赖已解决的实例，提高求解效率。

Method: 基于算法估计目标函数及其子实例的最优值，利用不等式将期望总偏差作为损失函数进行训练。

Result: 提出了一种不依赖策略值计算或已解决实例的求解器，能够有效估计最优目标函数值。

Conclusion: 该方法通过使用期望总偏差作为损失函数，提供了一种高效求解二元变量实值函数最大化的新途径。

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了对比一致性搜索(CCS)方法，将其重新表述为特征值问题，提出了相对对比一致性的概念，并扩展到多变量情况，避免了随机初始化的敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS作为一种无监督探测方法，能够测试大语言模型是否在其内部激活中表示二元特征（如句子真值），但其双目标函数仅被部分理解，需要澄清其机制并扩展其适用性。

Method: 将CCS重新表述为特征值问题，得到具有可解释特征值的闭式解，并自然扩展到多变量情况，基于相对对比一致性的概念进行优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，新方法恢复了与CCS相似的性能，同时避免了随机初始化的敏感性问题。

Conclusion: 相对化对比一致性不仅改进了对CCS的理解，还为更广泛的探测和机制可解释性方法开辟了途径。

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

*Jucheng Shen,Yeonju Ro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT)方法，通过单序列校准阈值来加速掩码扩散语言模型的并行解码，在多个基准测试中实现显著的准确率-吞吐量权衡提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到现有并行解码方法使用固定全局置信度阈值存在块级和步级置信度波动问题，且在同一数据集中不同输入的置信度轨迹高度相似，这为动态阈值校准提供了机会。

Method: OSDT方法：在单个序列上校准置信度阈值，然后将这些阈值应用于后续输入，实现动态阈值调整而几乎不增加开销。

Result: 在GPQA、GSM8K和HumanEval基准测试中，OSDT实现了优越的准确率-吞吐量权衡：在GSM8K上最佳准确率时吞吐量提升24%，在GPQA上准确率相当但吞吐量提升45%，在HumanEval上吞吐量提升50%但准确率略有下降。

Conclusion: 研究发现可重用的任务级置信度特征为扩散解码中的算法和系统创新提供了更广泛的机遇。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their
autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and
sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM
enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we
observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a
dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by
cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot
Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence
and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K,
and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24%
tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy,
and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our
findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level
confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems
innovations in diffusion decoding.

Motivation: 现有方法主要在架构层面融入物理知识，但需要更直接地在损失函数中利用物理信息，以获得物理意义明确的优化目标。

Method: 假设数据处于热平衡状态，使用反向KL散度结合玻尔兹曼分布，推导出数据与模型预测之间的能量差作为损失函数。

Result: 在分子生成和自旋基态预测任务中，相比基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了物理意义明确的损失函数，能更好地对齐有效配置，同时保持架构无关性和计算效率，并固有地尊重物理对称性。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化世界模型的框架，使用离散过程（逻辑、符号）和连续过程（物理、动力学）作为基本构建块，通过层次组合构建世界模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界建模领域碎片化，研究者开发定制架构而很少相互借鉴，需要一个统一的框架来整合离散和连续过程建模。

Method: 使用隐马尔可夫模型（HMMs）和切换线性动态系统（sLDS）作为离散和连续建模的基本构建块，通过固定因果架构并仅搜索四个深度参数来避免组合爆炸。

Result: 在被动建模（生成、预测）和主动控制（规划、决策）方面表现与神经网络方法相当，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 这些自然构建块可能为世界建模提供基础架构，类似于标准化层在深度学习中的作用，但可扩展的联合结构参数学习仍是核心挑战。

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

Method: 采用在线学习技术适应数据漂移，提出不确定性引导的在线集成方法，利用深度高斯过程近似进行不确定性估计，通过元算法结合不同历史数据训练的多个学习器。

Result: 在线学习相比静态模型减少80%预测误差；不确定性引导的在线集成方法相比标准单模型在线学习分别减少约6%和10%的预测误差。

Conclusion: 在线学习对维持聚变应用中机器学习模型性能至关重要，不确定性引导的在线集成方法能进一步改善性能并提供决策支持的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

Motivation: 地理INRs旨在将地球数据压缩为紧凑的学习友好表示，但缺乏对其信息内容和分布的理解。

Method: 分析不同环境维度(256-512)的地理INRs，研究其内在维度对空间分辨率和输入模态的敏感性。

Result: 地理INRs的内在维度在2-10之间，与下游任务性能相关，能捕捉空间伪影，有助于模型评估。

Conclusion: 内在维度提供了架构无关、无标签的信息内容度量，可用于INRs的无监督评估、模型选择和预训练设计。

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归任务中常用的均方误差损失在非高斯或重尾噪声下不可靠，需要开发更鲁棒的损失函数来提升机器学习任务的稳定性。

Method: 采用基于非参数回归的鲁棒损失，使用核密度估计残差分布并最大化估计的对数似然，该损失在误差为高斯分布时等同于MSE损失，但在更一般设置下保持稳定。

Result: 理论和实证分析表明，新损失函数在处理大噪声和多样化噪声分布方面表现出色，通过分析限制等距性质常数的上界来研究其对优化景观的重塑效果。

Conclusion: 通过简单地改变损失函数可以增强机器学习任务的鲁棒性，提供了一个直观且广泛适用的分析框架。

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

Motivation: 现有方差依赖的遗憾界研究主要集中在UCB类算法，而基于采样的算法如Thompson Sampling研究不足。唯一的例外LinVDTS算法仅限于线性奖励函数且遗憾界在模型维度上不是最优的

Method: 扩展了分离系数技术，提出了FGTSVA算法，这是一种方差感知的Thompson Sampling方法，适用于一般奖励函数的上下文赌博机问题

Result: FGTSVA实现了$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$的遗憾界，其中$\mathrm{dc}$是新的分离系数，$|\mathcal{F}|$是模型空间大小，$\sigma_t^2$是噪声的次高斯范数

Conclusion: 在上下文线性赌博机设置中，FGTSVA的遗憾界与使用加权线性回归的UCB类算法相匹配，填补了Thompson Sampling在方差感知遗憾界分析方面的空白

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

Conclusion: CausalDDS作为预测药物协同作用和促进药物发现的实用工具具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only

fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注加法和乘法，而减法作为非交换运算具有结构独特性，却很少被系统研究

Method: 评估了8个预训练LLM在加减法问题上的表现，通过探测分析了解模型内部表示，并测试了小样本学习和指令调优技术

Result: 减法准确率远低于加法，错误主要集中在a<b的情况，LLMs能内部编码负号信息但输出时经常遗漏，指令调优模型能达到接近完美的负号生成准确率

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在减法运算中的局限性，但通过指令调优可以恢复其算术能力，为理解LLMs数学能力提供了更清晰的表征

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

TL;DR: OmniField是一个多模态时空学习框架，能够处理稀疏、不规则和噪声数据，通过跨模态融合和迭代优化实现统一的时空重建、插值、预测和跨模态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界实验数据中多模态时空学习面临的两个挑战：模态内测量数据稀疏、不规则且存在噪声，但跨模态相关；可用模态在时空上变化，需要模型能够适应任意模态子集。

Method: 提出OmniField框架，学习以可用模态为条件的连续神经场，通过多模态交叉块架构和迭代跨模态优化在解码器前对齐信号，无需网格化或替代预处理。

Result: 在广泛评估中，OmniField始终优于八个强大的多模态时空基线方法。在严重模拟传感器噪声下，性能仍接近干净输入水平，显示出对损坏测量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniField框架通过跨模态融合和迭代优化，有效解决了多模态时空学习中的数据稀疏性和模态变化问题，展现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

*Abhishek Panigrahi,Bingbin Liu,Sadhika Malladi,Sham Kakade,Surbhi Goel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GRACE评分方法，无需验证器、教师模型内部信息或测试数据，通过分析学生模型梯度分布特性来量化教师模型对特定学生任务的蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏需要为特定学生-任务组合选择最优教师模型，传统方法依赖昂贵的试错过程，需要更高效的教师选择策略。

Method: GRACE通过测量学生模型梯度的分布特性，从信息论角度连接梯度算法的留一稳定性，控制蒸馏学生的泛化性能。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH数据集上，GRACE与LLaMA和OLMo学生模型的蒸馏性能强相关（斯皮尔曼相关性达86%），使用GRACE选择的教师可将性能提升7.4%。

Conclusion: GRACE能高效有效地为给定学生识别强兼容教师，并为蒸馏过程提供细粒度指导，包括最佳温度设置、尺寸约束下的最佳教师选择等。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by
large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but
selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires
expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to
quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.
GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without
access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an
information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of
gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the
distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%
Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo
students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher
can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the
best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design
choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when
generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size
constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively
identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide
fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

*Fan Feng,Phillip Lippe,Sara Magliacane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIOC-WM是一个学习对象及其交互结构化表示的世界模型框架，通过解耦和模块化的交互表示来提升策略学习的样本效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对象的RL方法通常只对单个对象进行状态分解，而将对象间的交互关系隐式处理，这限制了策略的鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Method: 从像素中学习对象中心潜在表示和交互结构，利用预训练视觉编码器；世界模型将任务分解为可组合的交互原语；采用分层策略：高层选择交互类型和顺序，低层执行交互。

Result: 在模拟机器人和具身AI基准测试中，FIOC-WM相比世界模型基线方法，显著提升了策略学习的样本效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 显式、模块化的交互学习对于实现鲁棒控制至关重要。

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态重路由token到专家映射的框架，通过减少激活专家数量来降低MoE模型的解码延迟，同时保持模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在自回归生成时经常进入内存受限状态，因为平均专家负载增长比等效的密集前馈层慢，导致MoE延迟受激活专家数量控制。

Method: 使用批量感知路由框架，让token搭载已被加载到内存中的专家，这些专家对同一批次中的其他token至关重要。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B和Qwen3-235B模型上，批量大小为16时，MoE层解码延迟分别降低了39%和15%，且没有统计显著的精度损失。

Conclusion: 提出的动态重路由方法能有效降低MoE模型的解码延迟，同时保持模型质量，为MoE架构的推理优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频谱偏置的神经网络初始化框架，通过调整SWIM算法中的尺度因子，使早期隐藏层捕获低频分量，晚期隐藏层表示高频分量，从而提升训练性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络参数初始化对学习性能有重要影响，好的初始化甚至可以避免额外的反向传播训练。同时，神经网络存在频谱偏置现象，即早期层倾向于学习粗粒度信息。本研究旨在利用频谱偏置信息来改进神经网络初始化。

Method: 提出一个框架，调整SWIM算法中的尺度因子，使早期隐藏层专注于捕获低频分量，晚期隐藏层专注于表示高频分量。

Result: 在一维回归任务和MNIST分类任务上的数值实验表明，所提方法优于传统的初始化算法。

Conclusion: 这项工作阐明了频谱特性在神经网络学习中的重要性，并产生了一种有效的参数初始化策略，能够增强神经网络的训练性能。

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Abstract: Probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts offer a differentiable alternative to
spectral clustering, enabling end-to-end and online learning without
eigendecompositions, yet prior work centered on RatioCut and lacked general

framework that covers a wide class of cuts, including Normalized Cut. Our
framework provides tight analytic upper bounds on expected discrete cuts via
integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions with closed-form
forward and backward. Together, these results deliver a rigorous, numerically
stable foundation for scalable, differentiable graph partitioning covering a
wide range of clustering and contrastive learning objectives.

Motivation: 光滑性在离线优化加速和在线学习的梯度变化后悔最小化中都很重要。这两种问题密切相关，加速优化可以通过梯度变化在线学习的视角来理解。本文旨在研究更一般的Hölder光滑函数类，探索其对离线优化的意义。

Method: 针对(强)凸在线函数，设计了相应的梯度变化在线学习算法，通过在线到批处理的转换获得随机凸优化的通用方法。对于离线强凸优化，结合在线自适应性和基于检测的猜测检查程序。

Conclusion: 首次提出了一个通用离线方法，在光滑情况下实现加速收敛，同时在非光滑情况下保持接近最优的收敛性，解决了离线强凸优化中的普适性问题。

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据同化方法在系统动态方程未知时面临挑战，且实际中难以获得无噪声的真实状态序列作为训练数据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了从噪声观测直接学习动态系统的问题，为未知动态系统的状态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网系统快速增长，高维多变量时间序列异常检测面临隐私、可扩展性和通信效率挑战。传统联邦学习方法难以处理高度非线性决策边界和不平衡异常分布。

Method: 使用参数化量子电路在量子边缘节点本地计算压缩核统计量，仅与中央服务器共享这些摘要，构建全局Gram矩阵并训练决策函数（如Fed-QSVM）。

Result: 在合成工业物联网基准测试中，FQKL在捕捉复杂时间相关性方面比经典联邦基线具有更好的泛化能力，同时显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了量子核在联邦设置中的潜力，为下一代物联网基础设施的可扩展、鲁棒和量子增强智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FP8-Flow-MoE是一种针对大型MoE模型的FP8训练方法，通过量化一致的数据流和融合算子，显著提升训练效率并减少内存使用，同时保持收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低精度训练方法在MoE模型中仍依赖BF16数据流，频繁的量化-反量化转换侵蚀了FP8的理论效率，而完全使用FP8又会导致双重量化误差问题。

Method: 提出量化一致的FP8中心数据流，包含缩放感知转置和融合FP8算子，将显式转换操作从12次减少到2次。

Result: 在671B参数MoE模型上，相比BF16和朴素FP8基线，吞吐量提升高达21%，每GPU内存使用减少16.5GB，同时保持稳定收敛。

Conclusion: FP8-Flow-MoE提供了一种即插即用的FP8训练方案，兼容TransformerEngine和Megatron-LM，将在未来开源。

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

Motivation: 重新审视语言模型推理中的测试时扩展策略，探讨在相同token预算和计算资源下，并行运行多个独立推理链与顺序迭代精炼推理链哪种方法更优。

Method: 在5个先进开源模型和3个挑战性推理基准上进行全面评估，比较并行自一致性解码与顺序扩展策略，并引入逆熵加权投票方法。

Result: 顺序扩展在95.6%的配置中优于并行自一致性，准确率提升最高达46.7%；逆熵加权投票进一步提高了顺序扩展的成功率。

Conclusion: 顺序精炼应成为现代LLM推理的稳健默认策略，这挑战了自Wang等人自一致性解码以来主导测试时扩展的并行推理正统观念。

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

Motivation: 头颈癌治疗计划制定困难，传统碳离子治疗因相对生物有效性建模复杂导致优化过程缓慢，现有深度学习方法存在数据偏差和计划可行性问题，强化学习方法在指数级大的参数搜索空间中探索效率低。

Method: 使用集中训练分散执行的多智能体强化学习框架，结合Double DQN、Dueling DQN和循环编码，采用紧凑的历史DVH向量作为状态输入，线性动作到值变换映射，以及基于临床知识的奖励函数设计。

Result: 在头颈癌数据集上，该方法同时调优45个参数，生成的治疗计划质量与专家手动计划相当或更好（相对计划得分：RL 85.93±7.85% vs Manual 85.02±6.92%），对五个危及器官有显著改善。

Conclusion: 该框架能够高效探索高维治疗计划参数空间，通过与治疗计划系统直接交互生成具有临床竞争力的碳离子治疗计划，显著改善了危及器官的保护效果。

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

TL;DR: HYSTL是一个超网络增强的时空学习框架，用于跨城市犯罪预测，能够在不假设不同城市犯罪类型相同的情况下训练统一的预测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有犯罪预测方法难以处理不同城市犯罪类型数据可用性差异大的问题，需要一种能够跨城市统一训练更强预测器的方法。

Method: 使用超网络动态生成预测函数参数，基于犯罪知识图谱学习犯罪类型表示，通过犯罪类型间的关联关系指导预测。

Result: 在两个犯罪类型不重叠的城市上进行实验，结果显示HYSTL优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: HYSTL框架能够有效解决跨城市犯罪预测中的犯罪类型差异问题，通过超网络和知识图谱实现更好的预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*David Nabergoj,Erik Štrumbelj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种因子化预条件架构，通过结合线性组件和条件归一化流来降低NF复杂度，提高对目标几何结构的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性预条件器对于中等复杂度的目标分布足够，但非线性预条件器（如归一化流）可能因过参数化而降低采样效率。现有NF方法无法自适应调整架构以适应目标分布。

Method: 使用因子化预条件架构：线性预条件器处理近似高斯分布的维度（基于预热样本估计），条件归一化流处理更复杂的维度。

Result: 在两个复杂合成分布上获得显著更好的尾部样本，在稀疏逻辑回归后验上表现一致更好，在具有弱似然和强漏斗几何的分层贝叶斯模型后验上获得更高的有效样本量。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于数据有限的分层贝叶斯模型分析，可为神经MCMC设计的理论和软件发展提供参考。

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines
into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络在动态图分布偏移下泛化能力差，需要研究非平稳环境演化对OOD泛化的影响。

Method: 使用环境序列变分自编码器建模环境演化，结合环境感知不变模式识别机制，通过实例化环境样本对节点进行细粒度因果干预。

Result: 在真实世界和合成的动态数据集上，EvoOOD在分布偏移下表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 这是首次从环境演化角度研究动态图OOD泛化问题，提出的框架能有效识别时空不变模式用于OOD预测。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

TL;DR: LUMA-RAG是一个终身多模态代理架构，解决了多模态RAG系统中的索引新鲜度和跨模态语义一致性挑战，通过流式多级内存系统、跨模态对齐桥和稳定性感知检索遥测实现高效的多模态检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理从静态知识库转向连续的多模态流（文本、图像、视频、音频），面临两个关键挑战：在不产生过高重新索引成本的情况下保持索引新鲜度，以及在异构嵌入空间中保持跨模态语义一致性。

Method: 提出LUMA-RAG架构，包含三个关键创新：(1)流式多级内存系统，在严格内存预算下动态将嵌入从热HNSW层溢出到压缩IVFPQ层；(2)流式CLAP->CLIP对齐桥，通过增量正交Procrustes更新保持跨模态一致性；(3)稳定性感知检索遥测，通过联合约束对齐漂移和量化误差提供Safe@k保证。

Result: 实验显示实现了稳健的文本到图像检索（Recall@10 = 0.94），在乘积量化卸载下性能优雅下降，以及可证明稳定的音频到图像排名（Safe@1 = 1.0）。

Conclusion: LUMA-RAG被确立为生产多模态RAG系统的实用框架，能够有效处理多模态流数据并保持检索性能的稳定性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN、H-Infinity滤波器和LSTM的新型架构，用于从心音记录中检测心律失常，在PhysioNet数据集上达到99.42%的准确率和98.85%的F1分数。


<details>

Motivation: 手动诊断心律失常依赖视觉解释且具有主观性，现有深度学习模型在真实场景中泛化能力不足，特别是在处理小样本和噪声数据时表现不佳。

Method: 提出CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM架构，引入控制理论中的H-Infinity滤波器可训练参数，增强模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该架构通过结合H-Infinity滤波器显著提升了心律失常检测的鲁棒性和泛化性能，为生物医学信号处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有覆盖控制方法在未知环境中效果有限，需要开发能够自主探索并利用环境信息的去中心化算法。

Method: 每个智能体通过最小化结合期望位置成本和方差探索项的局部成本函数来自主确定轨迹，使用贪婪策略定期更新诱导点以实现可扩展的在线高斯过程更新。

Result: 仿真实验验证了算法的有效性，智能体能够自主探索未知环境并实现高效覆盖。

Conclusion: 该去中心化算法能够在未知环境中实现探索与利用的平衡，仅依赖局部观测和邻居通信即可有效工作。

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

Motivation: 解决机器遗忘问题，统一现有的一阶近似遗忘方法，在遗忘数据的同时不降低初始模型的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的可行更新和掩码技术为机器遗忘提供了一种有效且实用的解决方案，能够在不牺牲模型性能的情况下实现数据遗忘。

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了统计框架，将模型训练的不确定性（underspecification）作为额外方差分量，证明即使很小的随机种子变化也会显著增加支持性能优越性声明所需的证据强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习方法在医学影像中应用日益广泛，但许多报道的性能改进缺乏统计稳健性。现有分析未考虑模型训练不确定性——即使验证分数相似的模型在未见数据上可能表现不同。

Method: 扩展现有的统计框架，将模型训练不确定性作为额外方差分量进行建模，通过模拟实验分析随机种子变化对性能优越性声明的影响。

Result: 模拟实验表明，即使很小的随机种子变异性（约1%）也会显著增加支持优越性声明所需的证据强度。

Conclusion: 在验证医学影像系统时，需要明确建模训练方差，以提高统计结论的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱嵌入模型在无界欧几里得空间中存在建模复杂关系的固有局限性，可能导致训练效率低下。球形几何约束可以提供更强的正则化效果。

Method: 使用可学习的非线性球化层将实体映射到球面上，将关系解释为平移-投影的混合变换，在紧凑的球形流形上进行表示学习。

Result: 在FB15k-237、CoDEx-S和CoDEx-M三个基准数据集上，SKGE始终显著优于其欧几里得对应模型TransE，特别是在大规模基准上表现突出。

Conclusion: 流形选择不是实现细节而是基本设计原则，球形几何先验通过创建内在困难负采样环境，消除了平凡负样本，迫使模型学习更鲁棒和语义一致的表示。

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

Motivation: 高保真PDE模拟计算成本高，纯数据驱动代理模型在训练分布外不可靠，需要结合传统数值方法的稳定性。

Method: 使用学习到的解算子为共轭梯度、GMRES等Krylov方法生成高质量初始猜测，保持现有离散化和求解器基础设施不变。

Result: 在基准测试中，学习初始化持续减少迭代次数和端到端运行时间，计算时间最多减少90%，同时保持底层数值算法的稳定性和收敛保证。

Conclusion: NOWS通过结合神经算子的快速推理和传统求解器的严谨性，为加速高保真PDE模拟提供了实用可靠的方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Result: 在真实数据集上验证了BRAINS在疾病严重程度分类和早期认知衰退识别方面的有效性。

Conclusion: BRAINS作为辅助工具在可扩展、可解释的早期阿尔茨海默病检测方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

Motivation: 建立信息几何理论框架，将表示学习中的理解概念形式化，探索信息性与几何简单性之间的权衡关系，以获取几何一致、数据高效且符合人类理解结构的表示。

Method: 提出了变分几何信息瓶颈（V-GIB），通过可处理的几何代理（如Hutchinson迹、Jacobian范数和局部PCA）统一互信息压缩和曲率正则化。

Result: 实验表明存在稳健的信息几何帕累托前沿，曲率感知编码器在数据稀缺情况下保持预测能力，在解释效率方面获得显著提升。

Conclusion: V-GIB为获得几何一致、数据高效且与人类可理解结构对齐的表示提供了一条原则性和可测量的路径。

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

Motivation: CLRPs是组合优化中的经典问题，需要同时进行选址和路径决策。传统方法难以处理复杂约束和决策间的复杂关系，而深度强化学习在车辆路径问题上的成功应用表明其在CLRPs上的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器结构，将CLRPs重新表述为马尔可夫决策过程，并引入异构查询注意力机制来动态适应不同决策阶段，处理选址和路径决策间的相互依赖关系。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在解决CLRP和OCLRP时，相比代表性传统方法和基于DRL的基线方法，具有更优的解决方案质量和更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的DRLHQ方法是首个用于CLRPs的端到端学习方法，通过异构查询注意力机制有效处理了决策间的复杂依赖关系，在解决方案质量和泛化能力方面表现出色。

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

Method: 提出基于罗尔斯公平的解决方案概念，设计迭代改进最差高校效用的确定性和随机算法。

Result: 当稳定性无法保证时，该算法提供了一种实用的公平分配方法。

Conclusion: 在非线性效用函数的多对一匹配中，罗尔斯公平原则为解决稳定匹配不存在的问题提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: We study a many-to-one matching problem, such as the college admission
problem, where each college can admit multiple students. Unlike classical
models, colleges evaluate sets of students through non-linear utility functions
that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical
stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

*Mathieu Chevalley,Arash Mehrjou,Patrick Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了因果发现中假阴性率(FNR)的理论保证，证明了在高维稀疏图和尺度自由图中，FNR会围绕其均值集中，且在大规模设置中误差会消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维度和网络异质性对因果结构恢复准确性的影响，挑战了高维度和网络异质性必然阻碍准确发现的直觉。

Method: 使用稀疏Erdős-Rényi有向无环图和广义Barabási-Albert图，在单变量随机干预和ε-干预忠实性假设下分析FNR的集中性。

Result: 对于稀疏Erdős-Rényi图，FNR以O(log d/√d)速率集中；对于广义Barabási-Albert图，当度指数γ>3时，偏差宽度以O(d^{β-1/2})缩放且β<1/2，表明误差在大维度下消失。

Conclusion: 现实尺度自由拓扑结构内在正则化因果发现，减少方向误差的变异性，提供了首个维度自适应、忠实性鲁棒的因果结构恢复保证。

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的邻域约束方法来解决离线强化学习中的外推误差问题，通过将贝尔曼目标中的动作选择限制在数据集动作的邻域并集内，避免了现有约束方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习面临由分布外动作引起的外推误差问题。现有的约束方法（密度约束、支持约束和样本约束）各有局限性：密度和样本约束过于保守，而支持约束难以准确建模行为策略。

Method: 提出邻域约束方法，将贝尔曼目标中的动作选择限制在数据集动作的邻域并集内。使用数据质量作为适应标准设计自适应邻域约束，并基于高效的双层优化框架开发ANQ算法。

Result: 理论上证明该约束能够在外推误差和分布偏移上提供界限，无需行为策略建模即可近似支持约束。实验表明ANQ在标准离线RL基准上达到最先进性能，在噪声或有限数据场景下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 邻域约束方法有效克服了现有约束方法的局限性，通过自适应邻域半径实现点式保守性，为离线强化学习提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine
learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study
evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings
drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing
detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and
liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models
optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure
forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC
above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating
systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining
language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and
institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

TL;DR: NAIGNs通过结合重构损失和非对抗性生成目标（IMLE）改进了IGNs，解决了模式崩溃、模式丢失和训练不稳定性问题，能够更好地恢复损坏数据并生成与数据分布匹配的新样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IGNs存在模式崩溃、模式丢失和训练不稳定性问题，这些问题源于其目标函数中的对抗性成分，导致模型只能部分覆盖数据流形。

Method: 提出非对抗性幂等生成网络（NAIGNs），将重构损失与隐式最大似然估计（IMLE）的非对抗性生成目标相结合。

Result: NAIGNs改进了IGNs恢复损坏数据的能力，生成的新样本更接近数据分布，并隐式学习了到数据流形的距离场以及基于能量的模型。

Conclusion: NAIGNs通过非对抗性方法有效解决了IGNs的局限性，在数据恢复和生成质量方面表现出色，同时具备学习数据流形距离场的能力。

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

Motivation: 传统统计学习基本定理在可计算学习框架下不再成立，需要寻找新的理论框架来刻画可计算PAC学习特性。

Method: 引入有效VC维度概念，分析递归可枚举表示类与CPAC学习的关系，研究非均匀CPAC学习在不可知学习中的应用。

Result: 发现有效VC维度可以取任意大于传统VC维度的值；CPAC可学习类与RER类存在密切联系；非均匀CPAC学习可为RER类提供不可知学习保证。

Conclusion: 在可计算学习框架下，需要重新审视传统学习理论，有效VC维度和RER类为理解CPAC学习提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

Result: SAC算法在GasRL环境中表现最佳，能够成功实现存储运营商的多个目标，且其诱导的均衡价格动态特征（如波动性和季节性）与现实世界价格高度匹配。欧盟最低存储阈值政策对市场抵御意外供应冲击具有积极作用。

Conclusion: GasRL仿真器能够有效分析天然气市场动态，SAC算法在库存管理策略优化中表现优异，欧盟最低存储阈值政策有助于提升市场韧性，防止市场中断。

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

Motivation: Transformer架构存在二次方时间/内存复杂度和推理时需要缓存键值状态的问题，限制了吞吐量和可扩展性。状态空间模型(SSM)如Mamba提供了线性推理复杂度和恒定内存占用的替代方案。

Method: 通过增量蒸馏从预训练Transformer模型Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker逐步替换不太关键的自注意力层为线性Mamba块，构建不同SSM与MHA比例的混合模型变体。

Result: Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker在vLLM生产环境中实现超过2倍的推理吞吐量提升，同时推理性能仅有最小程度的下降。

Conclusion: 蒸馏的混合SSM-Transformer架构可以在不显著损害推理质量的情况下，相比预训练Transformer等效模型提供显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities
through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,
transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention
module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which
severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is
critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under
high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.
  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with
linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent
computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we
introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer
attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.
These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained
reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing
less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.
  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with
different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as
more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant
of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,
achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the
production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning
performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can
deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent
without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Byrd-NAFL算法能有效平衡通信效率和鲁棒性，在拜占庭攻击环境下实现快速安全的联邦学习。

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

### [233] [Does Interpretability of Knowledge Tracing Models Support Teacher Decision Making?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02718)
*Adia Khalid,Alina Deriyeva,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了可解释知识追踪模型对教师教学决策的实际帮助，发现虽然教师认为可解释模型更可信，但在实际教学效果上与非可解释模型差异不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识追踪模型对教学决策至关重要，但以往研究未验证其可解释性是否真正帮助教师做出更好的教学决策。

Method: 首先进行模拟研究比较可解释与非可解释模型的教学效果，然后让12名教师基于不同模型提供的信息进行教学决策实验。

Result: 模拟显示可解释模型能更快达到掌握水平，但教师实验中两种模型所需任务数量差异不大，尽管教师对可解释模型评价更高。

Conclusion: 模型可解释性与教师决策的关系并不直接，教师不完全依赖KT模型做决策，需要进一步研究师生如何理解和使用这些模型。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

TL;DR: 研究校准基础模型对误标签检测的影响，发现校准方法能提高检测准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中误标签数据普遍存在，会降低机器学习系统性能。需要有效方法检测误标签实例并进行过滤或重新标注。

Method: 训练基础机器学习模型，然后对每个实例进行探测以获得标签可信度分数，研究校准基础模型的影响。

Result: 实证结果表明，使用校准方法能提高误标签实例检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 校准方法为工业应用提供了实用有效的误标签检测解决方案。

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConMeZO是一种新颖的零阶优化器，通过自适应方向采样加速收敛，将采样限制在动量估计为中心的锥形区域内，在微调大语言模型时比MeZO快2倍，同时保持零阶方法的内存优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零阶优化（MeZO）在微调大语言模型时消除了反向传播的内存开销，但由于在高维参数空间中搜索下降方向，收敛速度较慢。

Method: 提出ConMeZO优化器，通过自适应方向采样，将采样限制在动量估计为中心的锥形区域内，而不是均匀随机采样，从而将搜索集中在真实梯度更可能存在的方向上。

Result: 理论上证明ConMeZO达到与MeZO相同的最坏情况收敛率；实证上，在自然语言任务上微调大语言模型时，ConMeZO比MeZO快2倍，同时保持零阶方法的内存优势。

Conclusion: ConMeZO通过自适应方向采样有效加速了零阶优化的收敛速度，在保持内存效率的同时显著提升了微调大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

<details>

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习从头开始训练效率低下，而单智能体经验更容易获取但现有方法仍依赖昂贵的多智能体数据

Method: SoCo框架：1）从单智能体演示中预训练共享单智能体策略；2）通过策略融合机制（MoE门控选择器和动作编辑器）在多智能体训练中适应协作

Result: 在多样化协作任务上的实验表明，SoCo显著提升了骨干算法的训练效率和性能

Conclusion: 单智能体演示为多智能体数据提供了可扩展且有效的补充，使协作学习更加实用和广泛适用

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

TL;DR: VecComp是ChannelComp框架的泛化版本，通过集成多天线技术实现向量函数计算，解决了原框架仅支持标量计算和对信道衰落敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ChannelComp框架仅限于标量函数计算，而许多数据应用需要向量计算，且对信道衰落敏感。需要扩展框架以支持向量计算并提高鲁棒性。

Method: 将ChannelComp与多天线技术结合，通过线性复杂度扩展实现向量函数计算，并增强对信道衰落的鲁棒性。

Result: 建立了VecComp在衰落信道条件下的均方误差非渐近上界，数值实验表明其在向量函数计算和衰落补偿方面的有效性。

Conclusion: VecComp为高维数据应用提供了计算高效且对信道损伤鲁棒的向量函数计算框架。

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

TL;DR: STAR-VAE是一个基于Transformer的变分自编码器，使用SELFIES表示法保证分子语法有效性，支持条件生成和高效微调，在分子生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物分子化学空间巨大，需要开发能够学习广泛化学分布、支持条件生成并提供快速分子生成的生成模型。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和自回归Transformer解码器的变分自编码器框架，在7900万个PubChem药物分子上训练，采用SELFIES保证语法有效性，通过属性预测器实现条件生成，使用LoRA进行高效微调。

Result: 在GuacaMol和MOSES基准测试中达到或超过基线水平，潜在空间分析显示平滑的语义结构表示，在Tartarus基准测试中条件模型将对接分数分布向更强预测结合方向偏移。

Conclusion: 现代化的、规模适当的VAE结合原则性条件生成和参数高效微调，在分子生成任务中仍具有竞争力。

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam优化器通过自适应更新隐式最小化一种独特的锐度度量，产生与SGD不同的解。在标签噪声的过参数化模型中，Adam最小化Hessian矩阵对角元素的平方根迹，而非SGD的最小化Hessian迹，这使Adam在稀疏线性回归中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Adam优化器在实践中很受欢迎，但大多数理论研究以SGD作为代理，对Adam找到的解与SGD的差异了解甚少。本文旨在揭示Adam优化器的独特行为机制。

Method: 通过随机微分方程的连续时间近似来严格描述Adam的行为，分析其在训练损失较小时在极小值流形上的游走行为，并比较Adam与SGD在过参数化模型中的不同表现。

Result: 在带标签噪声的过参数化模型训练中，SGD最小化Hessian矩阵迹tr(H)，而Adam最小化tr(diag(H)^{1/2})。在稀疏线性回归问题中，Adam比SGD实现了更好的稀疏性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: Adam通过自适应方式最小化独特的锐度度量，产生与SGD不同的解。该分析框架可扩展到RMSProp、Adam-mini等自适应梯度方法，为未来优化器设计提供统一视角。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data
learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains.
However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing
pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the
absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as
calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a
single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art
models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and

TL;DR: 提出一种基于量子计算启发的QUBO优化方法，通过选择少量最相关的客户端更新来大幅降低联邦学习中每个客户端的隐私暴露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中随着客户端更新被包含在聚合模型中的迭代次数增加，敏感数据暴露风险会累积增加。攻击者可以发起成员推理攻击、属性推理攻击和模型反转攻击，从而推断客户端特定属性甚至重建输入数据。

Method: 使用量子计算启发的二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)公式，在每轮训练中选择一小部分最相关的客户端更新，同时假设服务器可以访问具有全局数据分布的验证/测试集。

Result: 在MNIST数据集300个客户端20轮实验中，实现了95.2%每轮和49%累积隐私暴露减少，147个客户端的更新从未被使用，同时保持或优于全聚合准确率。在更复杂的CINIC-10数据集30客户端实验中，实现了82%每轮隐私改进和33%累积隐私提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低联邦学习中的隐私暴露风险，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少客户端参与频率，适用于不同规模和复杂度的模型。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测棒球比赛胜负概率并与获胜强度相关，但需要谨慎的投注策略才能获得收益，直接使用模型进行投注不可取。

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着遥感卫星数量和多样性的增加，大多数标注数据来自旧卫星，而基础模型的重新训练成本高昂，因此模型对新卫星的泛化能力变得至关重要。

Method: 扩展GeoBench基准测试，引入新的评估协议，包括测试分布内性能、无波段重叠卫星的泛化以及额外波段的泛化。开发了自监督的ChiViT模型。

Result: 1) 最佳遥感基础模型在分布内设置中不如通用模型DINOv3；2) 无波段重叠时所有模型性能下降2-4倍，ChiViT显著优于其他模型；3) 额外波段使所有模型性能下降5-25%；4) 微调最后一层可获得相对一致的跨卫星性能。

Conclusion: 基准测试远未饱和，需要开发更具未来适应性的遥感模型以增强跨卫星泛化能力。

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.
